"Bearing in mind he’s a dog, Don the border collie did a pretty good job yesterday of piloting a tractor across a motorway. To be fair, however, this probably wasn’t the first thought to strike rush-hour drivers as they watched him crash through a fence and come hurtling towards them. Like a scene from Wallace and Gromit, the intrepid sheepdog was at the controls when he sent the farm utility vehicle down a steep bank, on to the busy carriageway and into the central reservation barrier. Don's owner Tom Hamilton (pictured) was tending to a lamb when the sheepdog took control by nudging the controls . The tractor smashed through a fence before ending up on the road. Don was unhurt in the ordeal but the incident caused major tailbacks . Despite considerable damage, Don escaped unhurt – but left scores of motorists wondering if they were imagining things. Traffic Scotland tweeted a bizarre warning that there may be hold-ups ‘due to a dog taking control of tractor’, adding: ‘Nope, not joking.’ Appropriately, they couldn’t resist the hashtag: ‘#maycausetailbacks’. Observers and Twitter commentators joined the pun fun by speculating: ‘Police investigating – so far no leads’; or the inevitable: ‘This is barking.’ The incident happened at junction 13 of the M74, near Abington in South Lanarkshire. Sheep farmer Tom Hamilton was travelling across a field in the John Deere Gator farm vehicle with his companion in the passenger seat during their morning rounds. Behind the wheel: Don leaned on the controls of the tractor before driving it on to the M74 near Abington in South Lanarkshire during rush hour . The vehicle shot out of the field and crashed down a bank by the side of the road before colliding with the central reservation of the M74 near junction 13 northbound as shown by the red arrow . Moments after he got out of the vehicle, it took off with Don at the wheel. Safely back at nearby Kirkton Farm yesterday with Don at his side, Mr Hamilton explained: ‘I was sorting out one of the lambs and hadn’t put the brake on. ‘When I turned around I saw it racing towards the motorway. I ran after it but I couldn’t catch up.’ Traffic Scotland tweeted the news that a dog had 'taken control of a tractor' before adding, 'nope, not joking' Officers cleared the motorway within half an hour and Don was reunited with his relieved owner at nearby Kirkton Farm . Remarkably, drivers managed to avoid the runaway vehicle before it came to crashing halt, and none was hurt. Nor did the black and white border collie (a breed noted for its intelligence and obedience) panic or flee in terror. ‘He didn’t even bark,’ Mr Hamilton said. Police said Don had set the vehicle in motion by inadvertently leaning on the controls. ‘So far people seem to find it amusing,’ Mr Hamilton said. ‘But I think Don’s driving days are over.’ Monty, a giant schnauzer cross, was pictured driving a mini down a race track in New Zealand in 2012 ."
"Dana was transported to the Al-Mawa reserve via Turkey along with four other lions, two bears and two tigers in a three-month operation organised by the animal welfare charity Four Paws.
Staff found the cub, who they named Hajar, in her cage on Saturday.
They are now waiting to see whether Dana will give birth to a second cub.
Dr Amir Khalil, a vet who accompanied the animals, told the Associated Press on Sunday that an ultrasound performed in Turkey had shown she was carrying two.
However, he warned that the second cub might already have been born dead and been eaten by Dana.
Its fate will not be known until another ultrasound is carried out on Monday.
Four Paws said its team had initially been very concerned about whether Dana would accept or kill Hajar because of the enormous stress she had endured.
""But luckily that wasn't the case. She cleaned the cub and nursed it,"" the charity added. ""This is a true sign that she feels safe at Al-Mawa.""
Hajar's gender is unknown because staff have not been able to examine the cub."
"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Transition Training Fund should help keep expertise in the energy sector, or in related roles in manufacturing.
She said job losses were ""distressing"".
The fund will offer grants for individuals to acquire specialised skills or further training.
Ms Sturgeon was meeting industry leaders and attending an energy jobs task force in Aberdeen.
She said: ""It is absolutely crucial that we take every possible action to retain the expertise that the industry has built up over decades so that it remains flexible enough to capitalise on exploration investment and future oil price rises.""
Also announced was £12.5m of Scottish Enterprise funding aimed at helping oil and gas firms sustain growth and compete internationally by developing new innovative technologies.
The announcements - and plans for a £20m Aberdeen International Airport revamp - came just days after a £504m package was announced earlier by the UK and Scottish governments to improve infrastructure in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, and to attract new jobs.
North East Scotland Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald said: ""The Scottish government's offer of extra money to train those made redundant by the oil and gas industry is a step in the right direction but a year later than it should have been.
""This is the kind of initiative which should have been put in place when the North Sea saw the first signs of a crisis, not after an estimated 65,000 people have already lost their jobs.""
North East Scotland Lib Dem MSP Alison McInnes said: ""This is welcome support for the tens of thousands of people who have lost their jobs because of the downturn in the oil and gas industry.
""They are incredibly skilled staff whose experience cannot be wasted and who need to know the opportunities and help they need to retrain is available.
""What we now need to know is how exactly this fund will be distributed, who can apply and clear details as they come in of how many people are actually benefiting.""
The cost of a barrel of Brent crude oil has decreased from more than $100 in January 2014 to less than $30 in January of this year.
Tens of thousands of jobs are thought to have been lost."
"Paula Vasco-Knight, 53, broke down as she changed her plea on the second day of her trial at Exeter Crown Court.
She used £11,072 of NHS cash to pay her husband Stephen, 46, for work on an equality and diversity publication called Transform, which never existed.
Her husband also changed his plea to admit fraud.
More on the fraud case and other stories from Devon and Cornwall
Former nurse Vasco-Knight, of Runcorn, Cheshire, shook and sobbed uncontrollably as she changed her plea to one of the two charges of fraud she faced.
Recorder Don Tait adjourned sentence until March but warned the Vasco-Knights that a ""custodial sentence is a distinct possibility"".
He told the jury: ""As far as Mrs Vasco-Knight is concerned, she has fallen a long way, hasn't she, but that is her responsibility.""
Vasco-Knight was CEO at the South Devon NHS Foundation Trust and the national lead for equalities for NHS England when the offence occurred.
The newsletter was commissioned by her in April 2013 and produced by her husband's firm Thinking Caps that July, the court heard.
But it was a ""sham"", cut and pasted from a research paper by the Kings Fund charity, said Gareth Evans, prosecuting.
He said Vasco-Knight's failure to declare an interest in Thinking Caps was a criminal offence and a ""massive breach of trust and abuse of her position as chief executive"".
Vasco-Knight later tried to blame Habib Naqvi, a senior manager in the NHS, for commissioning the newsletter.
Mr Naqvi, 28, of Bristol, was cleared of two counts of aiding and abetting.
The prosecution offered no evidence on the second fraud charge against Mrs Vasco-Knight of swindling £9,000 from the NHS.
She and her husband were released on bail to 10 March for sentencing.
Sue Frith, managing director of NHS Protect, which conducted the investigation, said Vasco-Knight's meteoric career path had been ""an inspiration to so many"" and her fraud was a ""huge disappointment and shock to many""."
"Frances Bean Cobain has admitted she's not a big fan of her dad's music in a candid new interview. Speaking to Rolling Stone Magazine about  her documentary Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck, the frontman's daughter revealed she's not really into Nirvana. 'I don't really like Nirvana that much,' she said. 'Sorry, promotional people, Universal.' Scroll down for video . Nevermind: Frances Bean Cobain, pictured here in September, has revealed she isn't a huge fan of her late father Kurt's music . SAINT LAURENT Babies 40 suede boots . Buy at Net a Porter . Visit site . She’s the daughter of the once ultimate rock power couple, Courtney Love and Kurt Cobain, so it’s no surprise that Frances Bean Cobain has evolved into a rock chick with very expensive taste. Instead of wearing Converse like many young girls of her age might do, Frances turned to the grungiest high fashion designer of them all, Saint Laurent, when it came to choosing a pair of boots to invest in. Rocking a pussy bow black blouse with black embellished leggings, Frances made her knee-high suede booties the key piece of her outfit and they certainly make a grand statement with their luxe finish and eye-catching tan hue.

TOPSHOP DASHER Knee High Boots (now reduced to £60) Visit site . 'I'm more into Mercury Rev, Oasis, Brian Jonestown Massacre,' she revealed to the music mag. 'The grunge scene is not what I'm interested in.' However she does recognise her late father's genius, and admitted some of his songs still bring her to tears. 'Territorial P*ssings is a f**king great song. And Dumb, I cry every time I hear that song. It's a stripped-down version of Kurt's perception of himself; of himself on drugs, off drugs, feeling inadequate to be titled the voice of a generation.' The 22-year-old, who lost her dad to suicide when she was just 20 months old, said it wasn't awkward for her as a child not being a huge fan of his music. Abandoned: The 22-year-old was just 20 months old when the Nirvana frontman committed suicide, which she describes as being 'abandoned in the most awful way possible' 'I would have felt more awkward if I'd been a fan,' she said. 'I was around 15 when I realized he was inescapable. Even if I was in a car and had the radio on, there's my dad. He's larger than life, and our culture is obsessed with dead musicians. We love to put them on a pedestal. 'If Kurt had just been another guy who abandoned his family in the most awful way possible . . . But he wasn't. He inspired people to put him on a pedestal, to become St. Kurt. He became even bigger after he died than he was when he was alive. You don't think it could have gotten any bigger. But it did.' In the revealing interview, Frances also divulges why she thought her father shot himself exactly 21 years ago today, aged just 27. 'Kurt got to the point where he eventually had to sacrifice every bit of who he was to his art, because the world demanded it of him. 'I think that was one of the main triggers as to why he felt he didn't want to be here and everyone would be happier without him. Left behind: Frances and her mother Courtney Love at the January premiere of documentary film Kurt Cobain: Montage Of Heck at the Sundance Film Festival . 'There is, with any great artist, a little manic-ness and insanity. So many people are content to settle. 'My dad was exceptionally ambitious. But he had a lot thrown on him, exceeding his ambition. He wanted his band to be successful. But he didn't want to be the f**king voice of a generation. 'In reality, if he had lived, I would have had a dad. And that would have been an incredible experience.' While serving as an executive producer on the acclaimed documentary, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival this year, Frances said she told writer director Brett Morgen she didn't want to focus on the romanticism or mythology of her father. 'Even though Kurt died in the most horrific way possible, there is this mythology and romanticism that surrounds him, because he's 27 forever,' she said. 'The shelf life of an artist or musician isn't particularly long. Kurt has gotten to icon status because he will never age. He will always be that relevant in that time and always be beautiful. Too soon: Cobain was found shot dead in his home in Seattle exactly 21 years ago on Wednesday, aged just 27 . The visual artist also revealed that her fathers ex bandmates Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic and Pat Smear get the 'K.C. Jeebies' when they see her, partially because she sounds just like Kurt. 'His speaking voice is sort of similar to mine. It's sort of a monotone,' she said. 'The depth to it is similar to the way I speak. I don't know what the f**k that is. I wasn't even talking when he was around. 'It's very weird how genes are. Dave, Krist and Pat came over to a house where I was living. It was the first time they had been together in a long time. And they had what I call the ""K. C. Jeebies,"" which is when they see me, they see Kurt. They look at me, and you can see they're looking at a ghost. They were all getting the K. C. Jeebies hardcore. 'Dave said, ""She is so much like Kurt."" They were all talking amongst themselves, rehashing old stories I'd heard a million times. I was sitting in a chair, chain-smoking, looking down like this,' she said, pretending to look bored. 'And they went, ""You are doing exactly what your father would have done."" 'But I was glad they came over,' she smiled. 'It was a cool experience, like having a Nirvana reunion minus one. Except for his spawn.' Frances also said of her dad's relationship with her mother Courtney Love: 'I always knew that their relationship was toxic. And I don’t promote having a fix-it baby, which is what I was - to fix their problems. 'But I know from the video footage and letters that I have that Kurt wrote me... my dad did love me.' Spooky: The visual artist said she gave Kurt's ex Nirvana bandmates the 'KC Jeebies' when they see her, because they are 'looking at a ghost'"
"The Shrimps lost their opening game of the season at newly-promoted Grimsby but then knocked Championship side Rotherham out of the EFL Cup 5-4 and have won three straight league games.
""It's nice but it is early days,"" 40-year-old Bentley told BBC Radio Lancashire.
""You're never too high and never too low and I keep saying that.""
He added: ""It's important everyone keeps their feet on the ground - likewise when you have a sticky spell that everyone keeps check and sticks together.""
Kevin Ellison, 37, got the only goal of the game as Morecambe's 1-0 win at Yeovil on Saturday moved them to the top of the league.
""People say about his age and this and that but if you work with him day in, day out you see how he rubs off on other people,"" added Bentley on Ellison. ""His desire, his attitude towards training and his own recovery and own professionalism, he's a credit to himself and his family.
""A lot of young people should look at him up and down the country because he is that good at what he does."""
"No one would talk about Bruce Jenner's Friday tell-all interview with Diane Sawyer - not ex Kris, nor his daughters Kendall and Kylie or even Khloe and Kourtney - when they stopped by Craig's in West Hollywood on Thursday evening.

Bruce pre-Kris in 1989: On Thursday evening Entertainment Tonight reported that Jenner started a gender transition process in the mid-1980s but stopped after he met and fell in love with Kris Kardashian, who became his third wife . She insisted the entire clan is fully supportive of Jenner. She added: 'As a family we always support each other 100 per cent and I know that I see things online that there is this divide and this one doesn’t support this and this one doesn’t support this and you know it’s all ridiculous and it’s all rumors and we love everyone in the family and we support everyone equally so we're excited to watch tonight and I’m excited for Bruce to tell his story on Diane Sawyer.' She added to Entertainment Tonight: 'I hate so badly when I see things [like] my mom doesn't support him, or this sister doesn't support him. It's all just a story that people want to put out there. None of us have spoken and we're letting Bruce speak first.' TMZ claimed that Bruce, 65, would be watching the special twice. 'He will be watching both an east coast and west coast feed,' said a source. 'The Kardashian family will be watching one feed with Bruce, and the rest of his family, including Brody, Brandon, Burt and Casey, will be watching the other feed.' The Jenners will gather at his Malibu mansion. The site's source added, 'Bruce felt it was very important to be around his family when the show airs.' The cameras for Keeping Up with the Kardashians will not be on when he watched the show, it was also claimed. But there was no mention if some of Bruce's own cameras for one of his own projects would be there. On Thursday evening Entertainment Tonight reported that Jenner started a gender transition process in the mid-1980s but stopped after he met and fell in love with Kris Kardashian, who became his third wife. A supporter: The E! queen previously told Entertainment Tonight. 'I think Bruce is very happy, the happiest I've ever seen him...He's our dad so we support him no matter what… I guess I'll kind of let everyone be curious and I feel like that's his journey to talk about' By the mid-1980s, the Olympic gold medalist had allegedly started hormone therapy and electrolysis and had had plastic surgery to make his features look more feminine. Jenner found his own facial hair to be repulsive, the source told ET. A spokesperson for Bruce declined to comment on the report after being contacted by DailyMail.com Friday morning. The bombshell Entertainment Tonight report, broadcast Thursday night, claims that Bruce was exploring the idea of gender reassignment surgery with doctors in Denmark but had a change of heart after meeting Kris, the ex-wife of famed LA attorney Robert Kardashian. Mum's the word on her ex: Kris Jenner would not comment on Bruce's upcoming tell-all when she stopped by Craig's in West Hollywood on Thursday evening . The revelation comes just hours before the famous decathlete and reality star is expected to tell all about his personal journey and his transition to living as a woman in a two-hour ABC special tonight with Diane Sawyer. On Friday morning ABC released another clip from his upcoming sit down. In the emotional video, Sawyer asked Jenner if there was anything that they hadn't covered over the course of the interview. 'What is the question—if I were you, what question would you ask me?' he clarified. 'Right...""Are you going to be OK? You know? Are you gonna be OK?""' Not a peep from this trip either: Khloe Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner had nothing to say about the former Olympian when they attended the Calvin Klein Jeans' celebration launch of the #mycalvins Denim Series at Chateau Marmont Thursday . He then said, 'Yeah. I hope I'm gonna be OK. I feel like I'm gonna be OK...2015's gonna be quite a ride. Quite a ride.' Earlier Bruce said he was worried about his children. 'I can't let myself hurt them.' Kim earlier showed support for her stepfather when talking to Entertainment Tonight. 'I will say that I think Bruce should tell his story his way...I think everyone goes through things in life,' she explained. 'I think Bruce is very happy, the happiest I've ever seen him...He's our dad so we support him no matter what… I guess I'll kind of let everyone be curious and I feel like that's his journey to talk about.'

"A married Mormon elementary school teacher had a sexual relationship with one of his 12-year-old students - and was only stopped when her classmates told other teachers, police have revealed. Kenne Worthen, 27, allegedly started flirting with the sixth grader at Longview Elementary School in Phoenix last August and the relationship turned sexual in January, Fox10 reported. The father-of-one allegedly kept in contact with the girl outside school by messaging her on an iPod app, Google Hangouts, where she labeled his profile with a fake name, 'Jesse Smith'. Some of the conversations were sexual in nature, according to police, while in another, the teacher told the student he was worried she would feel guilty and tell his wife or the police. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Kenne Worthen, pictured left in his mug shot and right in his teacher's headshot, was arrested on Friday after it emerged that he allegedly had a sexual relationship with one of his 12-year-old students . Earlier this year, he allegedly asked her mother if the girl could stay behind after class. On April 10, they had sexual contact at the school, the girl told police. 'He contacted my daughter's mother and said, ""Can she stay after school and help with something?"" and mom said, ""Of course, why not?""' the girl's enraged father told Fox10. 'There should've been no reason why my child was in a classroom alone with a teacher.' The father, who has not been identified, called the alleged relationship 'sickening' but applauded his daughter's fellow students, who told another staff member last Friday that they thought Worthen and the student were having inappropriate contact. 'I honestly couldn't thank them enough for what they've done for my daughter in this case, because who knows how much longer this would have gone on had they not said anything,' he said. After the students told staff, they called the police, according to a statement from the school district. When asked about the relationship, the girl initially denied it but later admitted to it, according to KPHO. Family: 27-year-old Worthen is pictured with his wife Danielle and their two-year-old daughter . 'Fears': In messages to the girl, he allegedly expressed fears she would tell his wife about the relationship . 'Sick': He allegedly kept in contact with the girl outside of school by messaging her on an iPod app . Worthen, who has no criminal record, also allegedly admitted to having sexual contact with the girl after contacting her over the internet. He was arrested at the school on Friday afternoon and is facing charges of luring a minor for sexual exploitation, child molestation and sexual conduct with a minor. He has been denied bond. On Monday, Osborn School District Superintendent Patricia Tate sent a letter to parents about the incident. 'He has been put on administrative leave and will not be returning to Longview,' the letter read. 'If anyone has information or questions specific to this case, please contact the Phoenix Police Department at 602-262-6151. The safety of your children is and always will be our first priority.' Police said they do not believe there are other victims. Speaking to Fox10, the girl's father said he was overwhelmed with anger towards Worthen. 'You have this anger, the anger towards the perpetrator, and a feeling that you physically want to harm that person,' he said. 'Then there's an anger at least for me towards the school, because you send your child there thinking they're going to be safe.' In court: Following his arrest on Friday, the teacher appeared in court (pictured) but was denied bond . Scene: Worthen, who has worked at the school (pictured) for two years, allegedly had sexual contact with her there on April 10 after getting her mother's permission to let the girl stay late after school . Worthen has taught sixth grade at the school for nearly two years. He is also an International Pathway Adjunct Professor at Brigham Young University-Idaho, where he teaches life skills and English to international students, according to his Linkedin page. 'Mr. Worthen was employed by the university as an online adjunct instructor,' a university spokesperson told DailyMail.com. 'However, his employment was terminated as soon as the university was made aware of his arrest.' He has also previously held after-school teacher roles in Idaho and volunteered as a Boy Scuots supervisor, according to his Linkedin page. The profile also suggests he is a follower of the Church of Latter-Day Saints. His wife, Danielle, also lists herself as a Mormon online. They have a two-year-old daughter together.

"Unsurprisingly, the Champions League  and Europa League draws have dominated the headlines on the Continent - especially in Spain and Italy who make up six of the last eight teams remaining in both European competitions. In Italy, Juventus' semi-final with Real Madrid has been likened to a pair of films with Tuttosport comparing the clash to 'Star Wars' complete with Cristiano Ronaldo and Mauro Icardi brandishing lightsabers, while Corriere dello Sport confidently claim it's 'Mission Possible'. La Gazetta dello Sport are equally bold in their conviction that the Old Lady can overcome the holders and have even mapped out how the tie can be won, which seems to pin hopes on former Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez. Film themes have been used to brand the Champions League semi-final between Real Madrid and Juventus . La Gazzetta dello Sport pins Juve's hopes of reaching the Champions League final on Carlos Tevez . Italians have a plan to beat the holders while Spain is holding out for a Clasico final . Bernabeu boss Carlo Ancelotti apparently fears hos former team since: 'They've won the Scudetto and can now focus only on Europe'. And, former Liverpool and Chelsea manager Rafa Benitez is being equally cautious over his Napoli side's chances of beating Europa League minnows Dnipro, warning: 'They are a good side'. With Fiorentina facing holders Sevilla in the second semi-final, there is hope that the final will be contested between two Serie A teams.

"A woman who tipped the scales at almost 20st has shed nearly half her body weight after she was forced to stand during an 11-hour flight - because she feared she was crushing the woman in the seat next to her. Sharon Smith, 43, from Halesowen, West Midlands, was a bulky size 26 when she went on the business trip in December 2012 and struggled to fit in the plane seat. Today she weighs in at a healthy 9st 9lb and is due to run a 10k race on Sunday, when two years she would have struggled to walk half a mile, let alone run six. Scroll down for video .

Sharon said she lost 4st through joining a slimming club but then shed another four-and-a-half stone after taking up her sporty hobby.

After six months of following the plan, she was 18st 6lb so estimates that when she started she was 'way over 20st' and a size 26.

Sharon said: 'I was never one of those people who was okay being big, it had always upset me but my head wasn't in the right place to do anything about it because I had a busy working life.' She put her unhealthy lifestyle down to commuting to London for her job as a children's clothes designer for Aquascutum which saw her do minimal exercise. At her heaviest Sharon was over 20st and a size 26 but she has now slimmed down to 9st 9lbs and is a size 10 . But the turning point came for Sharon after having to 'squeeze' her bulky frame into seats on trains and planes. 'I started commuting to London in August 2012 and the business trip to Hong Kong was in December that year,' she said. 'I had been travelling out there for ten years but luckily I had always managed to upgrade or have no one in the seat next to me. 'But this trip coming back I was in economy and it is the one that really sticks out in my memory. 'I remember being rammed in my seat with a lady next to me. I felt uncomfortable not just for me but for her too. Sharon says her weight was down to to commuting to London for her job as a clothes designer but after quitting her job to go freelance and work from home, Sharon was able to exercise at lunch . 'I ended up standing for the entire flight with my iPod in. 'I was genuinely worried I might hurt the woman in the next seat because of my weight. She didn't say anything but I just didn't think it fair for her to suffer because of my size. 'The flight attendant even offered me the seats they use for take-off and landing. But with the big long-haul jets there is more room to stand.' But even back in the UK, she was fed-up of the daily humiliation of her long journeys to work. She said; 'On top of this, every time I went to London I was fed up having to squeeze into train seats.' Sharon made small changes to her lifestyle, such as walking around London rather than taking the Tube, and in January 2014, she decided to quit her high-flying job and go freelance. She began working from her home which meant she could go for a walk every lunchtime. Sharon took up running last March and by now was around 13st to 14st and finding it difficult to lose any more weight. Friends were talking about the 'Couch to 5k' beginners running programme so she started doing that and signed up for a 5k Race for Life, which she did last July in an impressive 40 minutes. After getting a taste for activity Sharon joined a runners' website, The Running Bug, which 'changed her life' as she was egged on by other enthusiasts. Sharon added: 'The site, especially the members' forum, gave me so many tips and so much encouragement.' Sharon took part in a 5k Race for Life which she completed in just 40 minutes . The designer has since completed two 10k runs last year and even ran the Brighton half marathon in two hours and 59 seconds in February this year. Sharon, who is also running the Morrisons Great Birmingham 10k run this Sunday, added: 'The weight loss really picked up when I started running, it really helped with the momentum. 'Once I started training for my first 10k race last summer, the pounds really dropped off. 'I think it was a mix of things that caused the problems, I knew my diet wasn't healthy. 'At the weekends I tended to graze the whole day through so there wouldn't be that many minutes when I wasn't eating, it was constantly chocolate and crisps. 'Now I don't buy any processed foods, I don't even buy ready-made bread and I try to make everything from scratch. 'I eat a lot more fruit and veg and try to eat health fats like nuts.'"
"An angry neighbour who stormed onto the catwalk at Sydney's Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week while fashion designer Kym Ellery was taking her bow has compared the noise being made at the event to a jumbo jet. Maurice Thibaux, 67, caused quite a stir at Sunday night's opening show held at the Carriageworks in Eveleigh - in Sydney's inner city. The French native - who lives next door to the venue - crashed the stage to make a complaint about the noise, which he claims was 'similar to a jumbo jet taking off over your head'. Scroll down for video . Maurice Thibaux stormed the catwalk at Sydney's Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week on Sunday night at the Carriageworks . Mr Thibaux said he had no problem with the music but the rumbling that came with it. 'I was watching TV and I use headphones, which are noise cancelling, so normally it cuts out all the noise. In fact I can't even hear the telephone,' he told 9News. 'I could hear a rumble... so I took of my headphones and the rumble continued. It felt like the house was shaking.' Mr Thibaux said he did not even know he was walking into a fashion week event because the bright lights obstructed his vision. Mr Thibaux, who lives next door to the Carriageworks, points at where the fashion show was taking place at the Eveleigh venue . The 67-year-old French native said he had no problem with the music but the rumble that accompanied it . 'I had no idea where I was to be honest. I could have been on the moon. It's embarrassing,' he said. The 67-year-old said he was 'very sorry' to have disturbed the show, which finished at 7pm. But he was not the only neighbour of the Carriageworks that found the noise disturbing. Jane Houselander said she did not sleep on Sunday night and neither did her neighbour who was 'incredibly upset' and 'very anxious'. Footage of the incident shows Mr Thibaux storming the stage with his hands over his ears, wagging his finger and shouting at a security guard who escorted him from the runway. He claims the noise was as loud as a jumbo jet flying overhead and was trying to make a complaint about it . Sunday night marked the start of Sydney's Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. This photo is from the Ellery show . Mr Thibaux was eventually escorted off the catwalk by a security guard at the Carriageworks . Hardcore electronic music with a heavy bass line boomed throughout the space for the duration of the show, which lasted about 15 minutes. He was overheard complaining that show organisers were showing little respect for the local community. 'The noise is way too loud, this is disgrace,' eye witnesses overheard him say, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. 'It was loud but it was all part of the dramatic vibe,' a guest at the Ellery show told Daily Mail Australia. The Australian designer was not fazed by the disruption, the eye-witness added. 'Kym ran out merrily at the end, aside from that it all went perfectly,' they said. Mr Thibaux took to the stage while Australian fashion designer Kym Ellery was taking her bow after the Sunday show . Ellery seemed unfazed by the incident and continued to do her lap of honour down the runway ."
"The broccoli chemical sulforaphane is known to block the inflammation and damage to cartilage associated with arthritis (file picture) An artificial version of a compound in broccoli could hold the key to treating arthritis, say researchers. The broccoli chemical sulforaphane is known to block the inflammation and damage to cartilage associated with the condition. But patients would have to eat several pounds of the vegetable every day to derive any significant benefit. Sulforaphane in its natural form is also too unstable to turn into a medicine. But UK drug company Evgen Pharma has developed a stable synthetic version of the chemical that offers the potential of a pill treatment. A single dose of the drug, known as Sulforadex or SFX-01, is the equivalent of eating 5.5lb of broccoli in one day. In tests on mice affected by osteoarthritis, Sulforadex significantly improved bone architecture, gait balance and movement. Professor Andrew Pitsillides, who co-led the research at the Royal Veterinary College in London, said: ‘These initial results are very positive for such an experiment and we have convinced ourselves that sulforaphane is a promising agent for the treatment of osteoarthritis. ‘The clinical development of sulforaphane has been held back by the fact that it is inherently unstable – SFX-01 is a major advance in this area.’ Professor Pitsillides added: ‘Nearly nine million people in the UK have osteoarthritis and it costs the NHS more than £5 billion every year. But UK drug company Evgen Pharma has developed a stable synthetic version of the chemical that offers the potential of a pill treatment (file picture) 'There is no cure or effective treatment for the disease other than pain relief or joint replacement, so the potential for SFX-01 is massive.’ Broccoli is also believed to reduce the risk of some cancers and cardiovascular disease, and improve symptoms of autism. A University of Pittsburgh study found it could be used to prevent throat cancer. In laboratory tests, extracts from broccoli were shown to give mice protection against oral cancer."
"A New York City cop checking in on his elderly parents on Friday was horrified to discover them dead along with two other guests in their home. Robert Hugel, who is assigned to the Technical Assistance Response Unit, found the victims, all in their 70s and 80s, just after 3 p.m. at the house in Bellerose in Floral Park, Queens. The New York Post reports that Jerry Hugel, 83, his wife Marianne Hugel, 80, died along with 70-year-old neighbor Gloria Greco, and friend Walter Vondthadden, 76, in an apparent carbon monoxide poisoning, possibly caused by a car left running in a garage. Scroll down for video . Married 60 years: Neighbors say that Jerry and Marrianne Hugel were a happily married couple for 60 years who loved to dance, garden, and observe their German heritage . Cleaning up: Police Department personnel remove one of the bodies from a home where four people were found dead on Friday . It appeared the car was accidentally left running in the garage, but it was unclear for how long, investigators said. Neighbors lined the streets and sidewalks in the suburban neighborhood next to Long Island's Nassau County. Some cried as police officers and firefighters walked around the Cape Cod-style, two-story home. Before police officially identified the victims, neighbor Helga Harter told The Associated Press that the couple was named Jerry Hugel and Marie Hugel, who were in their 80s and had known her for 40 years. 'They were wonderful people,' Harter said through tears as she stood on a street corner, looking at the home. 'They were married for 60 years.' Heartbroken son: Robert Hugel was checking in on his elderly parents on Friday when he found them dead due to apparent carbon monoxide poisoning along with two of their friends . Medical aid: Emergency personnel gather near a home where police say four people were poisoned to death . The Hugels had five children, including son Robert Hugel, a New York Police Department officer who was said to have found his parents lifeless bodies. She described them as a 'great family' very active in the local German community. She last saw them on Wednesday at a Bavarian dancing class they attended together. 'I'm in shock,' Harter said. 'It's the greatest shock of my life.' The Hugels had lived in the home for 40 years, and an elderly woman lived upstairs as their tenant, Harter said. No visible trauma was observed on the victims' bodies, police said. Carbon monoxide, an odorless and colorless gas, is created when some fuels are burned. Hugel was found in the seat of his car in the garage and his wife was found in the room directly next to the garage, reports The New York Post. The scene:  Police stand outside the floral park home where four elderly people were found dead and where to windows are now wide open in an attempt to ventilate the apparent fume filled house . The couple’s friend, age 73, had been seated in the living room and the tenant, who sources said was older than 60, was found on the second floor at the top of the stairs. Neighbors were heartbroken after hearing about the deaths. 'It looks like it was accident, someone just forgot to turn the car off,' a source told The New York Daily News. 'The windows were air-tight, so there was nowhere for the gas to go.' 'It is very surreal,' said Barbara Stoja. 'We knew them for over 35 years. They were very fun people, they were dancers.' 'This is something you see on TV. It is so sad we all know each other to know he is not going to be there anymore.' Stoja said that Jerry Hugel was an avid gardener. 'He was just talking to my husband about planting tomatoes,' she said. Open windows: The four elderly people who died are thought to have been killed by carbon monoxide poisoning and police opened the windows of their home in an attempt to ventilate it . Stunned: Bystanders surround the Floral Park, Queens home where four elderly people died . 'He and my husband compare gardens all the time.' Neighbor Melissa O'Reilly said that the Hugels were avid dancers who loved their German heritage. 'They were such nice people, it’s really sad,' said Melissa O'Reilly, whose parents have lived on the block for three decades. 'They are a really nice family, everyone loves them, just good people, their kids are very nice.' O'Reilly said she knew the family for about 30 years. 'I grew up here, we always called them Mr. and Mrs. Hugel,' O’Reilly said. 'They have lived in that house before my parents moved here, and that was 30 years ago.' The deaths come on the heels of other deadly carbon monoxide incidents that killed at least 10 people on the Eastern Seaboard in recent weeks. A man and his seven children were found dead Monday in a home in Princess Anne, Maryland, where they apparently were poisoned in their sleep while running a generator after a utility cut power to their home on the state's Eastern Shore. The utility, Delmarva Power, said it cut off electricity for safety reasons on March 25, although relatives said the family was behind on its power bills. The family was last seen alive March 28. Saddened: Bystanders gather at the scene where four people were found dead on  Friday, April 10 . On Wednesday, a woman and her 7-year-old daughter were found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in their home in East Orange, New Jersey. Prosecutors said a utility company had shut off power at the home on Tuesday and a gas generator was being used there without proper ventilation. There was an inoperable carbon monoxide detector in that home, they said. City Councilman Mark Weprin, who represents the area including Floral Park, said he hoped the tragedy would shed light on the importance of having and maintaining carbon monoxide detectors in all homes and apartments. 'My thoughts and prayers go out to the friends and families of the victims,'  he said in an emailed statement. Shaken: Neighbors gather at the scene where four people died due to apparent carbon monoxide poisoning ."
"Laos is a popular tourist destination known for its beautiful scenery and ornate temples, however not many people venture below the surface and discover that what is underground is perhaps even more spectacular. The wondrous Tham Khoun Ex caves are so exquisite they don't look real at first, which is perhaps why locals believe that spirits inhabit the underground wonderland. Cave photographer, John Spies, 59, captured the sheer magnificence of the vast, yet intricate, underground wonderland. Enormous banks of terraced flowstone decorate the walls of the cave in many places. This slowly growing mound of white and orange calcite is one of the larger deposits along the river passage . Rippling reflections: A blue-tinted glow from outside illuminates the entrance chamber of the cave . Not your usual day out! Floating on clear deep water and reflections near the cave entrance, visitors can either bring their own kayaks or rent boats from the local community to paddle deep inside the cave and marvel at its wonders . Tham Khoun Ex caves, commonly known as Xe Bang Fai River caves, feature imposing stalagmitemade of mineral deposits. With over 15km (nine miles) of awe-inspiring passages and wide expanses of water, it really is one of Laos' hidden treasures. There is even a vibrant forest thriving at the upstream entrance to the caves, the lush green colour contrasting with the  enormous white and orange banks of terraces flowstone that decorates the walls. Visitors are able to kayak through the waters, or explore adjacent chambers on foot. The cave is only able to be safely accessed during the dry season from November to April and during this time the water is clear and deep with a rich green hue. For some of the grander shots, a team of four equipped with powerful LED lights and walkie-talkies helped to light-paint this enormous cavern for this long exposure shot. In 2008, an expedition, co-led by veteran caver John Pollack lead to the mysterious  caves being mapped and photographed for the first time. What the explorers discovered about the little-known cavern was a vast river cave, which means a cavern with an active water source flowing through it. 'Everything about the cave is big-from its towering entrances to its phobia-inducing spiders, which can be 10inches across,' Pollack told National Geographic. Nature at its best! The upstream inflow entrance of Tham Khoun Xe has a verdant forest inside a huge collapsed doline. It is possible to kayak from the resurgence to here and back in one full day . Hidden secrets! Massive formations abound in a newly discovered fossil section of the cave, 50 metres above the river level. This section, encrusted with delicate formations and not yet open to tourists, is one of several higher passages that lead to jungle shrouded entrances on . Gigantic! The Giant Gour in the Oxbow area of the cave is 60 metres long and is probably one of the worldís largest rimstone basins . American cave explorer Dave Pierce marvels at giant cave pearls which grow like pearls in an oyster with concentric layers of calcite slowly building up year after year . Lit up!

In the dry season from November to April, the only part of the year safe to visit the cave, the water is clear and deep with a rich green hue . This gigantic section, is also not yet open to tourists, is one of several higher passages that lead to jungle shrouded entrances . The Giant Gour in the Oxbow area of the cave is 196 feet long and is probably one of the world's largest rimstone basins. The pool is filled with water during the wet season. The rims of basins like this grow taller each year as calcite precipitates from cave water as it flows faster over protrusions .

"The government said it wanted to ensure that militants with dual nationality who were fighting overseas could not return to Australia.
The laws would also strip citizenship from dual nationals who engaged in terrorism inside Australia.
The government said changes to the Australian Citizenship Act would be introduced to parliament on Wednesday.
The new laws could be applied to up to half of the 120 Australians fighting in the Middle East with Islamic State (IS), said Prime Minister Tony Abbott.
""The legislation will update the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 to ensure dual nationals who serve or fight for terrorist groups, or engage in terrorism-related conduct inspired by terrorists groups, automatically lose their Australian citizenship,"" Mr Abbott said in a statement released on Tuesday.
""The Act will also be amended to ensure dual nationals who are convicted of specified terrorism-related offences automatically lose their Australian citizenship,"" he said.
Last month, the government said it would give the immigration minister the power to revoke citizenship in regards to terrorism activities but that option was attacked as unconstitutional by many legal experts.
Mr Abbott said on Monday the new laws would not leave anyone stateless and did not exclude the role of the courts.
""This will enable a person who has lost his or her citizenship to seek legal redress,"" Mr Abbott said.
""If you are convicted of a terrorist offence, again, there will be an assumption that your Australian citizenship is forfeited, should you be a dual national.""
Parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security will examine whether the law should be allowed to operate retrospectively.
""Given that we have a number of dual citizens currently in jail after terrorist convictions, the committee should consider whether it should have retrospective operation at least in those cases,"" said Mr Abbott.
He said another review would consider what to do with people engaged in terrorism who were solely Australian nationals."
"They've steamrolled past top-four rivals Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City in their current six-game Premier League winning streak, and Manchester United are looking to make it seventh heaven when they travel to table-toppers Chelsea on Saturday. Ahead of the blockbuster clash at Stamford Bridge, the United squad were pictured travelling down to London on Friday afternoon. Led by captain Wayne Rooney the Red Devils' contingent commuted via Stockport Railway Station to the English capital. Wayne Rooney (left) and Ashley Young were among the Manchester United stars who made the trip to London via train on Friday ahead of this weekend's Premier League clash at Chelsea . Radamel Falcao (left) or Robin van Persie (right) could start up front for United vs Chelsea on Saturday . United boss Louis van Gaal  faces a number of selection dilemmas ahead of their clash against the Blues . It was earlier revealed that the 29-year-old striker may have to revert to a midfield role against the Blues after Michael Carrick and Daley Blind were two of four  United players ruled out of the clash due to injury. However, Van Gaal is able to call upon the services of in-form midfielder Juan Mata who is returning to the home of his former club for the first time on Saturday. Mata, who won three trophies in two-and-a-half successful seasons at the Bridge, posted a picture via his Instagram account as the United players boarded the train on Friday afternoon. Accompanied with the caption: 'I got back to London a few times, but this one it's different... Big game, lots of memories, great day of football!... #CFC vs #MUFC' United's No 8 was all smiles as he gears up for what promises to be emotional return to west London. Alongside the injuries of Carrick and Blind, United duo Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo were also absent from the train ride - with the quartet all suffering injuries following United's 4-2 win over bitter rivals Manchester City on April 12. The club's injury setback means that Luke Shaw and Radamel Falcao could both be recalled against Jose Mourinho’s side. And the latter was all smiles alongside Victor Valdes as they travelled down to London on Friday. Falcao is one of several selection dilemmas that Van Gaal and assistant boss Ryan Giggs have to make for the trip against Chelsea; in what the Dutchman described  as ‘the worst scenario’. Michael Carrick (left) limped off against Manchester City while Marcos Rojo picked up an injury soon after . Van Gaal also revealed in his pre-match press conference that Daley Blind (left) and Phil Jones are out . Rooney (right) has impressed up front in recent weeks but may have to drop further back into midfield . Van Gaal (left) puts his arm round Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney during training this week . Van Gaal (left) has revealed that Rooney may play in holding midfield role against Chelsea . 4-1-4-1: De Gea; Valencia, Smalling, Blackett, Shaw; Rooney; Mata, Herrera, Fellaini, Young; Falcao . ‘I have to tell that we have four injuries who played the last match so that’s not so good for us,’ said Van Gaal. ‘We had very good hope that we should recover two of the four but it’s not like that. Carrick is out and Rojo is out, but also Blind and Jones,' the 63-year-old said at United's pre-match press conference on Friday. ‘That’s the worst scenario because Rojo and Jones are good players at the left central defender position. Evans is suspended so we don’t have many choices. Blind and Carrick could play the midfield holding position and I don’t have any other option, or I have to play Wayne Rooney in that position again. I have to puzzle a lot for tomorrow. ‘Other players can take profit of the momentum now. It’s always like that. It’s not special in the life of a manager or a team. ‘You have seen that I took Jones off pitch (against Manchester City) because of injury, you have seen that Carrick was off the pitch, you have seen the tackle of Kompany against Blind. Only Rojo is a little bit surprising because he felt it the day after the match. ‘It’s because of the distance between the matches. Blind and Jones were very close to playing but it was not enough. ‘Other players can take profit of the moment now. It’s always like that. It’s not special in the life of a manager or a team.’ Van Gaal addresses the media ahead of Man United's crucial Premier League clash with Chelsea on Saturday . Luke Shaw hasn't featured under Van Gaal recently but should return to play at left back . Mata (right) is closed down by his Man United team-mates during a training session on Friday . Maroaune Fellaini will be hoping to continue his impressive form against Chelsea on Saturday evening . Fellaini (centre right) is embraced by his team-mates after scoring against rivals Manchester City last week . Sports analysts BSports predict that a Chelsea win is easily the most likely outcome at Stamford Bridge . Asked if Shaw could return for the first time since being substituted in the FA Cup defeat to Arsenal last month amid concerns over his fitness, Van Gaal replied: ‘Maybe you shall see tomorrow [Saturday]. You never know. Luke is fit enough I think. He has already had more than four or five weeks with no match and I don’t like that. But we train and I think he is fit enough.’ With Chelsea holding an eight-point lead and a game in hand over third-placed United, Van Gaal believes it is asking too much for his team to win the title. He also claimed that Mourinho will be happy with a draw. ‘It’s still possible, I’ve said that before,’ he added. ‘It is not logical but it is possible. It’s more when and if, and I don’t believe in when and if. I believe in facts. The fact is that we are behind Chelsea. ‘But, alright, we have to play against them and so do Arsenal so we can lay pressure on Chelsea’s shoulders. You never know, you’ve seen it in previous Premier League seasons. So I cannot say it is not possible, but it is not logical. ‘They play at home but I think that Chelsea will be satisfied with a draw. Of course they will want to beat Manchester United and we want to beat them, the question is how long players can play in the discipline. Robin van Persie (back right) has only been training with United for a week but may return to feature . ‘We live for these titles, we are doing this for that. The only satisfaction you have as a manager is when you win a title. When you are second or third you can play Champions League, but a title is more fixed for you and you have your name on it. That’s why managers are fixated on titles. When you reach that goal you are happy. ‘To be involved in the game with young people to reach a goal, that is also a goal of mine. That is why I’m still a manager because I don’t have to work anymore – you can count on that. I like to work with young people and help them in their career.’ Van Gaal gave a young Mourinho his break in coaching at Barcelona. Asked to compare the Portuguese with his current assistant Ryan Giggs, the United boss admitted that he has been surprised by the Old Trafford legend’s work ethic. He said: ‘It’s always difficult. People compare with each other because Jose Mourinho was not the world-class player that Ryan Giggs was. So that’s the same thing with me. I was not as world-class as, for example, Johann Cruyff yet our ambition is maybe then higher. ‘But I have to admit that I could not imagine when I spoke with him (Giggs) in May or June to ask him to be my assistant manager and we spoke about how we saw it, that he works very hard. As an ex-player you are not used to working very hard and he is a very hard worker, and he reads the game very well like Jose. But to manage a group you have to work, and what I can see is that he’s learning quickly.’ Chris Smalling celebrates after netting the fourth goal in the comprehensive victory at Old Trafford ."
"A busy town centre was brought to a standstill this afternoon after a mysterious 15-foot sinkhole opened up in the road without warning - almost swallowing a number of cars in the process. Motorists had to swerve out of the way of the giant hole after it appeared on the residential Earl Street in Northampton at around 2pm, just hours after part of a London pavement collapsed, swallowing a pedestrian. Shocking pictures show the gaping chasm - which was around eight foot (2.4 metres) wide - with a section of surrounding road also looking on the verge of collapse. Scroll down for video . Enormous: The hole opened up on Earl Street, Northampton, at about 2pm on Thursday . Blocked: Police quickly sealed off the road to avoid anyone falling into the hole, which is about eight foot wide . Police quickly closed off Earl Street, causing traffic chaos and leaving locals without water following damage to a water main. A barmaid from the Charles Bradlaugh pub, opposite the hole, who did not wish to be named, said: 'We saw it from inside the pub. 'It was weird. It just collapsed but it gave way really slowly. It was gradual. 'I am not at all sure why it happened. It was really strange.' Eyewitness Matthew Green, 24, was in the pub when he heard a loud bang. He said: 'I was just having a drink with my mate when there was this loud crashing noise. 'I thought there had been an accident but when I went outside, I saw the road had collapsed. 'The hole is massive. It must nearly cover half of the width of the whole road. 'Police were here pretty quick but cars had to swerve out of the way until we went out and stopped them . 'It is incredible. It is like something you would see in a disaster movie.' Gradual: One eyewitness said the road 'gave way really slowly' as people watched on . Unbelievable: Another person watching it collapse was 'like something you would see in a disaster movie' Van driver Chris Williams, 30, who was stuck in the traffic which backed as a result of the hole, added: 'I couldn't believe it. 'There was loads of traffic. It was horrendous. It backed up for a good few miles.' He added: 'It was very inconvenient.' A Northamptonshire Police spokesman said the incident had been handed over to Anglian Water from the Highways Authority and they were no longer involved. An Anglian Water spokesman added: 'We are still working to get the problem resolved. 'We do not yet know what caused it but fortunately nobody was injured. 'There were six properties without water in the area and it could be days or a couple of weeks until the road is reopened.' Coincidence: The five foot wide by two and a half foot long hole which suddenly appeared in London today . Meanwhile, investigations are continuing into how the pavement outside a cafe in Fulham, south-west London, came to collapse at about 8.50am. A woman, said to be in her 40s, had to be hospitalised after she fell through the hole into the basement of a cafe. Passers-by reported hearing a loud scream before the woman fell into the gap and early reports suggested she had been pushing a pram - although it's now thought it was a shopping trolley. Hammersmith & Fulham Council said that it is investigating claims that the cafe owner raised the issue with the council two months ago and the causes of the collapse. A council spokeswoman added: 'The council’s structural engineer has carried out an initial investigation of the basement collapse in North End Road and secured the site. 'The freeholder of the property is legally responsible for the structural integrity of their basement but we are carrying out a full review of what’s happened and will ensure the site is made safe and all necessary actions are taken once we have a full understanding of how this occurred.'"

"Dear Alison
I am compelled to write and seek review of an historic case of rape. Unusually, and contrary to current practice and the ACPO/CPS Guidance on the Investigation and Prosecution of Rape Cases, the investigation into the serious allegations in this case was dropped before the suspect was interviewed.
The elements of lack of freedom and capacity to consent - which may even have triggered the ""no consent"" legal presumption - make the decision highly irregular. This is shocking in itself. It further troubles me that the senior police officer who dropped the case revealed to the victim he apparently took a series of worthless stereotypes and other irrelevant points into consideration. He did this after apparently consulting with an unnamed CPS official. Most of these stereotypes have been blown out of the water in recent months. Or so I thought.
There has been a sea change in the climate surrounding rape, historic cases in particular. Why is it that the tide has not reached this case? I am driven to the unpalatable conclusion that the identity of the alleged perpetrator - Leon Brittan - may in some way have influenced treatment of the case.  I hope I am wrong. But in my view the case demands your personal attention and an immediate review by the CPS Area Head of Sexual Offences.
As you know, I have been working with the Metropolitan police on a number of cases involving sexual crimes over the last 18 months. I have been the recipient of a considerable amount of information from victims directly, much of which I have passed on to the police. You will know that some of this information has already led to arrests. I anticipate that, under your leadership, more work will follow.
I enclose a contemporaneous note written by victim _________ of a rather blunt conversation she had with DCI Settle concerning his decision to drop the case. I invite you to note, in particular, that he told the victim - who had been locked in a flat and tried to escape from the bathroom window:
""There is no evidence he asked you for sex, forced you to have sex, or asked you to take off your clothes, which you did voluntarily""
This was apparently considered to be a fatal deficiency. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the victim has not has this confirmed in writing as promised.
I asked _______ to share her thoughts after her experience of reporting a crime. These are her words:
""My feelings are that I have been brutally misled having been encouraged by the DPP statements to come forward with my historical case following the Savile affair. All the public pronouncements after Savile suggested that these investigations would be treated sensitively, non-judgmentally and in a victim-centric way. I have been interviewed twice in long, harrowing video sessions first by ______ Police, then MPS [Metropolitan Police Service]. I have been encouraged by the MPS to believe that my evidence is both credible and corroborated. I have repeatedly had to relive the most harrowing night of my life, long pushed to the back of my mind. Then, when I had the temerity to question a police decision I have been turned on by a senior police officer, apparently with the support of the CPS. I have been implicitly accused of making an allegation against someone because 'it is all about who he is'. I have been implicitly accused of being a slut because I sat on a bed. These are attitudes that women of my generation associate with the police and prosecution authorities of the sixties and seventies, not an enlightened and publicly accountable twenty- first century service. It was these attitudes that made me think I would get nowhere if I proceeded with the case when the rape happened. It seems nothing has changed"". I have found myself appalled at the conduct of this investigation. I would like to believe that it is not typical of the CPS and Metropolitan police as a whole. However the case raises some very serious questions which are likely to remain unanswered without your attention.
In the light of this, please could you confirm to me that:
Everyone is complicit in the failures of the past. But we have an opportunity now to put matters right. Any attempt to perpetuate a CPS in which a victim's acquiescence in or inability to escape rape is a barrier to prosecution would fail, with grievous consequences, and would be wrong. There is a strong public interest in getting this right.
I have every confidence that your leadership, and personal intervention in this case, will take the CPS in an altogether better direction."
"The Tories could cut child benefit or stop millions of families receiving it, Government chief whip Michael Gove admitted last night. Mr Gove, the former education secretary, said he could not rule out further cuts to child benefit to reduce the deficit. Asked on the BBC's Newsnight if he could confirm that there would be 'no more changes to child benefit', Mr Gove said: 'No I can't say that.' Conservative chief whip Michael Gove admitted the Tories could cut child benefit or stop millions of families receiving it . Mr Gove said the Tories would not cut benefits for the disabled or pensioners – but refused to rule out cuts to child benefit. He said: 'There is a huge amount of welfare spending that can be reduced without having any impact on people who have disabilities. 'We're not going to hit, or take money away from, the disabled. We're going to protect people who are pensioners. What we are going to do.' Mr Gove was asked specifically: 'There will be no more changes to child benefit. Can you say that to us?' He said: 'It's not our policy at the moment. But the thing I would say is that we've succeeded over the course of the last five years, not just in making departmental cuts which I've alluded to, but in making £21billion worth of welfare cuts. All we're asking to do is to do half of that again.' Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said: 'Michael Gove's repeated refusal to rule out child benefit cuts will only add to fears that the Tories have a secret plan to cut support to children. 'The Tories have a £12 billion black hole in their welfare plans it's clear they can't fill without hitting families with children. It's time for the Tories to come clean with the public about their plans to cut child benefit.' The revelation comes after George Osborne last month refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the Conservatives win a second term. Asked on the BBC's Newsnight if he could confirm there will be 'no more changes to child benefit', Mr Gove said: 'No I can't say that' Mr Gove's remarks came after  George Osborne last month refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the Conservatives win a second term . More than a million households lost out when the Coalition announced that families with one parent earning £50,000 would pay tax on child benefit. Earners over £60,000 lost out altogether. The controversial measure, brought in two and a half years ago as part of the Government's austerity programme, was criticised for penalising single-earner families and stay-at-home mothers. It meant anyone earning less than £50,000 – even a couple on £49,000 each - still received the full entitlement of £20.70 a week for the first child, and £13.70 for every subsequent child. Mr Osborne was asked at a briefing in central London on the economy this morning whether he could 'rule out depriving more people of child benefit, like you've already done in this Parliament?' But the Chancellor appeared to leave the door open to further cuts when asked if he would be 'depriving more families' of the payments which are worth more than £1,000 per year. Mr Osborne did not directly answer about reducing the threshold, only saying that child benefit would not be replaced by the new benefits system Universal Credit, which is being rolled out nationally. The respected think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies have suggested that increasing Universal Credit for some families and using it instead of child benefit could save £4.8billion a year. The Chancellor said: 'You can judge us on our record in this Parliament. If we wanted to put child benefit into Universal Credit we would have done it when we set up Universal Credit. 'We've got a track record, we've got a plan based on clear principles of making work pay, sharpening work incentives.' Asked again why he did not rule out any type of child benefit cuts, he said: 'I've given you a very clear answer. We've created a welfare system where child poverty is down, inequality is down, we have a record low number of workless households and what we are doing is creating welfare system where it pays to work and we protect the most vulnerable. 'We are going to carry on doing that in the next Parliament. But we can't do any of these things without economic security and a growing economy.' The Conservatives say they would cut £30billion of spending if they win a second term. Of this £12billion would be slashed from the welfare bill, with the rest from government departments and further cracking down on tax avoidance. While the Prime Minister has given a commitment to protect the state pension, few other savings have been set out apart from reducing the cap on a family's annual benefits from £26,000 to £23,000. It is widely speculated that the Conservatives could restrict child benefit to just two children, to save around £2billion a year."
"Two  Air Force nuclear missile launch officers who are facing drug charges related to ecstasy, cocaine and bath salts now face hearings to determine whether they will be court-martialed. 1st Lt Michael Alonso and 1st Lt Lantz Balthazar have been charged in cases stemming from an investigation that led to the disclosure last year of a separate exam-cheating scandal. One of their fellow missile officers who was a target of the same investigation pleaded guilty to illegal drug use in January and was kicked out of the service, the Air Force said on Friday. 1st Lt Michael Alonso and 1st Lt Lantz Balthazar of Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana have been charged . Alonso and Balthazar are both members of the 12th Missile Squadron at the 341st Missile Wing at the base . Alonso and Balthazar are both members of the 12th Missile Squadron at the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The Malmstrom missile wing operates 150 of the Air Force's 450 Minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. Launch officers are trained to operate ICBMs that are armed with nuclear warheads and are on constant alert for possible launch. Alonso was charged with violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for illegal possession, use and distribution of ecstasy and for 'conspiracy related to the drug offenses', according to Malmstrom spokesman Josh Aycock. Balthazar was charged with illegal possession, use and distribution of ecstasy and cocaine and for conspiracy related to the drug offenses. He also was charged with illegal use of Pentedrone, which Aycock said is commonly called bath salts. Both officers were charged April 17. Malmstrom's missile wing operates 150 of the Air Force's 450 Minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missiles . Aycock said their cases will be reviewed at Article 32 hearings, which are akin to a civilian grand jury proceeding, to determine whether there is enough criminal evidence to warrant a court-martial. The hearings have not been scheduled, Aycock said. Alonso and Balthazar were among three Minuteman 3 launch officers at Malmstrom who were under investigation for illegal drug use. The other, 2nd Lt Nicole Dalmazzi, was charged in December and court-martialed in January. Dalmazzi, a member of the same squadron, pleaded guilty to illegal use of ecstasy and was dismissed from the Air Force and sentenced to a month of confinement in a Montana jail. The Air Force had also charged her with obstructing the Air Force Office of Special Investigations probe by allegedly dyeing her hair to alter the results of hair-follicle drug tests, but that charge was later dropped. The cases at Malmstrom stem from a drug investigation that began in August 2013 at Edwards Air Force Base in California. When investigators examined the cellphones of two airmen at Edwards they found text messages to or from 11 other Air Force officers at several other air bases, including Malmstrom. The messages allegedly detailed specific illegal drug use and led to the discovery that some had also improperly exchanged answers to ICBM launch officer proficiency tests. The ICBM force, which also operates from bases in Wyoming and North Dakota, has been under the public spotlight in recent years for a series of embarrassing missteps related to low morale, disciplinary problems, a lack of resources, training lapses and leadership failures. Last November, then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced plans for top-to-bottom changes in management of nuclear forces and said the Pentagon would spend $8billion to fix it. In testimony to a Senate panel this week, an administration official who headed a detailed review of the nuclear forces for Hagel last year said her group believed that as much as $25billion could be needed to fix an array of problems. 'The problems that we found were worse and they were much more systemic' than expected, Madelyn Creedon said in her testimony Wednesday. Creedon, who was head of the Pentagon's nuclear policy shop at the time and is now principal deputy administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, said her review found morale in the nuclear Air Force was 'not good.' Nuclear missile crews told her they 'felt trapped' in their job. 'They would say, 'Well, I have the nuclear stink on me so I don't have much of a future in the rest of the Air Force,'' she said. The Air Force says it has begun to change that attitude by implementing a range of changes and improvements that are being felt across the force. Launch officers are trained to operate missiles armed with nuclear warheads and are on constant alert ."
"Lewis Hamilton has described his champagne-spraying of a grid girl after the Chinese Grand Prix, which has drawn widespread criticism, as 'a fun thing'. One of the fundamental acts of Formula One has been brought into sharp focus over the past few days following Hamilton's win in Shanghai. In a typical moment of exuberance that comes with a victory for any driver, and following the playing of the national anthems, Hamilton grabbed his bottle of bubbly and for a fleeting moment turned it on grid girl Liu Siying.

Mercedes AMG Petronas's Hamilton (left)  shares a laugh with Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo . Hamilton says he was just acting on his excitement after winning the Chinese Grand Prix . The pictures that followed appeared to show the Shanghai Institute of Visual Art graduate grimacing as the champagne hit the side of her head. The incident drew condemnation from Object, a campaign group against sexism, which condemned Hamilton's behaviour as 'selfish and inconsiderate', and called on him to apologise. Siying, however, has since defended Hamilton, remarking to the Shanghai Daily: 'It lasted for only one or two seconds, and I did not think too much about it at all.' She added: 'I think some foreign media are more sensitive about the topic compared to local media. 'I was just told by my employer to stand on the podium, and that's what I did.' Asked on Thursday about the matter ahead of this weekend's race in Bahrain, Hamilton was relieved to hear Siying's comments.

'Ultimately it was a great weekend, and generally my actions are through excitement. 'This is Formula One - the pinnacle of motor sport - and I'd just won a grand prix for the team. 'You should see it was a kind of a fun thing. I would never ever intend to disrespect or try to embarrass someone like that. 'I don't really know the reasons why people have brought these things up. 'This is a sport so many people love, and the more we show character and fun it reflects how great this sport is, and that's what I try to do.

"After their scrum had won a penalty try, two fine scores from the backs saw Tigers stretch clear in Italy.
Tonga full-back Veainu raced on to Tommy Bell's grubber, before the full-back sent Peter Betham over in the corner to make it 22-3 at the break.
Veainu's solo try earned the bonus before Greg Bateman pin-balled over.
Tongan Veainu may well think he should have had a hat-trick after a spectacular finish in the corner, but the TMO ruled he had knocked on.
In tricky, rain-affected conditions Leicester dominated the opening 40 minutes and with three tries in the bag by the break looked locked on for the bonus point.
But, after Veainu had seen what would have been a superb effort ruled out by the TMO early in the second half, Treviso enjoyed their best spell of the match.
They were on top for 20 minutes, with their scrum finally firing, but could not add to their solitary first-half penalty and Leicester eventually managed to regain control.
An attack from the two-time champions broke down but Veainu - who scored two tries in the World Cup - rescued the ball and beat four men in a confined space with some sizzling footwork to score under the posts.
Replacement hooker Bateman put a gloss on the score as he bounced off several attackers to add a fifth try for Tigers with the last play of the match.
Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill: ""You've got to be satisfied with maximum points from two games and also with not conceding a try.
""The attitude in defence not to let them in even when we were well ahead said a lot for the team.
""Two wins out of two is a good start, we've got to be happy with that. To get two bonus points is important too - every point will count.""

"Four tries and a total of 30 points from goalkicking winger Josh Mantellato broke brave Bradford's hearts as Hull KR avoided a potential Ladbrokes Challenge Cup banana skin with a 50-30 victory at the Odsal Stadium. Rovers twice came came from behind, trailing 12-0 in the early stages to the Kingstone Press Championship heavyweights, before easing clear with five tries in the final 18 minutes. Amid a pulsating and sometimes controversial cup tie, the hosts ultimately had no answer to Italian international Mantellato, whose last three tries came within the space of seven decisive minutes. It was only the East Yorkshire side's second cup tie success since reaching the quarter-finals in 2011 and their first Challenge Cup victory at Bradford since 1926, albeit only the third time the clubs had met in the competition since then. Winger Josh Mantellato scored four tries and kicked 14 points for Hull KR against Bradford Bulls . Having forced several errors from the Super League side in the opening exchanges, it took a fired-up Bulls less than six minutes to go ahead as Adam O'Brien barged his way through and under the posts. Ryan Shaw converted on his way to a tally of five goals. The Bulls struck again when O'Brien and Etu Uaisele put Dale Ferguson over, although Shaw got a fortuitous bounce off the upright in adding the extras this time. Rovers bounced back, capitalising on an unforced error from Shaw to halve the early deficit when winger Mantellato dived over in the corner then converted his own try. Rovers lost forward Greg Burke to a clash of heads midway through the half but they levelled when an Albert Kelly cross-field kick was tapped back by Mantellato for Kris Welham to touchdown with Mantellato again stroking over the extras. A scintillating weaving solo run by Kelly gave the visitors the led for the first time and Mantellato's conversion sent the Robins in at half time with an 18-12 advantage. A minute before the interval the temperature was cranked up a notch when, out of the blue, Rovers Adam Walker launched a blatant punch at O'Brien and was sin-binned, along with the Bulls Adam Sidlow, who also gained a yellow card after following in with his version of justice. Less than a minute into the second half the Bulls gave notice that they were not finished when Danny Addy completed a stirring break from Alex Mellor to score and Shaw levelled matters. The home joy was short-lived as Kieran Dixon broke clear, only to be stopped by a superb tackle from Uaisele, but Graeme Horne then strode through the regrouping defence to edge Rovers in front again. Mantellato's kick bounced back off of the upright and Bradford nearly responded when Uaisele crossed but the final pass was deemed forward. Sidlow and Addy went close and O'Brien was held up before the home crowd were up in arms again as Kevin Larroyer stole the ball from Addy in what looked to many like a two-man tackle and ran unopposed over 25 metres to score a controversial try. Still the Bulls were not finished as O'Brien put Lee Gaskell in for his 11th try of the season and Shaw closed the gap to just four points again. Three minutes later Lucas Walshaw crashed over after innovative work from Paul Clough, Addy and Gaskell and Shaw edged Bradford back in front. But three tries, all from Mantellato, in seven minutes finally quashed the brave Bulls' hopes of an upset. Controversy reined once more as Mantellato gave Rovers the lead again, amid vociferous calls for a forward pass, but there was no doubt when the Italian international raced away for his hat-trick after Shaw fatally allowed a bomb-kick to bounce. Mantellato struck once more before John Boudebza helped raise the half century for Rovers on the hooter."

"Defence minister Mark Lancaster said 12,565 of the homes were ""expected to materialise in this Parliament"".
He acknowledged this would impact on civilian and military staff but provisions were being made, he said.
The sites include an RAF base, barracks, ex-World War Two airfields and a chaplaincy centre.
They also include two golf courses at RAF Henlow and Southwick Park in Hampshire.
Meanwhile, Network Rail has announced it will release land at almost 200 sites for 12,000 new homes by 2020.
This includes 5,000 homes in London, 3,600 homes in Manchester and the north, 1,700 homes in the Midlands and the east of England and 1,400 homes in the south of England.
The 13 military sites that will be sold by the MoD are:
The MoD said the land at Venning and Parsons Barracks are the only sites that will not have housing built on them, as they will be used for commercial development at the request of Telford and Wrekin Council.
Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: ""We are getting rid of land that we don't need to build homes that we do, generating hundreds of millions of pounds in the process.
""Our commitment to protect and increase the budget for our armed forces means that every penny of that will be reinvested into defence, helping to keep Britain safe.""
But shadow defence secretary Clive Lewis said: ""Affordable housing is desperately needed across the UK, particularly by service families, who have seen the cost of their housing go up as conditions get worse.
""So it's disappointing that the MoD has failed to say how many of these potential new homes will be affordable, or how many could be set aside for service personnel.
""In fact, they cannot even reassure us that these sites will be used to build new homes at all,"" he said.
""What we're looking at is the double impact of 18,000 MoD staff losing their jobs and public land potentially being sold on the cheap for developers to profit from,"" a Public and Commercial Services union spokesman said.
""The government must learn from the mistakes of the past and ensure any land sold not only realises its full value, but that house-builders are forced to ensure enough affordable homes are provided.""
In a written statement, Mr Lancaster said consultations will take place over the coming weeks with ""stakeholders"" including trade unions, to determine the future of each site and their occupants.
""The release of land by the MoD has the potential to provide land for new homes and we will continue to engage with impacted local authorities to determine how the department's assessment of housing unit allocation against each site may be considered as part of the authority's Local Plan,"" he said.
""I acknowledge that these moves will have an impact upon civilian and military staff; the department is making arrangements to provide for units and functions based at sites which will not have a future defence requirement.""
An MoD spokeswoman said it was too early to confirm how exactly it would affect staff at the sites, but she said ""the majority"" will be provided for and moved to accommodation elsewhere, for example.
Mr Lancaster said the sales would contribute £225m towards the MoD's £1bn target for land release sales, as set out in its spending review last year.
The release of the sites contributes to the government commitment to provide land for 160,000 homes by 2020, he said.
The 2015 Conservative manifesto pledged that 200,000 quality Starter Homes would be built over the course of the Parliament, reserved for first-time buyers under 40 and sold at 20 % below the market price."
"The video for You're In Love With A Psycho sees band members dancing around a mental institution with presenter Noel Fielding and Taboo actor Stephen Graham.
Mental health campaigners Time to Change said the video played into a ""sad and tired"" stereotype.
The BBC has contacted Kasabian for a response.
The video sees the celebrity stars and Kasabian band members wearing flesh-coloured hospital gowns and taking medication before gathering their fellow residents for an aerobics-inspired dance routine.
Time to Change, a movement trying to change public attitude towards people with mental health problems, said the video - combined with the use of the word psycho - was ""unhelpful"".
Singer Tom Meighan has previously talked about his own mental health. In an interview with Q magazine, he discussed the impact of a friend's death and how he made himself ill.
Director of Time to Change, Sue Baker, said: ""As so many musicians have recently talked openly about their experiences of mental health problems it is disappointing to see this video.
""The use of the word 'psycho' in a song and accompanying music video featuring people pretending to be psychiatric inpatients is unhelpful, damaging and disappointing when society is moving on from this sad and tired stereotype.""
She said while the harm may have been ""unintentional, or misjudged irony"", the video will ""only serve to fuel stigma"".
Ms Baker added: ""If fans think it is OK to call people with mental health problems who have been psychiatric inpatients 'psychos', then we are turning back the tide of progress on public attitudes that are more respectful and less judgemental of people living with mental health problems.
""We are keen to work with the band and the music industry to help shift outdated stereotypes and stigma.""
You're In Love With A Psycho is the first single from Kasabian's forthcoming sixth album, For Crying Out Loud."
"It's been just a few days since Andy Murray tied the knot to his long term girlfriend Kim Sears. But already his mother Judy is hopefully that he will soon take the next step and start a family. The 55-year-old tennis coach told Closer magazine this week: 'I'm really looking forward to being a granny. I've always wanted to have grandchildren, but I had to be patient and let them get married first.' Scroll down for video . Andy Murray's mother Judy has revealed that she can't wait for her son to have children with his new wife Kim Sears . Judy went on to reveal that she wasn't sure when her 27-year-old son would have children but she knows that he wants them. She said that she will take an active part in their lives and that she can't wait to teach them about tennis. Judy also said that following her stint on Strictly Come Dancing last year she taught her tennis champion son some basic dance moves. 'I showed Andy part of the basic steps for the waltz, as he was going to be best man at his friend's wedding. So before his own wedding he already knew some steps and was confident about taking to the dance floor.' Andy and Kim married this weekend at a service in Dunblane Cathedral, with the bride wearing a Jenny Packham dress . The ceremony was followed by a reception at Cromlix House, Murray's luxury hotel near Dunblane . In a later interview on the BBC's One Show Judy spoke about the wedding itself. She said that it was a prouder moment than when Andy won Wimbledon in 2013: 'Yeah, I think so. I mean it was just such a happy family occasion. 'It was the perfect day from start to finish even despite the hailstones and the snowstorms that we had during the course of the morning. It was lovely, just lovely.' Judy continued: 'It really was a perfect day. It was a very, very happy day and I think everybody was very relaxed and very chilled. 'They've been together for a long time so to see them getting married with all their friends and family around them, and in Dunblane, for me that was very, very special to be able to share it with the people in Dunblane who give so much love and support all the time for him. 'They made such a huge effort and so many of them turn out in not great weather and were there for hours.' Andy and Kim married at Dunblane Cathedral with a service led by the Rev Colin Renwick. The British tennis number one sported a blue and green kilt for the occasion while Sussex-born Sears, 27, wore an embroidered Jenny Packham gown with three-quarter-length sleeves and a long veil. Among the guests were Murray's brother Jamie, divorced parents Judy and William, grandparents Shirley and Roy Erskine and former British tennis number one Tim Henman and his wife Lucy. The ceremony was followed by a reception at Cromlix House, Murray's luxury hotel near Dunblane. Judy attended the wedding wearing a smart white dress coat with taupe coloured heels . In a note written to staff at the hotel Kim said: 'Thank you to Graeme and every single one of you at Cromlix who worked so hard to make this weekend the best of our lives – a special place filled with very special people! X' Andy and Kim met at the US Open in 2005 when they were both aged 17, and became engaged in November. They are believed to have asked guests to make a donation to charities rather than buy wedding presents. Before the big day Andy revealed that he was not nervous about the wedding, but he is nervous about having children. He told BBC Sport: 'I am actually not nervous about getting married because we've been together like nine-and-a-half years and we've lived together for six or seven years as well. 'So, I don't think a whole lot's going to change. I kind of feel like we have been married already in terms of the way we spend our lives together and live together. 'I think I will be more nervous about starting a family because that would be more life-changing, in a good way.'"
"The goal is to see if a computer can beat four of the best players in the variant of poker known as no-limit heads-up Texas hold 'em.
In a similar tournament in 2015, the humans won.
The algorithm could be adapted for use in medicine, cybersecurity, business and the military, its creators said.
The matches - dubbed Brains v Artificial Intelligence -  are being held over 20 days at Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh.
The four human players are matched against Libratus, an artificial intelligence program developed at Carnegie Mellon University's (CMU) school of computer science.
It uses algorithms built over 15 million core hours of computation at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Centre to analyse the rules of poker.
Viewers can watch the entire event live on video-streaming games site Twitch, where there will be a stream for each of the human players:
The players are vying for shares of a $200,000 (Â£162,000) prize, while the CMU scientists are hoping to set a new benchmark for artificial intelligence.
""Since the earliest days of AI research, beating top human players has been a powerful measure of progress in the field,"" said Tuomas Sandholm, professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon.
""That was achieved with chess in 1997, with Jeopardy in 2009 and with the board game Go just last year.
""Poker poses a far more difficult challenge than these games, as it requires a machine to make extremely complicated decisions based on incomplete information while contending with bluffs, slow play and other ploys.""
A similar contest in 2015, with a computer program dubbed Claudico, failed to beat the humans, with scientists concluding that the 80,000 hands it had played had proved too few to establish its superiority.
This time around, there will be 120,000 hands.
Claudico also made some obvious bluffs that they had been able to exploit, the players said.
This time around, the AI will be able to bluff with precisely calculated values to balance risk and reward.
It will also be able to deploy random moves in a way that human players would have great difficulty doing.
The scientists hope that it could baffle human opponents, with unusual strategies such as making tiny bets or massive over-bets.
Player Jason Les said of the new contest: ""I'm very excited to see what this latest AI is like.""
""I thought Claudico was tough to play; knowing the resources and the ideas that Dr Sandholm and his team have had available in the 20 months since the first contest, I assume this AI will be even more challenging.""
Solving the complex game of poker had many real-world applications, Dr Sandholm said.
""Extending AI to real-world decision-making, where details are unknown and adversaries are actively revising their strategies, is fundamentally harder than games with perfect information or question-answering systems,"" said Nick Nystrom, senior director of research at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center .
""This is where it really gets interesting."""
"The German shepherd, which belonged to Cleveland Police, was being exercised near to Ormseby Stables in Eston when it bit a 28-year-old man.
The man suffered puncture wounds on his arm and upper body and was taken to hospital. The dog handler also suffered an injury to his arm.
The force has apologised and referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
A police spokesman said: ""Based on an assessment of the animal it has been put to sleep.
""This was not an easy decision for any of the people involved, but has been made in the best interests of all those involved.""
The incident occurred on 6 June.
Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Ciaron Irvine said it would be ""wrong to speculate"" until the full circumstances were known.
""What is clear is that this incident should not have happened and we must absolutely understand what went wrong,"" he added."
"Turner, 32, recently retired after a 15-year career, winning 763 races.
In 2008 she became the first female British jockey to ride 100 UK Flat winners in a year.
""It's nice for the girls putting in the effort and hard work that they can see there's light at the end of the tunnel,"" she told BBC Radio 5 live.
""It shows what they are working hard for is achievable.""
She added: ""It is more difficult for women, they need to train harder because men are physically stronger.""
Turner rode two Group One winners at the highest level in Britain during her career, but suffered a number of injuries.
She credited the support of trainer Michael Bell for giving her the opportunity to race when she was an apprentice.
""I find with my job it has to be all or nothing,"" she added. ""You cannot pick and choose and have the odd day off.
""I have had so many thrills and had fun and loved every minute and feel the time is now right to try something different."""
"It seems in Northern Ireland we call it Tuesday.
Politics dominates the front pages of the papers again today as the clock which was supposed to stop yesterday at 16:00 keeps on ticking.
The Belfast Telegraph seems to have run out of patience and says of stalemate MLAs who failed to secure an agreement: ""Give them three months then stop their pay.""
It quotes a member of the panel that sets MLAs' salaries who says their wages cost the taxpayer £13.5m per year - about the same as the botched Renewable Heating Incentive scheme that brought down the power-sharing executive.
Former Ass Chief Const Alan McQuillan says there would be public fury if MLAs were able to ""sit back and collect pay cheques in the absence of a working executive"".
""The political vacuum means that jobs and public services are under threat in the wider community,"" he says.
""For MLAs to continue merrily on full pay and expenses would anger people who were feeling the pain of the failure to reach a deal.""
Inside, political commentator Malachi O'Doherty says he does not envy the position of Secretary of State James Brokenshire, who is faced with deciding how Northern Ireland moves on from the stalemate.
He says if Mr Brokenshire makes the wrong decision, he could ""leave this place even more divided"".
Also in the Belfast Telegraph, the family of a missing Londonderry man are facing an anxious wait to find out if the body pulled from the River Foyle on Monday was that of the 23-year-old.
Jack Glenn went missing on 2 February after he failed to return home from a night out.
The News Letter leads with its editorial 'Morning View' on the front page, where it is clear on its position with a headline that asserts: ""Sinn Féin holding us all to ransom.""
It asks when London ""will dismiss pressure from Dublin and realise the Sinn Féin, which is not the first choice of 72% of voters, cannot hold Northern Ireland to ransom just because the party doesn't care if the Province fails?""
""London is naturally afraid of a return to violence... but there is only so long you can act timidly due to such fears,"" it reads.
The editorial concludes with a plea to readers not to take its stance as sectarian.
""The News Letter has shown its independence from unionist parties in our relentless scrutiny of RHI,"" it argues.
""Now Northern Ireland faces another governance scandal.
""Regrettably, direct rule is looking to be the best way forward, so that hard decisions can be made free of a Sinn Féin veto.""
News Letter reporter Stephen Gamble took to the streets of Coleraine where he says the people share the paper's view that direct rule is the best option for a way forward.
One individual spoken to by the paper said Northern Ireland was ""constantly lurching from one political crisis to the next"" and rule from London was the ""only option"".
You'll have to reach page 13 of the paper to read its first non-political story of the day: ""Teen scrambler gets 18 months for killing mum,"" reads the headline.
Gary Lewis, 18, was jailed on Monday for causing the death of mum-of-three Valerie Armstrong.
The story also features in the Irish News, which says Lewis ""held Mrs Armstrong's hand and cried uncontrollably as she lay bleeding from fatal injuries"".
It also says the teenager wrote to the victim's family.
On page three of the Irish News, Former Fermanagh and Down GAA player Shane King speaks out about his son's brain injury.
Patrick King, 15, was injured while mountain biking at Kilbroney Park in Rostrevor on Saturday, and has been sedated in intensive care ever since.
Mr King asks people to keep Patrick in their thoughts and prayers as the family keep a bedside vigil."
"Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia put on a united front today, as they stepped out for the first time since explosive new claims about the 47-year-old monarch's father emerged. According to a new book by a former royal correspondent, the former King Juan Carlos II had a long-running affair with a German socialite during the final decade of his reign. But if Felipe and Letizia were upset about the revelations, they certainly weren't showing it as they arrived at the University of Alcala de Henares to present the Cervantes Prize for Literature. Scroll down for video . Claims: King Felipe and Queen Letizia present a united front following the latest Spanish royal scandal . Walking arm-in-arm with his 42-year-old wife, King Felipe, who took the Spanish throne last June, kept a straight face as he approached photographers. Later, as a group of ukulele-wielding students appeared to serenade the royal couple, Felipe even managed a small smile. Well-hidden though any private anguish may have been, the news will have undoubtedly come as a blow to the Spanish royal who has been attempting to overhaul the image of the monarchy in Spain since taking the throne. His father Juan-Carlos was famous for his love of freebies, even, on one occasion, accepting a yacht called Fortuna as a gift. Not good: A new book by journalist Ana Romero (left) says King Juan-Carlos had a decade-long affair . Divorce: It also claimed that Juan-Carlos contemplated divorcing Felipe's mother, Queen Sofia . Unruffled: The Spanish royal couple kept any worries about the allegations under wraps during the visit . Light relief: Felipe managed a small smile while being serenaded by a group of student musicians . In June 2012, with the Spanish economy in crisis and unemployment running at close to 50 per cent among the young, Juan-Carlos was photographed enjoying a lavish hunting safari in Botswana. The trip, which was not announced in advance, only became known to Spanish taxpayers when the 77-year-old was injured and had to charter a special plane in order to get home. Juan-Carlos' African jaunt, a freebie paid for by Syrian businessman Mohamed Eyad Kayali, led to widespread calls for his abdication, which he did less than a year later. Since taking the Spanish throne, Felipe has introduced a new code of conduct  which  bans royals from accepting lavish gifts and also outlaws private business activity - the latter in response to a fraud scandal that  enmeshed his sister Infanta Cristina in 2010. He has also included a stipulation that insists members of the Spanish royal family behave at all times in ways likely to 'please' and 'earn them the gratitude of'  the public. Blow: The  scandal is a set-back for Felipe who has been trying to change public perception of the monarchy . Freebies: Felipe's new rules include banning all royals, among them wife Letizia, from taking freebies . Behaviour: Royals are expected to behave in a way that earns them the gratitude of the Spanish public . Despite Felipe's best efforts, his father's legacy remains troublesome - in particular his record of extramarital affairs. Most recently, a Belgian woman named Ingrid Sartiau filed a paternity suit against him - a case only made possible because of his abdication. Juan-Carlos is also believed to have a second illegitimate son, Alberto Sola who was born in 1956 and lives in Barcelona. The latest scandal focuses on the final decade of his reign with Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, a German 28 years his junior, claiming to have had a lengthy affair with the royal. Speaking to Ana Romero, a former royal correspondent and the author of a new book called Final De Partida [End Game], Ms Sayn-Wittgenstein claimed that Juan-Carlos had contemplated divorcing his wife Queen Sofia in order to marry her."
"Singer Adele Adkins, a mother-of-one, has topped the young music rich list again, earning £5million in the last year, despite releasing no new music . It has been almost four years since her last album but that has not stopped Adele from earning £5million over the last year. Bringing her fortune to a total of £50million, the singer has retained her place at the top of the list of Britain’s richest musicians under the age of 30. The mother-of-one, 26, has double the wealth of her closest rivals – the four members of One Direction and their former compatriot Zayn Malik, 22 - who are worth £25million each. However, the country’s rising stars are hot on the singer’s heels. Ed Sheeran, 24, has enjoyed the year’s biggest rise, with a £13million boost taking his fortune to £20million and moving him from 23rd to seventh on the list. While Sam Smith, 22, is a new entry with £12million, placing him on par with Florence Welch, 28, and the pairing of Arctic Monkey’s guitarist Jamie Cook, 29, with his model wife Katie Downes, 30. Adele, full name is Adele Adkins, faces the toughest female competition from the Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding singer Ellie Goulding, 28, who, alongside Leona Lewis, 30, Jessie J, 27, and Katie Melua, 30, is worth £13million. Having also sung the theme song for the last James Bond instalment Skyfall, Adele’s hotly anticipated but much delayed third album is believed to be set for a release later this year. This is the fourth year in a row Adele has topped the list of the richest young musicians. With such impressive earning power, many of her contemporaries would look to channel their popularity into other lucrative activities. However, the singer has previously ruled that out, telling Vogue: ‘I have absolutely no intention of going into acting or making perfumes. Adele has amassed twice the wealth of her nearest competitors, the four remaining members of One Direction, plus recently departed Zayn Malik, who are worth £25million each . 'I am a singer. I will stick to what I am good at and not spread myself thin and become mediocre at everything I do.’ The figures have been compiled for the new edition of The Sunday Times Rich List, released this weekend and are based on the information about the stars’ land and property portfolios, stocks in public companies and known assets such as art. The young musicians still have a long way to go to catch their older counterparts. Sir Paul McCartney, 72, and his wife Nancy Shevell, 55, top the list of the richest musicians overall for another year. They have added £20million to their joint fortune this year, bringing their total wealth to £730million. Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber, 67, and the pop group U2 collectively round off the top three, with £650million and £431million respectively. The highest ranked new entry in the overall list is DJ Calvin Harris, who at 31 is just ineligible for the list of young musicians. Songstress Ellie Goulding is the nearest female competition for Adele, with  wealth of around £13million . Also hitting the £13million mark are Leona Lewis (left) and Jessie J (right), according to the Sunday Times . Rumoured to be dating pop star Taylor Swift, 25, he has debuted at number 30 with a fortune of £70million – joint with Mark Knopfler, 65, of Dire Strait’s and The Who’s Pete Townshend, 69. Harris, a Scottish born DJ and producer who has worked with stars including Kylie Minogue, Rihanna and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, is reportedly the world’s highest paid DJ, earning $1million (£665,000) for a single performance. Last year, he was the first solo British album to have his songs played more than one billion times on music streaming service Spotify, earning him a pay cheque of £4million. In last year’s Sunday Times list, Calvin Harris was ranked second richest young musician after Adele, with a fortune of £30million. Graduating to the full rankings, he has more than doubled his wealth over the last 12 months. Sir Paul McCartney has not had a UK number one single in decades but that has not stopped him topping the only chart that counts - the top 40 musical millionaires. The former Beatle has a personal fortune of £730 million - £20 million up from last year - and is well ahead of his nearest rival Andrew Lloyd Webber, who is estimated to be worth £650 million. Sir Paul's fortune is given a significant boost by his wife Nancy Shevell, who has a £150 million stake in her family's US trucking business. Irish rockers U2 share a £431 million fortune, with Sir Elton John and Sir Mick Jagger said to be worth £270 million and £225 million respectively.

"O'Leary had taken the claim to Fifa following his dismissal in April 2011, one year into a three-year contract.
The League Managers' Association (LMA) said despite having sacked O'Leary, the United Arab Emirates club claimed the Irishman had abandoned his job.
The 55-year-old has been awarded the full sum due under his contract.
""Club officials had openly stated to the media at the relevant time that there had been a dismissal,"" said an LMA statement.
Al Ahli also argued that Fifa lacked jurisdiction to hear the claim, but football's world governing body rejected both lines of defence.
O'Leary said: ""It has taken a long time to deal with this matter but I am pleased that all issues have now been finalised.
""I hope my case provides reassurance to all managers and coaches working all over the world that there is a formal system in place that provides employment protection.""
LMA chief executive Richard Bevan added: ""We are clearly delighted with the outcome. In addition, the LMA is extremely grateful to the FA for their assistance in initiating the process with Fifa.
""The added significance and wider impact of this process is the proof that Fifa has mechanisms in place which regulate worldwide employment issues.
""It is extremely encouraging to know that the world governing body can provide a means of redress for managers and coaches at all levels seeking to establish their employment rights, wherever in the world they happen to work."""
"Arsene Wenger has branded the emerging trend of post-season tours as a 'nightmare' after revealing Arsenal opted against an extended pre-season trip. Tottenham have confirmed they will travel to Australia and Malaysia at the end of the Premier League season, while Chelsea are also set to travel abroad when the current campaign finishes. Overseas tours are an important component of clubs PR strategies as they look to maximise their earning potential away from England. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has slammed post season tours as a nightmare . Calum Chambers battles with Radamel Falcao during the Emirates Cup pre-season tournament . But they can also cause headaches for managers who feel such tours - particularly pre-season trips - hamper preparations. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has successfully lobbied for a shorter than anticipated tour of the US this summer. Likewise, Arsenal were exploring the idea of playing additional matches in either India or Malaysia after their initial trip to Singapore - but have decided against it, a decision Wenger is happy with. 'I'm pleased with that because pre-season is always difficult if you cannot prepare well,' said the Arsenal manager . Chelsea are one of several Premier League sides who will be travelling overseas after the season . North London rivals Tottenham will be heading to Australia and Malaysia after the season is done . 'Lets not forget they voted to start early in August next season, which is a bit of nightmare when you think you start on August 8. 'Some players play until June 21 in the Copa America, some in the European Under-21 Championship play until June 14. 'After a season where we have no winter break, I don't see where you go from there to give players a proper rest. It's impossible. 'It is difficult because of the commercial aspect but you want to find a compromise.' Louis van Gaal has successfully lobbied for Manchester United's US tour to be cut short . On the prospect of the Gunners organising a future post-season tour, Wenger, who's side face Burnley on Saturday, added: 'Post season tours are a nightmare - I will never do it. 'In pre-season you have the players under pressure with the focus of starting the season well. 'A post-season tour, I always feel people come along to watch but the players are half on their holidays. 'It is a relaxed atmosphere with none of the intensity of a pre-season game. 'Maybe it is a holiday tour and good to have a relaxed atmosphere together. But from a purely football point of view, there is not much meaning – let’s be honest.'"
"Lee Tomlin's penalty lit up a quiet first period after Tammy Abraham was brought down in the box by Ipswich keeper Bartosz Bialkowski.
David McGoldrick almost levelled the scores soon after half-time, but his low shot was pushed on to the post by Ipswich goalkeeper Frank Fielding.
Luke Freeman sealed the win with a spectacular volley from 25 yards.
The victory was just a second in eight league games for City and lifted the Robins up to 11th in the table, while Town drop to 16th.
Aden Flint felt he should have had a second penalty for City as he went down in the box five minutes after the first spot-kick, but referee Stuart Attwell waved away his protests.
Abraham had a chance to double the lead just before the break, but the 12-goal Chelsea loanee headed over the impressive Tomlin's cross.
After McGoldrick hit the post, Freeman came up with a goal of the season contender as he smashed home a left-foot volley from far outside the box into the bottom corner for his first goal at Ashton Gate.
Bristol City boss Lee Johnson:
""It was a sensational goal. It is a really difficult skill to get the ball to dip from the position Luke struck it.
""It was a really steady and professional team display, almost like an away performance. We have had to come from behind so often, but today we got ourselves in front and looked really solid.
""We haven't got what we deserved from recent games. Now we are three points off the play-offs and looking up the table again.""
Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy:
""The difference between the teams was a penalty and a worldie. They started well, but we got to grips with that.
""We were on top when an unbelievable flying bomb hit the top corner of our net for the second goal. It was absolutely unstoppable.
""I have no complaints about our display. We need to be more effective in the final third, but other than that I felt we competed well against a good side.""

"Ever decided against an outfit because you've already been tagged in it on Facebook? You're not alone. Britons apparently spend £815million a year to ‘social media proof’ their wardrobe, with men forking out more than women, according to a new study. The research into the rise of the 'insta-wardrobe', which polled 2,000 adults, revealed  nearly one third buy new clothes just to avoid being multi-tagged in the same outfit. Brits spend £815m a year to 'social media proof' their wardrobe, according to a new survey . Almost a fifth said that they would refuse to wear an outfit again if they knew there was a chance of appearing wearing the same thing online, the study showed. And, in a surprising result, men appeared to be the most social-conscious gender, spending an average of £61 to safe-guard against this modern day anxiety, as opposed to women’s £53.50. As social media has made fashion and style more accessible than ever, it drives how we shop and what we wear. Facebook recorded 1.39 billion users at the end of 2014, with Instagram growing to over 300 million users with over 70 million photos and videos being shared every day. Almost a fifth of those polled said that they would refuse to wear an outfit again if they knew there was a chance of appearing in the same outfit online (stock image) Fashion industry commentator Lily Melrose says she is constantly inspired to try new styles by other bloggers on social media . The average adult has 338 Facebook friends, meaning their style selfies are being reviewed and commented on by hundreds of people with each upload. Indeed, one in four of those surveyed by TK Maxx said that gaining comments and likes on their outfits on social media inspires them to try new styles. And sources of style inspiration are also changing; 11 per cent of those polled credited bloggers as more inspirational than fashion designers, with fashion news often breaking exclusively via Facebook and Twitter. Bloggers are now gracing the cover of Vogue and fashion designers are live streaming their shows. Lily Melrose, fashion blogger and industry commentator, commented: 'Instagrammers and bloggers are undoubtedly the new tastemakers of obtainable and relatable style. 'Social media has totally changed the face of fashion today and the way we shop. 'The beauty of social sharing sites is that you can be inspired by such a wide range of people, from your friends, bloggers, celebrities and family. 'On social media there is something for everyone as unique and individual looks are celebrated and shared. 'I can’t count the times I’ve been inspired by another blogger or someone on my Instagram page to try something new and I love sharing my looks with my readers.' Deborah Dolce, Group Brand & Marketing Director at TK Maxx said: 'Social media is moving people toward a wide range of fashion ideals and style icons. 'While celebrity culture is still strong, we now look to a much broader base of people for inspiration from our friends to bloggers to online style trailblazers. Social media platforms enable us to express ourselves freely and showcase our personal style.'"
"He was withdrawn from this year's race because of possible irregularities in his biological passport.
But the rider's Tinkoff-Saxo team said that 28-year-old Kreuziger is now free to continue racing.
""The team is very happy he has been cleared and that he is is now eligible to resume racing,"" a statement said.
""He was found not guilty for the alleged abnormalities in his biological passport profile.""
Kreuziger began 2014 by finishing third at the Tirreno-Adriatico in Italy and claiming eighth in the Tour de Suisse.
But he was pulled from his team, although not technically suspended, before the Tour de France.
The International Cycling Union (UCI) decided to ban him provisionally in August pending the Czech Olympic Committee's ruling.
The UCI said in a separate statement it would consider an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. It has one month to lodge a challenge.
The data in question is from Kreuziger's biological passport in 2011 and 2012, when he was riding for the Astana team."
"On 30 October 1974, a fight for the world heavyweight championship took place between George Foreman and Muhammad Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire.
The bout between the then undefeated world heavyweight champion, Foreman, and his charismatic challenger, Ali, came to be known as ""The Rumble in the Jungle"". It is often called one of the greatest sporting events of the 20th Century.
Ali eventually triumphed, knocking Foreman down in the eighth round and reclaiming the title from his significantly younger opponent.
To mark the anniversary of Ali's death last year at the age of 74, photographer Hugh Kinsella Cunningham visited Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Zaire was renamed in 1997) to meet some of the boxers hoping to follow in Ali's footsteps.
The fight was held in the Stade Tata Raphael. Although still surrounded by huge floodlights, it is in a state of disrepair, with only a few of the bulbs remaining.
The stadium is home to a boxing club named in Ali's honour and the next generation of Congolese boxers still hold him in high regard.
There are about 120 semi-regular attendees, including more than 40 who hope to box professionally. Sparring often takes place outside the stadium.
Jorbelle Malewu sits outside the Muhammad Ali Memorial Club, where she has been training since 2010.
Mainly inspired by Mike Tyson, she hopes to go on to box full-time as a professional. At present, she is unemployed.
Another boxer at the club, Dina Yame, practises outside. For him, Ali is an icon. He complains that the government provides no money for the upkeep of the Stade facilities.
There is a shortage of equipment, particularly gloves, and there is no boxing ring so sparring takes place freely around the compound.
However, at fights spectators still sit in the same stands where roughly 60,000 people gathered to watch Ali defeat Foreman.
Dorcas Lukamba has been boxing at the club for only three months, but she is aware of Ali's skill, having seen footage of his fights on DVD.
Her coach, Carlos Kabongo, sits in his office underneath the stadium. Kabongo is a former boxing champion with three gold medals, who modelled his technique on the quick-footed fighting style of ""The Greatest"".
He agrees with Yame about the lack of funding and dislikes the fact that he must charge youngsters a small fee to train within the stadium's historic premises.
Now the director of the state-run television station, RTNC, Pierre Celeste Kabala was a 27-year-old radio journalist at the time of the fight.
He remembers an atmosphere of pure elation in the city in anticipation of the American boxers' arrival.
He too bemoans the lack of support structures and funding for today's Congolese boxers.
The abandoned palace of the country's former leader, Mobutu Sese Seko, stands in Nsele, east of Kinshasa. Ali and Foreman spent much of their summer training here, becoming acclimatised to the tropical weather.
The area is now overgrown and a glaring contrast with the nearby villages.
The ruins are guarded by a handful of troops, but there is little of worth left to protect."
"Video may have killed the radio star, but in Norway it's digital that's killing FM radio. In two years' time, the Scandinavian nation is slated to become the first in the world to phase out radio entirely. That doesn't mean that Norwegians will be left with radio silence; they'll merely have to tune in digitally. According to officials in Oslo, many in this nation of 5 million have already made the move. On FM, Norwegians can only find five stations. On the Digital Audio Broadcasting network, there are four times that number. Half the country already listens that way, said Culture Minister Thorhild Widvey. ""Listeners will have access to more diverse and pluralistic radio-content, and enjoy better sound quality and new functionality,"" Widvey said in a news release. Officials say the move will spur innovation because the cost of digital transmission will save some $25 million. But the country's radio waves won't cut out all once, a blog post on Radio.no explained. Radio will be phased out region by region, starting in January 2017 and concluding in December."
"Thought the vampire face lift and leech facial were weird? The beauty industry is about to get much more bizarre. Foreskin facials are the latest unconventional beauty treatment to be hitting salons - and people who've had them can't stop singing their praises. Dubbed a HydraFacial, the treatment, which costs around $150 (£100) and uses stem cell from an infant's foreskin, is currently available in New York. Scroll down for video . Foreskin facials, also known as HydraFacials, are the latest unconventional beauty treatment to be hitting salons in New York (stock image) Described as a 'multi-step treatment that promises to erase wrinkles, reverse sun damage, lighten dark spots, and prevent acne', the key ingredient is the somewhat bizarre stem cell from an infant's foreskin. Speaking to NY Magazine about the unusual treatment, Dr. Gail Naughton, a leader in regenerative science, said: 'When we're born, our skin is in its best shape. Our cells naturally secrete proteins known as growth factors that keep the cells healthy and stimulate them to divide. One writer who had the treatment hailed its benefits and described her post-facial confidence as being at 'Beyonce levels' and her skin as glowing as Jennifer Lopez's, right . 'As we age, our cells divide at a slower rate, which contribute to the telltale signs of aging, like wrinkles and loss of firmness and luminosity. Growth factors captured from the donated foreskin of a baby (just one can generate over a million treatments) are at their peak ability in promoting rapid cell turnover. 'Applied topically, they spur adult skin cells to regenerate. This is said to have a smoothing effect on the skin.' The 30-minute treatment involves a cleansing process using salicylic-and-glycolic-acid peel and an extraction to remove blackheads and dead skin. This process is followed by a mask packed with hydrating hyaluronic acid and a serum with foreskin extracts and rounded off with some light therapy. One writer, Ashley Weatherford, who had the treatment hailed its benefits, describing her post-facial confidence as at 'Beyonce levels' and her skin as glowing as Jennifer Lopez's. The 30-minute treatment (not pictured) involves a cleansing process using salicylic-and-glycolic-acid peel, an extraction, a mask packed with hydrating hyaluronic acid and a serum with foreskin extracts . Commenting on the trend, Anne-Marie Gillett, Non-Surgical Director at Transform Cosmetic Surgery, told FEMAIL: 'The HydraFacial, commonly known as the ""Foreskin Facial"" is an interesting concept and is one that we will be keeping our eye on here at Transform. 'We’ve seen a whole host of faddish non-surgical treatments coming over from the US - last year it was the vampire facial, which had a celebrity fan base, with the likes of Kim Kardashian openly talking about having had the treatment. This year, it seems to be the HydraFacial, but we often find that these extreme treatments seem to disappear as quickly as they come. 'It’s no surprise, as there are numerous new treatments hitting the market all the time, particularly ones with the ""wow"" and shock factor, but how effective they actually are is questionable. We’ll have to wait and see. 'If you want to keep your skin looking its best, it’s important to maintain a good skincare regime which involves limiting sun exposure, avoiding smoking and excessive drinking, which can dehydrate the skin and accelerate the ageing process. 'We would urge anyone who is considering having a non-surgical treatment, to do their research and be confident with what’s on offer and that the person providing the treatment is appropriately qualified. Also, it’s important for patients to manage their expectations when it comes to the results.' The 'baby foreskin facial' will, however, never be coming to the UK as it is illegal to use human cells in cosmetic procedures. The USA-owned company are currently in the process of creating the same effect, by using plant extract and bringing that to the UK."
"An eight-year-old abuse survivor, who was beaten so severely as an infant that she permanently lost the use of her legs, has written a heartwrenching open letter to her social workers and detectives thanking them for investigating her case and placing her in a happy home where she is loved. Marie Surprenant, from Atlanta, Georgia, was eight-months-old and weighed only 14lbs when she was admitted to the Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta with more than 14 fractures, numerous bruises and a spinal cord injury that left her paraplegic. After her biological mother and her boyfriend were arrested, Marie was placed into foster care and later adopted by Michele Surprenant. 'I want to thank you for making me happy by giving me a new warm and safe environment,' Marie began her handwritten letter, which was published on Children's Healthcare of Atlanta's blog. 'Now I have a home that is nice and I have three nice meals a day.' All smiles: Abuse survivor Marie Surprenant was photographed with her adoptive mother Michele during a trip to the beach . Marie, who was recently accepted into one of the city’s top private schools for the fourth grade, went on to introduce herself and tell her story. 'When I was a baby I got hurt and you were on my case,' she wrote. 'When I was little I got hurt and I wasn't going to walk at all.' Marie wrote a detailed account of how her biological mother's boyfriend lied in the emergency room about how she got her injuries, claiming that she fell out of bed. She noted that because her social workers 'got involved and solved' her case the 'bad guy' is no longer hurting her - or anyone else. 'I think that if you never helped me my life would still be awful and lonely. Because they might not help me, not feed me or they would hit me when I cried' she said. 'But now I'm much better. I now have a safe happy environment. I am also around smart people. [sic]' Marie said her life 'is so much better', although she noted that her dog Jo's snoring drives her crazy. She continued by giving detailed descriptions of her cats Gypsy and Mr Fluffy. Marie, who said she 'loves pets', also talked about her class' bearded dragon Mr Cuddles. She ended her candid letter by writing: 'I wish that you keep doing what you do to make the world a better place and to make kids feel protected. I also wish that no matter how big or small the case is you will at least try and help the kids.' And amazingly, Marie's letter, which has become one of the blog's most read posts, found its way to one of the people who helped change her life. Grateful child: The eight-year-old wrote this later because she wanted to thank the social workers who 'investigated and solved' her case after she was abused by her biological mother and her boyfriend . Animal love: Marie also described her two cats and her dog in her handwritten letter . Never quit: She ended her message by encouraging other social workers to always do their best to help children like herself . 'This is Ms Rita your case worker,' social worker Rita Goodman wrote in the comment section of the post. 'I'm in a wheelchair sometimes myself now. I had to retire [two] years ago. I'm so glad to hear you are happy [sic.]. She added: 'I am also so proud of you. You are one of my best memories of the 12 years I spent in child welfare.' Marie's adoptive mother Michele, who is also a social worker, revealed in the blog post that it was her daughter's idea to write the letter because she is grateful for what she has. I now have a safe happy environment . Michele explained that Marie is 'living proof that ""social work works""', adding that her little girl is nearly nine-years-old and she is a straight A student who is 'wise beyond her years'. She recalled how Marie learned to push her wheelchair on her own when she was only 17-months-old. '[Marie's] future looks bright, and we know very well that none of this success would have been possible without the amazing team of social workers, detectives and medical staff in Atlanta,' Michele wrote. 'Thank you for being the stepping stone that [t]his little, baby girl needed. While Marie's paralysis causes scoliosis, requiring her to have rods in her back and surgery every six months, Michele told ABC News that her injuries have inspired her to become an orthopedic surgeon. 'Every time she sees her orthopedic surgeon, she's asking him career planning questions,' she said. 'But I told her sometimes he has to be at work at 6am some days, and she thinks that's a little too early. She's wondering if she'll be able to work the night shift.'"

"Haroon Syed, of west London, admitted preparing acts of terrorism after trying to source weapons including a suicide bomb and machine gun.
He was caught after approaching MI5 officers, who were posing as a fellow extremist, via social media.
Syed was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years and six months.
Last year, his brother was jailed for life for plotting to behead someone on Remembrance Sunday.
Judge Michael Topolski QC said Syed wanted to carry out ""an act of mass murder"" and therefore a discretionary life sentence was warranted.
Prosecutors say Syed's plans ranged from becoming a suicide bomber to staging a gun attack, and while he initially boasted of working with others, those people did not materialise.
Instead, over the summer of last year, he made increasingly urgent efforts to secure weaponry.
After he went online looking for help, a purported jihadist fighting overseas, known only as Abu Isa, introduced him to another extremist going by the name Abu Yusuf.
This second man was, in fact, a group of MI5 officers who were playing the role of a jihadist in what became weeks of social media chat with Syed.
Teen admits planning 'London bomb attack'
Duncan Penny QC, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey there was initially some ""suspicion on both sides"" before Abu Yusuf concluded that Syed was a ""committed brother"" he could deal with.
Syed then began talking about his aspirations and gave his contact a shopping list, saying he wanted ""do martyrdom"" after first causing ""damage"" with a machine gun.
""Can you get the gear?"" asked Syed. ""You will be involved right?
""Two things. Number one, machine gun and we need someone who can make a vest you know the dugma [button] one. So after some damage with machine gun then do itishadi [martyrdom] ... that's what I'm planning to do.""
The undercover officer told Syed guns were expensive - but he might be able to get someone to build a bomb. Syed floated the idea of going to fight overseas with his new-found friend - but revealed his passport had been cancelled by the authorities.
He tried and failed twice to get fraudulent loans of thousands of pounds to cover the cost of firearms - and eventually agreed to meet his contact in a coffee shop in Slough, Berkshire, to finalise an alternative plan.
Over two meetings, he talked about his aspirations and then handed over Â£150, asking for a bomb packed with nails. The conversation was secretly recorded.
""I was thinking of Oxford Street,"" he told his contact. ""If you put those things inside called nails, do you know what that is, nails? Those sharp things - lots of them inside.
""Good man, can't wait akhi [brother]. If I go to prison, I go to prison. If I die, I die, you understand? I have got to get to Jannah [heaven].""
The undercover officer later told Syed a ""bomb-making brother"" would have the device ready within days - and the suspect went online to narrow his list of targets.
His web searches included ""packed places in London"" and ""Elton John, Hyde Park, 11 September"" - a major concert hosted by BBC Radio 2 which also featured Status Quo and Madness.
Prosecutors say Syed's character had begun to change outwardly in late 2014, coinciding with the growing support among British extremists for the self-styled Islamic State group.
During the course of the investigation, detectives found his web searches jumped about as he tried to satisfy himself that an attack on civilians was theologically justifiable.
One of his last searches, a week before his arrest, was: ""How can I stop being upset about the UK killing innocent Syrians and get on with my day?""
When counter-terrorist detectives arrested him in September and asked him for the password for his phone, he replied: ""ISIS - you like that?""
Syed's was one of 18 terror plots to have been foiled since 2013.
Mitigating, Mark Summers QC said it was a ""crude, ill-thought-out"" plan made at the behest of others.
The court heard Syed had fallen under the influence of members of banned extremist group Al-Muhajiroun, and that he now publicly rejected his past beliefs and condemned the recent bomb attack in Manchester.
But Judge Topolski told Syed: ""You were not lured, you were not enticed, you were not entrapped.
""You became, and in my judgement as shown by your online activities away from your contact with Abu Yusuf, deeply committed to the ideology of a brutal and barbaric organisation that sought to hijack and corrupt an ancient and venerable religion for its own purposes and you wanted to be part of it.""
Deb Walsh, deputy head of the counter-terrorism division of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""Haroon Syed is clearly a danger to the public who was prepared to carry out indiscriminate attacks against innocent people.
""The compelling evidence presented by the CPS left him with no choice but to plead guilty."""
"Bayern Munich moved a step closer to a third straight Bundesliga title thanks to a 3-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt. Robert Lewandowski boosted his own chances of winning the golden boot award at the end of his first season with Bayern, and a second in a row after finishing the league's top-scorer with Borussia Dortmund last season, by netting two goals in a commanding victory for Pep Guardiola's men.

It was downhill all the way for Bayern after Lewandowski gave them the lead after only 15 minutes. Thomas Muller put him in position to shoot, but it took a sweet, unstoppable volley to beat Kevin Trapp into the top left-hand corner. Lewandowski could have had a second goal 10 minutes later, but Trapp reacted well to deny him. Bayern had the ball in the back of the net again shortly before half-time, but after consultation with his linesman, the referee ruled out Muller's effort for offside, even though the ball came to him from an opponent. Bayern were again close to a second on the hour mark when Mario Gotze struck the left-hand post, with the ball rebounding out to safety. The hosts did not have long to wait for their second, though, with Gotze's shot blocked by Makoto Hasebe, but the ball fell kindly for Lewandowski to tuck in for his 16th goal of the season. He is now just three behind Eintracht Frankfurt's Alexander Meier. Lewandoski did not complete his hat-trick, but there was a third in the match for Bayern with Muller netting from a tight angle in the 82nd minute, setting the Bavarians up in style for their Champions League quarter-final with Porto in midweek.

"He rarely ever publicly criticizes his successor, Barack Obama. But on Saturday night, George W. Bush apparently lashed out at the President's foreign policy. Speaking at a closed-door meeting with Jewish donors in Las Vegas,  the 68-year-old former leader suggested that Obama's plan to lift sanctions on Iran was not plausible - and comes too early. He noted that the country's government and President Hassan Rouhani appear to be caving in - and implied that America could lose leverage if it relaxes sanctions on Tehran anytime soon. And he said that the comprehensive nuclear deal - which is currently being negotiated by six global powers, including the US - would likely have a negative impact on US national security in the future. Scroll down for video . Rare remarks: Speaking at a  meeting with Jewish donors in Las Vegas, George W Bush (pictured) suggested that President Barack Obama's plan to lift sanctions on Iran was not plausible - and comes too early . 'You think the Middle East is chaotic now? Imagine what it looks like for our grandchildren. That’s how Americans should view the deal,' Bush told donors at the Republican Jewish Coalition session. Bush's concerns are in stark contrast to Obama's belief that although the contents of the agreement - which were announced at the start of April - 'may not be optimal,' they are America's 'best bet'. In an interview with the New York Times, Obama remarked: 'This is our best bet by far to make sure Iran doesn’t get a nuclear weapon.' But he noted the deal could see 'real political difficulties'. Bush's administration initially began the diplomatic effort to confront the Iranian regime about its nuclear program. He also made attempts early in his administration to negotiate with North Korea. During his comments on Saturday, transcribed by an attendee at the event at the Venetian Hotel and obtained by Bloomberg, the former president told donors that he would not criticize Obama. He congratulated his successor on his ambition to degrade and destroy the Islamic State, which has taken over large swathes of Iraq and Syria and beheaded US journalists on video last year. Leaders: Bush, who rarely ever publicly criticizes Obama, noted that the Iranian government and President Hassan Rouhani appear to be caving in. Above, Bush, left, greets Obama in Selma, Alabama, in March . Terror group: Bush initially congratulated his successor on his aim to degrade and destroy the Islamic State. But he went on to imply that Obama has failed to keep his promises and is losing the war against the group . But he then went on to suggest that Obama had failed to follow through on his promises, saying that one of the key issues was that the Democrat did not develop a military strategy to defeat the terror group. 'In order to be an effective president ... when you say something you have to mean it,' he said, according to Bloomberg, implying that Obama is losing the war against ISIS. 'You gotta kill em.' Bush even reportedly touted his own success in capturing Islamic terrorist Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who murdered Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl and countless others. In relation to Obama's decision to withdraw all American troops from Iraq in 2011, Bush cited Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, who has publicly criticized the President's foreign policy. He quoted him as saying: 'Pulling out of Iraq was a strategic blunder,' according to theNew York Times, which collected accounts of Bush's comments from around 12 people at the session. A dangerous last name? Bush apparently remarked that his brother, presidential candidate Jeb Bush (above) could encounter struggles in his campaign due to his last name because Americans do not like dynasties . Bush's comments followed an interview with CBS News last November in which he suggested that the draw down of troops in the war-torn country had allowed ISIS to flourish and recruit more militants. Speaking to news station in a two-part interview, the politician said he thought it was 'the right decision' to take military action in 2003 in a bid to oust Saddam Hussein. But he added: 'My regret is that…a violent group of people have risen up again…This is ""Al-Qaeda plus""…they need to be defeated. And I hope we do…I hope the strategy works.' During Saturday's question-and-answer session, Bush also told anecdotes about his old friend, Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he said had once told him that his dog was 'bigger, stronger and faster' than Bush's own. Bush considered the  comparison to show Putin did not think in 'win-win' terms, he said. He also apparently remarked that his  brother, presidential candidate Jeb Bush, could encounter struggles in his campaign due to his last name because Americans do not like dynasties. And he called Hillary Rodham Clinton 'formidable', but beatable, the Times reported. The session was attended by Republican donor Sheldon Adelson, who owns the Venetian hotel. It comes as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is due to meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in New York on Monday, according to a senior State Department official. Kerry, who will be participating in a nuclear non-proliferation conference that opens at the United Nations on Monday, will also apparently meet with Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh.

That looked to have put him firmly in contention, with playing partner and defending champion Matt Kuchar holding the clubhouse lead at the time on eight under. Yet Merritt took everyone by surprise with a storming run which saw him pick up seven shots on the back nine and shoot to the top of the leaderboard on 12 under overall. The 29-year-old American, who finished a flawless round with four successive birdies, admitted everything simply fell into place for him. 'It was a lot of fun,' he told the PGA Tour website. 'I had the college mentality of 'just try to make one more (birdie), just try to make one more and see what happens'. And I was just fortunate to close with four in a row. 'I haven't played poorly all year, it's just the tempo issue with me. If I don't have it right away, it's tough to find it and then I'm scrabbling all day and trying to shoot one or two under. Today I wasn't worrying about that.' Kuchar is tied for second place with John Merrick, having followed his first-round 68 with a 66.

"A Health Protection Agency study found a 10-fold increased risk in cases of the sleep disorder in children seen in sleep centres who had received the jab.
Manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has been ordered to investigate the link.
Families who believe they were affected are now considering a group legal action.
Pandemrix was most widely used in the UK during the 2009-10 flu pandemic and given to almost a million British children  between six months and five years old. The vaccine, which is no longer used, has already been linked to narcolepsy in youngsters from Finland, Sweden and Ireland.
Narcolepsy is a rare sleeping condition. The main symptom is falling asleep suddenly and it may also cause muscle weakness.
The HPA abstract paper, from Developmental Medicine in Childhood Neurology, was presented to a conference of  paediatricians in Manchester and is now being considered for publication in full by the British Medical Journal. It estimates the risk was one in 52,000 in those vaccinated.
Specialists reviewed 75 children aged four to 18 who developed narcolepsy about the time Pandemrix was rolled out. Of these, 18 had received Pandemrix.
They found a 10-fold increased risk of the condition within six months of having the jab which ""suggests a causal association consistent with reports from Finland and Sweden"".
An expert in vaccines who was in charge of one of the paediatric clinical trials of Pandemrix, Prof Adam Finn from the University of Bristol, said: ""The risk is so much increased that it seems very unlikely that this is a biased result.
""The bottom line is they have found they were somewhere between 10 and 16 times more likely to have had Pandemrix than other children. So that confirms what you would expect to see based on other studies done in Finland, Sweden and Ireland, which are all the same.""
Research programme
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) warned in 2011 that Pandemrix should only be given to children and teenagers at risk of H1N1 flu if other jabs are unavailable because of concerns of potential link to narcolepsy.
It has ordered GSK to commit to a complex research programme to look at the root causes.
GSK say they take the safety of patients very seriously and are  working hard to better understand the research emerging from a select number of countries.
A spokesperson said: ""Narcolepsy is a complex disease and its causes are not yet fully understood but it is generally considered to be associated with genetic and environmental factors, including infections.
""It is crucial that we learn more about how narcolepsy is triggered and how Pandemrix might have interacted with other risk factors in affected individuals. Throughout development there was no data suggesting a potential for an increased risk of narcolepsy among those vaccinated.""
It is understood that one possible trigger is the high levels of adjuvant in the vaccine used to enhance the recipients response.
The UK government, which gave GSK a legal indemnity against having to pay compensation, could now face the prospect of a group legal action by families affected.
The Department of Work and Pensions, which is responsible for administering Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme says there is currently insufficient medical evidence to show that the swine flu vaccine causes narcolepsy.
A spokesperson for the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  said: ""The results of the HPA study are consistent with earlier evidence from some other EU countries and support the regulatory action already taken in Europe to restrict the use of Pandemrix in those aged under 20 years."""
"MI5 covered up the sexual abuse of boys in the notorious Kincora home, a former Army Intelligence officer claimed last night. Brian Gemmell, a former captain in the Intelligence Corps, said spy chiefs ordered him to ‘stop digging’ when he reported a possible paedophile ring at the Northern Ireland children’s’ home. He spoke out during a meeting with victim Richard Kerr, who claimed he was one of three youngsters trafficked from the home before being molested by ‘very powerful’ figures in a Westminster paedophile gang. Scroll down for video . Brian Gemmell, a former captain in the Army Intelligence Corps (pictured), said MI5 spy chiefs ordered him to ‘stop digging’ when he reported a possible paedophile ring at the Northern Ireland children’s’ home, Kincora . He claimed he was sexually abused by politicians and other senior men at Dolphin Square apartment complex in Pimlico and Elm Guest House, in Barnes, west London, which are being investigated by Scotland Yard amid ‘credible’ claims a Tory MP murdered a young boy. Campaigners claim Mr Kerr’s account provides a clear link between VIP paedophile rings in London and Belfast. MI5 has faced long-standing allegations of covering up child abuse to enable it to gather intelligence on Loyalist politicians during the Troubles. But it has also been accused of not acting to protect leading Establishment figures involved in the crimes. Mr Gemmell, who served in military intelligence in Belfast, presented a report on allegations of abuse at Kincora to a senior MI5 officer in 1975 but to his astonishment was told to quit his probe. Speaking to Mr Kerr on Channel 4 News, he said: ‘That’s the thing that hits me - that if I really pushed the thing through, you could have been rescued. I’m sorry.’ His revelations will strengthen calls for the allegations about the Irish children’s home to be covered by the judge-led abuse inquiry announced by Home Secretary Theresa May. The inquiry will investigate whether public bodies, including governments, charities, the Church and BBC, failed to protect children. It was set up amid claims a child sex gang operated in Westminster in the 1980s. The investigation into historical abuse, which will be led by New Zealand High Court judge, Justice Lowell Goddard, is likely to be able to study files held by MI5. Mr Gemmell said: ‘I think Richard’s transporting over to the United Kingdom mainland to be abused, rather than just being abused in Northern Ireland, speaks volumes. It ties the two together.’ Mr Gemmell met with victim Richard Kerr, who claimed he was one of three youngsters trafficked from Kincora (pictured) before being molested by ‘very powerful’ figures in a Westminster paedophile gang . Speaking to Channel 4 News, Mr Kerr, who now lives in Dallas, Texas, said he and two other boys suffered abuse at Kincora in the mid-1970s before being trafficked to London in 1977, where they suffered further abuse. Boys - many in local authority care - are alleged to have been abused by figures including the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith, Cabinet ministers, clergymen, pop stars, spies, judges and members of the royal household. MI5 has been accused of suppressing allegations of child abuse against the politician, who died in 2010, when they were made during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The Kincora children’s home in east Belfast was run by William McGrath, the head of an extreme Protestant loyalist group called Tara and an alleged MI5 informant. He and two other members of staff – William Semple and Joseph Mains – were jailed in 1981 for sexually assaulting boys in their care. In February, lawyers for victims challenging the refusal to include Kincora in Justice Goddard’s wide-ranging inquiry told the High Court in Belfast that MI5 was aware of the abuse but allowed it to continue to protect those responsible from prosecution."

Ibrahimovic is the club's record goalscorer despite only joining the club in 2012, his 152 goals coming in 178 appearances.
PSG have won Ligue 1 in every season Ibrahimovic has been at the club, wrapping up the title this season with two months to spare.
""I loved every day I spent here,"" said Ibrahimovic, who has won league titles with six different clubs. ""Paris St-Germain has become a star club in the world and I played a key role moving it forward. It is now the right time for me to take a different path.""

"The government said that protests against the bill had given ministers ""food for thought"".
Poland already has among the tightest abortion laws in Europe, and the proposal sought to ban all abortions unless the mother's life was at risk.
MPs voted to reject the bill by 352 votes to 58.
The bill came from an anti-abortion citizens' initiative that gathered some 450,000 signatures. It was initially backed by the Catholic Church, but bishops then said they could not support one of the proposals, to jail women who had an abortion.
Poland's tussle over abortion ban
The proposals were not sponsored by Poland's ruling, socially conservative Law and Justice party (PiS) and MPs were given a free vote. However, many PiS MPs initially voted to back the bill when it went before parliament last month.
Some 100,000 people, mostly women, protested against the proposals in cities across Poland on Monday and appeared to prompt the PiS to swing against the bill, although the party promotes Catholic values.
Prime Minister Beata Szydlo distanced herself from a change to the law and Deputy Prime Minister Jaroslaw Gowin moved to reassure women on Wednesday that a total ban would not get through.
""Abortion will certainly not be banned when the woman is the victim of rape or if her life or her health is in danger,"" he insisted.
Since Law and Justice came to power last year, it has been criticised by the EU for taking control of state media appointments and for reforms to Poland's constitutional court.
Abortion is already largely banned in Poland. The only exceptions are a severe and irreversible damage to the foetus, a serious threat to the mother's health, or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.
The Stop Abortion campaign group wanted the ban extended to cases of rape and incest. The only exception would have been where the mother's life was in danger.
Doctors already risk punishment if they carry out an illegal termination. But the tighter proposals would have made abortion punishable with an five-year prison term.
In the end this was a bill that not even the Catholic Church could support.
Just before the vote in parliament, Poland's bishops put out a statement saying that while they opposed abortion they did not support punishing women for having the procedure.
The proposed ban was not popular amongst most Poles, even though some members of the right-wing ruling party initially supported it.
The scale of Monday's protests clearly gave Law and Justice food for thought, and the education and science minister Jaroslaw Gowin spoke about a lesson in humility.
After the vote, Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said a pro-life education campaign would be prepared instead.
It seems that a 23 year-old compromise, which only allows abortion in cases of rape or incest or when the health of the mother or foetus is seriously endangered, will remain in place."
"The boy, from Lincolnshire, groomed some of the girls on Facebook and encouraged them to send him photos of their breasts.
He was aged between 14 and 16 when he committed the 10 offences over a 17-month period.
His victims were five girls aged between 12 and 15.
Sentencing the boy, who cannot be named, Judge Michael Heath said he regarded him as ""dangerous"" but would not impose an extended sentence because of his age.
The teenager was made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order and must also register as a sex offender.
Judge Heath told him: ""You targeted and groomed girls, and indulged in persistent pestering of these girls because of their age, by social media and other means.""
The boy admitted the 10 offences, which included three charges of rape.
Grace Hale, prosecuting, said two of the girls were encouraged to perform a sexual act on the boy while another had underage sex with him.
In a statement read out at Lincoln Crown Court, one of the victims described how afterwards she felt ""horrible, used, scared and worried.""
In mitigation, Caroline Bradley said the boy had been badly bullied by his peers at school and found it easier to mix with younger children.
Miss Bradley told the court he was a bright boy who worked hard within his family and understood what he had done was wrong."

"The children laugh and shriek, as some of them seem to always have the capacity to do no matter how depressing the circumstances. Their bright clothes provide splashes of color against the otherwise drab monotone white of the endless rows of tents. A small group plays with rocks, replacements for the toys they left behind when they fled, while others clamber through a jagged tear in the wire fence surrounding the refugee camp. The Shariya refugee camp opened around six months ago, made up of some 4,000 tents and counting. Thousands of Yazidis now call this corner of Iraqi Kurdistan home, about 18 miles (30 kilometers) from one of the front lines with ISIS, where one can hear the occasional reverberation in the distance of what we are told are airstrikes. The vast majority of the camp's occupants are from the town of Sinjar, which is near the border with Syrian Kurdistan, and fled the ISIS assault there back in August. But not everyone escaped. ISIS took thousands of Yazidis captive. The fighters separated the young women and girls, some as young as 8 years old, to be sold as slaves, for their ""masters"" to use as concubines. Men faced a choice: Convert to Islam or be shot. Mahmoud was out running errands when ISIS fighters arrived, taking his wife, Ahlam, their three children -- the youngest of which was just a month old -- and his elderly parents. ""They took our phones, jewelry, money,"" Ahlam recalls. ""They had guns. They forced us at gunpoint into big trailer trucks."" They were taken to a school turned prison in Tal Afar. From there, the family was moved from village to village -- and at one stage taken to Mosul. ""They wrote everyone's name down and they asked where we want to work, in the fields, as cleaners or as herders,"" she says. Ahlam and her family chose to herd goats. They were then taken to a Shia village whose residents had fled, where they were part of a group of around 40 living in one house. In the home, Ahlam found a cell phone left behind by its former occupants and called her husband. ""I said we are alive but we are prisoners."" Ahlam's husband, who up until that moment had lost the will to live, thinking his family was dead, says he cried out of happiness despite his pain. Ahlam would call when she could, briefly, after midnight, hiding under her bedcovers. If she was caught with a phone, she would be killed. The village itself was a massive prison, its entrances guarded by ISIS fighters. She recalls that two men, in their late 40s or 50s, tried to escape. When they were caught, their bones were broken, their bodies tied to the back of a truck and then driven through the streets. The Yazidi captives were forced to watch the gruesome spectacle. The men's corpses were then tossed into a ditch and an order given not to bury them. One night, some of the Yazidi men risked their lives to toss dirt onto the bodies, to give those slain what dignity they could. Ahlam tells us that about a week before we met, ISIS fighters came by and took away her in-laws and the other elderly people living in the house. ""We didn't know where they were taking them, we thought we would be next,"" she remembers. So she and the rest of the group realized that they had to try to flee. ""We decided that either we survive or we don't."" They left at midnight. Ahlam cradled the baby, as her two other children, ages 3 and 4 years old, clutched at her clothes. She prayed the baby wouldn't cry, that the children could keep walking. They knew the general direction to take, but not the exact route, and they could only hope it was toward freedom. ""When the sun started to come up, I thought that's it, we are going to get caught,"" Ahlam says. ""And what am I going to do with the kids?  I can't carry all three of them and run."" Luckily, Ahlam never had to answer that impossible question. The group made it into Iraqi Kurdistan. The couple can't put into words their emotions when they were reunited. Mahmoud, gently caressing his daughter's palm, says he could hardly believe that the woman whose stunning eyes and gentle words he had fallen in love with, and their three children, were by his side again. It had been eight agonizing months. But their joy was tainted by fear for Mahmoud's parents. A few days after Mahmoud and Ahlam were reunited, ISIS released 217 captives. No one is disclosing exactly why. Among them were 60 children, a handful of men and women, and the rest were elderly -- including Mahmoud's parents. ""We didn't know if they were going to slaughter us or what they were going to do with us,"" Mahmoud's father says. ""They moved us around a lot, and at one stage we stayed in in one place for three days."" But Ahlam's parents are still with ISIS. Vian Dakhil, a Yazidi member of Iraq's parliament, speculates that the Yazidis ISIS released are individuals they were struggling to care for. Dakhil is part of Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's delegation to the United States this week. She will be addressing the United Nations -- pleading for more international support for Iraq and more airstrikes to help defeat ISIS -- and she will address the plight of the Yazidis. ""We sometimes say that we wish we had been massacred. This would be better than being kidnapped and raped. We prefer death now over the fate of what is happening to these girls and women,"" Dakhil says. ""It is now on the government and on the international community to focus on this. How to get these captives back. It's inconceivable that in the 21st century, something like this is happening as if we were living in the Stone Age."" Ahlam says she was spared because she was breastfeeding and she had young children, which, we're told, makes her impure and therefore unable to be used as a sex slave. For Ahlam, what she went through was not the hardest part of her ordeal. It's the moment when the ISIS fighters began taking away the girls and young women. She's haunted by their screams, the image of them being dragged away sobbing and screaming."

"Khieu Samphan, the former head of state, and Nuon Chea, Pol Pot's deputy, are already on trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
The second trial includes a charge of genocide related to killings of Vietnamese and Cham Muslim minorities.
The cases are being tried separately to accelerate proceedings, because the defendants are elderly.
A verdict in the first case, meanwhile, is expected on 7 August. Prosecutors are seeking life sentences for the two former leaders.
The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia for four years, from 1975 to 1979. Up to two million people are thought to have died of starvation, overwork or by execution under the brutal Maoist regime.
Leader Pol Pot died in 1997 and only one senior official - former prison chief Duch - has been convicted and jailed for crimes committed by the regime.
Two other leaders were to be tried, but Ieng Sary - the former foreign minister - died last year and his wife, former social affairs minister Ieng Thirith, was ruled unfit to stand trial.
The first trial has largely focused on crimes committed as the urban population was forcibly moved into rural labour camps.
The second trial will address the roles of Nuon Chea, 88, and Khieu Samphan, 83, in the killings of tens - possibly hundreds - of thousands of people from Cambodia's ethnic minority groups.
The issue of forced marriages and rape will also be covered by proceedings.
The opening hearing takes place today, with the trial expected to continue possibly until 2016."

"Telecom watchdogs are to stop a rip-off that allows mobile phone firms to charge customers to call supposedly free 0800 numbers. Currently mobile phone companies charge customers up to 20p a minute to dial what are free numbers from a landline phone. The net result is that millions of people dialling what should be free services run by the NHS, the government and company call centres end up paying hefty charges. Scroll down for video . End call: Charges of up to 20p a minute being charged by operators for free 0800 numbers will end from July 1 under proposals published by the telecoms watchdog, Ofcom, today . Alternatively, some who rely on mobile phones rather than landlines are put off accessing these services by the cost. The charges will end from July 1 under proposals published by the telecoms watchdog, Ofcom, today. The changes were fought by the mobile phone networks, which have been making tens of millions of pounds a year from customers calling the numbers. In 2013, the biggest mobile network, EE, even threatened to take legal action to block the move. At the time, the company, which is about to be taken over by BT in a deal worth £12.5billion, complained getting rid of charges for 0800 numbers was ‘ill thought out’ and would ‘crush an already struggling industry segment’. It argued the change could cost up to £57.5 million to implement and that mobile networks would simply put up other charges to make up for any lost income. Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at the price comparison service, uSwitch.com, said the end to mobile charges to call 0800 numbers was a ‘long-overdue victory for common-sense’. EE claims the plan is ill thought out and will make an already struggling industry suffer . A spokesman for the telecoms price comparison website, broadbandchoices.co.uk, welcomed moves to make the price of calls clearer to consumers. He said: ‘Making ‘0800’ numbers free from all telephones including mobile phones is excellent news since it’s rarely practical to redial from a landline to avoid charges for what are generally assumed to be ‘free phone’ numbers. ‘Greater cost transparency and simplicity of charging is badly needed in the landline and mobile phone sector. We regularly hear from consumers who are confronted with charges on their phone bill that they were unaware of.’ The changes are part of a wider shake-up in call charges to non-geographic numbers, which are described by Ofcom as the ‘biggest overhaul of phone calls in more than a decade’. They are part of a new regime imposing new rules covering the cost of calling the 084, 087 and 09 numbers used in TV show phone polls, by businesses, GP surgeries and government departments – as well as 118 directory enquiry numbers. At the moment, the cost of calling these numbers is mired in confusion with charges varying enormously depending on whether you are using a landline or a mobile phone. In future, organisations using these numbers will be required to advertise a single ‘service charge’ for dialling them. Separately, each phone company will apply an ‘access charge’ for putting people through. Consumers will add the two figures together to work out the full cost, which will vary depending on which phone company they are signed to. Ofcom and phone companies will be publicising the changes under the banner UK Calling before the switch in the summer. The regulator’s chief executive, Sharon White, said: ‘In July we’ll see the biggest changes to phone calls in over a decade, affecting 175 million phone numbers. ‘The changes are important for people who enjoy interacting with their favourite shows, but also for everyone calling companies and organisations on 08, 09 and 118 numbers. s.poulter@dailymail.co.uk ."
"A Leave vote was always seen as more likely to generate significant disturbances in the financial world.
For that reason it is also the result which was thought more likely to pose a headache for the world's central banks.
There have already been statements from some that they are prepared to act to maintain financial stability.
There are two potential issues they might want to respond to in the short term: the stability of the (commercial) banks and swings in exchange rates.
With the banks there is a possibility of a general rise in risk aversion, and some might have difficulty borrowing in the inter-bank market. The ultimate danger from that is that they might be unable to make debt payments as they come due.
Central banks can address that by lending them extra money (liquidity). In the UK the Bank of England has already been doing this ahead of the referendum, hoping to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity already in place. The Bank has said it ""will continue to monitor market conditions carefully and keep its operations under review"".
Other central banks will be ready to take similar action if they think it's needed.
What if the strains show up in terms of foreign currency liquidity - say an Italian bank needing quick access to Swiss francs?
There are arrangements known as swap lines put in place during the international financial crisis that can be used if necessary. The Italian bank could then get Swiss francs from the European Central Bank (ECB), (and the Swiss National Bank would be able to offer euros to Swiss banks if needed). The Bank of England is involved in these arrangements so it can get foreign currency if British banks were to need it urgently.
With sharp moves in exchange rates, there are several options. They could just live with it. But if they felt the swings were too sharp and destabilising they could intervene using their foreign currency reserves.
In the case of the UK, the decision to conduct such intervention is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, with the Bank of England carrying it out in the markets.
So if there were too precipitous a fall in the value of one currency (sterling would be the obvious candidate in the event of a leave vote) the Bank of England could buy sterling with dollars or yen from its reserves, hoping the additional demand for the pound would support its value.
Conversely the Swiss National Bank has been worried about too rapid a rise in the Swiss franc and has already been into the markets to buy other currencies such as the euro with its own national currency.
Further action on these lines is a possibility. Currencies seen as havens are susceptible to unwanted sharp rises in times of financial stress and the Swiss franc is a prime example of that.
Currency market intervention is often not announced. Some observers say there is evidence suggesting that the Swiss central bank might have intervened over the past week.  The intervention after the vote by the SNB was announced however.
Interest rates can also be used to curb currency moves - a cut to stop a currency rising; a rate rise to prevent a fall.
Both options, interest rate moves and intervention, can be co-ordinated by central banks.
Further quantitative easing (QE) is also a possible response to a rising currency. It tends to drive down market interest rates and there has been some speculation that it might be on the agenda very soon,  perhaps from the Bank of Japan (which does not want to see the yen gaining value).
Interest rate moves and QE can also be used to address longer term fallout - to tackle any impact on inflation or growth. The Bank of England has scope to cut rates further and it could undertake further QE. A fall in sterling would be inflationary, though up to a point that could be welcome as inflation is currently (at 0.3%) far below the Bank's target (2%).
Another risk is that in a general flight from riskier assets the government debt problem in the eurozone could return, pushing up borrowing costs for countries such as Spain and Italy that were in the firing line a few years ago.
Those earlier eurozone storms abated after the ECB announced that it was prepared in some circumstances to buy the bonds, the debts, of governments severely affected. In the event it never used this new weapon. The mere threat of doing so was enough to settle the eurozone bond market.
Some observers, such as the London consultancy Capital Economics, think it could finally use this programme, if the aftermath of a leave vote were sufficiently disruptive.
The likely timescale for these options varies.  In principle many could be done very quickly. The most urgent, if needed, would probably be bank liquidity. Interest rates and QE could be announced early, but could also be used as a response to economic fallout that might emerge over a longer period.
The ECB's option of riding to the rescue of the likes of Spain or Italy would take some time. They would need to have an economic policy programme agreed with the rest of the eurozone. And Spain in particular, with an election this weekend, is itself in a period of political uncertainty that could make it difficult to conduct international negotiations."

"The Queen's Park Rangers player made his NI debut in March and scored in his second game against Slovenia.
Washington, a postman just four years ago, followed that up with another goal against Belarus on Saturday.
""The last few months have been a crazy time and I don't think it has sunk in yet. I know I have been fortunate,"" said the 24-year-old.
""Football can be about being in the right place at the right time, and I have been lucky.
""Maybe in a couple of years I will look back and realise how mad it has all been.""
Washington  combined representing non-League St Ives between 2010 and 2012 with a job delivering mail.
Having averaged more than a goal-a-game in his 50 appearances for a club in the ninth tier, he then got his break with Newport who paid £5,000 for him.
The Welsh club were promoted to the Football League in his first season, although Washington barely featured.
He then moved to Peterborough in 2014 and by mid-January of this year, when QPR took him from London Road, Washington had scored 15 goals and aroused the interest of Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill.
Washington had only been to the country once before his international bow against Wales in March but he qualified through the grandparent rule.
""It was nice to be accepted so quickly and so readily with Northern Ireland,"" he added.
""Life doesn't get much better. I'm proud of my achievements and just have to try to enjoy it."""
"A merger of the Royal Liverpool and Aintree University hospitals has been proposed in the draft Sustainability and Transformation Plan for Merseyside and Cheshire released on Wednesday.
It aims to address a potential funding gap of £908m in the area by 2021.
Councillor Andy Moorhead said Liverpool City Region ""will not support"" the plan, which was ""completed in secrecy"".
Louise Shepherd, who is chief executive of Alder Hey Children's Hospital and led the work, said the hospitals have been ""talking together for over three years about what they can do better together"".
The hospitals ""said their intention would be to try and bring the two organisations together"", Ms Shepherd said, but ""what that actually means for services is still to be determined"".
The plan suggests merging the Royal, Aintree and Liverpool Women's Hospital into one new trust by April 2018 - but also ""reconfiguring"" the women's hospital by 2021.
""New models of A&E"", which could mean reduced opening hours, are also being considered at Southport and Ormskirk Trust, which runs Southport and Formby Hospital A&E - rated inadequate on Tuesday by the health watchdog.
Mr Moorhead, in charge of health, wellbeing and social care for the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, said ""any decisions by the NHS to reconfigure hospitals"" should ""be the subject of transparent and open debate"" and ""have the support of local communities and NHS staff... this has just not happened"".
Shadow health minister and Labour MP for Ellesmere Port and Neston Justin Madders said the process has been ""completely lacking in transparency and accountability"" and ""mired in confusion"".
NHS England has split the country into 44 geographic areas - called ""footprints"" - each of which must soon produce a five-year sustainability and transformation plan.
Merseyside and Cheshire is the second largest, incorporating Knowsley, Sefton, Liverpool, Halton, St Helens, Cheshire East, Cheshire West and Chester, Warrington, Wirral.
Labour MP for Wallasey Angela Eagle said Wirral seems to be ""particularly hard hit"" and the plan ""seems to be more about meeting the deficit than actually looking at what kind of health services we need"".
The report's publication marks the start of a consultation period during which people will be asked for their opinions."
"Social media videos shot in the Plaza Major showed injured fans and officers in body armour wielding batons.
BBC journalist Phil Mackie confirmed police used baton charges to clear parts of the square.
Earlier, Spanish police said eight Leicester fans were arrested for ""causing a mess"" on Tuesday night.
Footage posted online showed a group of officers being targeted with missiles and fans chanting ""Gibraltar is ours"" in the Plaza Major, where Leicester's fans were told they could congregate.
A witness told BBC 5 live: ""There were a couple of people who probably antagonised the police, but then they took it out all these people here.
""There were people with children, they came in with batons and there was a 70-year-old man and the kids [in the way].""
Owynn Palmer-Atkin, reporting for BBC Radio Leicester, said: ""There was a couple of flares that went off - blue smoke, then a bang, and that is when you heard the tone of the chanting change.
""The noise of the crowd seem to quieten and then become more of a panic.
""There was another bang and that is when the riot vans started charging across the square. I find it incredible a police van would travel that fast in a crowded square.""
BBC presenter Gary Lineker, a Leicester City fan and former Foxes player, tweeted: ""Just saw the footage of some Leicester fans behaving despicably in Madrid. The few idiots ruin it for the decent majority. Sickening..""
On Tuesday night, Phil Mackie said he witnessed what appeared to be an unprovoked attack on supporters.
He reported seeing police charging a group of Leicester fans walking in the city centre before three were pushed to the ground, hit with batons and bundled into the back of vans.
Police said six officers were also attacked in the overnight disturbances.
The eight fans arrested remain in custody and will appear in court on Thursday."
"For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt, but now new research is questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt . For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt, but new research is now questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt. Both federal government regulations and the American Heart Association have for decades warned that excess salt contributes to the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans each year. As the federal government prepares its influential Dietary Guidelines for 2015, some scientists are now saying that the average American salt consumption rate carries no risk. The guidelines currently dictate the people should limit their intake to 2,300 milligrams, with an even stricter 1,500 milligram limit for African Americans and people over 50. In February the  Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended keeping the larger limit, although it withdrew support for the stricter limit for African Americans and people over 50, reports The Washington Post. 'There is no longer any valid basis for the current salt guidelines,' said Andrew Mente, a professor at McMaster University in Ontario and one of the researchers involved in a major study published last year by the New England Journal of Medicine. 'So why are we still scaring people about salt?' While experts on both sides agree that eating too much salt - especially for people with high blood pressure - can be dangerous there is much disagreement over what constitutes too much. The average American ingests about 3,500 milligrams of salt per day - the amount of sodium in a teaspoon of salt - and so under the current dietary guidelines Americans are indeed endangering themselves. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement with at least one former president claiming that there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure . Salt skeptics however believe most Americans are fine. In their view, a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6,000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks. The skeptics also warn of the dangers of consuming too little - they say that below 3,000 milligrams also raises health risks. The PURE study published last August by the New England Journal of Medicine found that people who conform to the recommended limits (2,300 milligrams) actually have more heart trouble. They found that low sodium may stimulate the production of renin, a hormone that may have harmful effects on blood vessels. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement. 'The totality of the evidence strongly suggests that Americans should be lowering their sodium intake,' said Elliott Antman, the president of the American Heart Association. 'Everyone agrees that current sodium intake is too high.' But Suzanne Oparil, a former president of the American Heart Association, told the Post that there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services has said that the federal guidelines are considering comments from the public and the advice of its science panel."
"The Irish student allegedly raped by a Wall St banker in the Hamptons told how she used 'every ounce of strength left inside me' to throw him off whilst he violently assaulted her. The 22-year-old said she kneed Jason Lee, an ex-Goldman Sachs managing director, in the groin during the struggle after he forced her onto the floor whilst naked in the bathroom of his $35,000 a month rented mansion. She sobbed and said she was left in a state of 'disbelief' and begged her friends to take her home - because she felt that it was her fault. The Irish student allegedly raped by Jason Lee, a Wall St banker in the Hamptons told how she used 'every ounce of strength left inside me' to throw him off whilst he violently assaulted her. Pictured: Lee walked hand in hand with his wife Alicia into New York Suffolk County Court on April 8 . The victim also revealed that she has not even told her family back in Ireland about her ordeal and made the 16 hour journey to New York to give evidence on her own, apparently lying to explain why she was in the US. The alleged rape happened in the summer of 2013 when the victim was in America for the summer on a J-1 exchange visa, which is commonly used by young Irish people visiting for a few months. Lee, 38, who is married, has denied first-degree rape, sexual misconduct and third-degree assault and faces up to 25 years in jail if convicted. The victim, who currently works in education, said that she had been working in South Carolina in a frozen yogurt shop for the summer of 2013 and had gone to New York to see this 'big city that everyone talks about'. She came to America to see the 'culture and the people' and when she was in the Hamptons was amazed at 'how cool it was'. Giving evidence the victim, who had her blonde hair pulled back in a ponytail and wore a black and white spotted dress, was visibly distressed and her hands were shaking. Former Goldman Sachs managing director Jason Lee, 38, faces charges of allegedly raping a 20-year-old Irish woman in the Hamptons in August 2013 . When asked to identify Lee she was unable to look him in the eye and welled up in tears. She described how she went to Montauk on Long Island to celebrate with her brother and met Lee and his friend Rene Duncan at the Georgica nightclub in Wainscott after taking a taxi there. The group partied until it closed around 3am, downing glasses of vodka and orange and went back to Lee's for an after party where they drank champagne from the bottle, swam in the pool and ate pizza, the court heard. Recounting the attack, she said that Lee barged into the downstairs bathroom wearing no clothes as she was changing to leave. Initially she was 'laughing' as she thought it was a joke - until Lee forced his way in. She said: 'I fell back and hit my hip and the back of my neck.' Suffolk County prosecutor Kerriann Kelly asked if she was on her back on the floor and the victim said yes. Miss Kelly asked: 'What happened?' The victim paused and struggled to get her words out as she said: 'Um, um, he was on top of me. He had his hands either side of my head'. She then stopped speaking and held up her hands either side of her head to show the court what she meant. The victim said: 'His arms were around my wrists. I struggled. At first I didn't really understand what was happening. I said get off and he didn't. ‘I just couldn't understand when you tell somebody to get off and they don't get off. I started calling my friend. He put his hand over my mouth with the back of his hand.' At Miss Kelly's asking, the victim held the back of her hand to her mouth to show what she meant. The victim said: 'I tried to bite him but I couldn't. He told me to shut the f*** up. He said it twice. He pulled up my dress and pulled down my underwear. I was still struggling, trying to get away.' Miss Kelly asked: 'What happened?' The victim again welled up and paused before saying: 'Um, that's when he, that's when he put his penis inside me'. Miss Kelly asked: 'Did you feel it?' The victim replied: 'Yes. He started going up and down.' Miss Kelly asked: 'We're you struggling?' The victim said: 'Yeah'. Miss Kelly asked: 'We're you crying?' The victim said: 'Yeah' The victim said: 'I used every ounce of strength left inside me to pull up my knee and hit him in the groin. ‘He fell off. I sat there in disbelief and couldn't believe what had happened. I took off the dress as quickly as I could because it was disgusting. I got out of there as quickly as I could.' Lee has denied first-degree rape, sexual misconduct and third-degree assault and could face 25 years in jail if convicted . Asked by Miss Kelly what her emotional state was, the victim said: 'I couldn't even speak. I know I was crying but I wasn't hysterical. I couldn't believe what had happened' The victim was led outside by her friends and told the first police officer on the scene that she had been raped, though she admitted that she did not want to involve the authorities. She said: 'I didn't want anything to do with the police. I just wanted to go home'. 'I felt like it was my fault. I shouldn't have got into the car (at Georgica). I should have gone home.' She described the examination by a nurse later that morning as 'so embarrassing'. She said: 'It was hard, so hard'. In her evidence the victim presented herself as a humble person and said that she thought that Georgica was 'too fancy for us'. The victim said: 'My friend and I thought it was funny that these two men were talking to us. We were just students and we didn't have much to offer. We were out of place'. Asked by Miss Kelly if she ever gave consent to have sex with Lee, the victim replied: 'No'. Miss Kelly asked: 'Did you tell him no?' The victim said: 'Yes'. Miss Kelly said: 'Did you tell him to get off of you?' The victim said: 'Yes’. Lee was a managing director for Goldman Sachs and works at the investment bank's headquarters at 200 West Street in Lower Manhattan. A representative from the company said he left the firm last year . In her evidence the victim also revealed that she had kept her ordeal a secret even from her own parents. Asked by Miss Kelly if she had told them, she said: 'No, nobody at home knows what happened'. The victim said that she had travelled to New York to give evidence on her own and that her brother had wanted to come with her 'so badly' but he couldn't. Under cross examination by Lee's lawyer Andrew Lankler, the victim was shown three photographs taken in Georgica. One showed her draped around Lee with two of her female friends either side of them. Another showed her between Lee and Mr Duncan. A third was a selfie the victim took and showed Lee with his arm around around her and his lips resting on her cheek. In all three she was smiling and appeared happy. She was also shown a picture of the bathroom where she claims she was raped and an image of the scratch on her leg that was caused during the struggle. The house on Clover Leaf Lane in East Hampton, New York, where the sexual assault allegedly occurred . The victim admitted to Mr Lankler that had it not been for her brother insisting she get in the police car, she probably never would have done so. She also said that the attack lasted no more than two minutes. Earlier the court heard from the victim’s best friend who also broke down in tears telling how she came upon her seconds after the assault. The woman said that the victim begged to be taken home as she emerged from a bathroom where Lee allegedly set upon her. The friend the court: 'She looked shaken. She looked scared. There was tears in her eyes. Her eyes were bloodshot.’ Lee was initially placed on leave from Goldman Sachs but last year left the company. His wife Alicia is standing by him and has been at court every day. The trial at Suffolk County Court continues."
"The most popular cities in the world are often instantly recognisable thanks to their world-famous landmarks. But what would these cities look like if they did not have their prized attractions? That's what one studio asked its designers, and the images it received back were certainly illuminating. Scroll down for video . Without the 324m-high Eiffel Tower in Paris, the skyline looks incredibly bare and dark, which is not surprising considering it has 336 lamps illuminating it at night . The iconic tower, on the Champ de Mars, was opened in 1889 and has come to define the French capital . The Arc De Triomphe was constructed in 1806, and is the centrepiece of Place Charles de Gaulle at the end of the Champs-Élysées . The imposing monument celebrates France's military glories and also its military heroes - tourists can climb up tot the roof for beautiful views of Paris . Virtual studio DesignCrowd invited people to submit before and after graphics of some of the most well known landscapes as we have never seen them before. Nearly 100 submissions have been created, with a number of them focusing on the 300m-high Eiffel Tower in their creations . The startling absence of the giant tower left the landscape feeling bare and flat, although it did allow for views from the Trocadéro Gardens, through to the Champ de Mars. More missing features in Paris included the impressive Arc De Triomphe. Instead of leading to the famous centrepiece, the multiple surrounding roads meet at a bare, round circle. Without the Statue of Liberty to draw boats of tourists, Liberty Island looks forlorn and barren. All that remains of the island is the paved stone where the iconic colossal neoclassical sculpture stood. The Statue of Liberty draws boats of tourists every day, but without the iconic lady, Liberty Island looks nothing special . Siena Cathedral is a medieval church in Siena, Italy that has been around since 1215. Its spires and towers peek over the city . The River Thames looks just like any other river with the elegant Tower Bridge stretching across the waterway . The iconic Tower Bridge is featured in nearly every London tourist shop and often mistakenly referred to by visitors as London Bridge . Designers imaged what London would look like without its most photographed clocktower and Westminster Palace . The Palace of Westminster is more commonly known as the Houses of Parliament, with both the House of Commons and House of Lords based in the Gothic-style waterfront building . London's attractions draw millions of tourists every year, but there would be a lot less photographs taken in the city if Big Ben was not a feature on the skyline. It is said to be the most photographed clock in the world, and would not be easy to remove, sitting at over 13 tons. The sunset skyline looks empty without the impressive architecture of the Palace of Westminster. The banks of River Yamuna, in Agra, look desolate with the majestic presence of the Taj Mahal . The Taj Mahal is a striking white marble mausoleum in Agra, and brings millions of tourists to the surrounding area . A certain Holy presence is missing from the skyline of Rio de Janeiro, making the normally instantly-recognisable city a little more mysterious . Christ the Redeemer overlooks all the goings on in Rio, and makes the city instantly recognisable . The Sydney Harbour stands out due to its uniquely designed opera house, which resembles the sails of a ship, without it the skyline looks like any other cluster of skyscrapers . The beautiful monastery carved out of red rock in Petra, Jordan, was originally part of a Nabataean . The rose-red Petra is Jordan's most prized tourist attraction, and hopefully, being a UNESCO World Heritage Site, will never disappear . Machu Picchu was only rediscovered by western travellers in 1911, leading to the site being excavated and becoming a tourist attraction . The ruins at the Inca settlement of Machu Picchu in Peru have made the area a bucket list favourite . Niagara Falls without the falls is a dry, barren hole, and would not attract the 12 million annual visitors it does today . On the border of the US and Canada, Niagara Falls is actually made up of three separate waterfalls . The designs also featured landmarks outside of typical city backdrops. Without the tumbling 51-metre-high Niagara Falls, the area left behind would not pull the 12 million annual visitors that it sees every year. While the Andes are an incredible sight by themselves, iconic pictures with the ruins at the Incan settlement of Machu Picchu, have made the area a bucket list favourite. Standing at 68m, the Obelisk of Buenos Aires would be missed from the urban landscape behind if it were removed . The Four Face Sculptures of late Presidents on Mount Rushmore have vanished, leaving behind just another normal rockface . Mount Rushmore would be unrecognisable without the presidential presence which has been in place since the carvings were completed between 1934 and 1939 ."
"Bricks were thrown and fires lit outside Stratford bus station and Forest Gate police station in London.
Protesters allege Edir Frederico Da Costa, 25, was ""brutally beaten"" by Met Police officers earlier this month.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating the treatment of Mr Da Costa, who died six days after he was stopped by police.
Borough Commander Supt Ian Larnder stood in the middle of a group of protesters trying to answer their questions and calm tensions.
One protester rode his motorbike up to the police line and revved his engine in front of officers.
Another motorcyclist turned his bike towards the officers and span his wheels so smoke blew towards them.
Firefighters, protected by police, hosed out a fire which had been started in a bin in Richmond Road. Bins were also set alight near a McDonald's in Romford Road.
Bricks had been ripped from a wall and thrown at police.
Family campaigners said the violence was not coming from them and it had been set up as a peaceful march.
The police said there had been no arrests but some officers suffered minor injuries.
The force added that the number of protesters was starting to dwindle just before 23:00.
Mr Da Costa, known by friends as Edson, died on 21 June, six days after being stopped in a car in Woodcocks, Beckton, in Newham, east London.
Campaigners claim that his neck was broken and he suffered head and other injuries after he was stopped in a car, containing three people, by Met officers.
The IPCC said a preliminary post-mortem examination, carried out on Thursday, indicated there were no spinal injuries caused by police.
Transport for London said that from just before 18:00 there had been ""a number of bus diversions at police request"" due to the demonstration at Stratford."

"Model-turned-jihadist Sharky Jama has reportedly been killed in Syria while fighting with terrorist organisation Islamic State (IS). The Melbourne man's father, Dada Jama, confirmed his death to SBS Radio while tributes to the young man flooded social media. Somali broadcaster Ibrahim Mohamed said he had spoken with the family on Wednesday who told him Sharky had died after being shot. Scroll down for video . Sharky Jama has reported been shot dead in Syria after joining Islamic State on the front lines last year . The jihadist's father had been told by Sharky's friends that the worst had happened. '[Dada] got a text message and he received a phone call from Syria, someone has told him his son has passed away,' Mr Mohamed said. 'Then he said ""I tried his number"", because he has contact with his son. Automatically, it goes to voicemail, that’s what he said, and then he knew that his son is gone.' The Department of Foreign Affairs was unable to confirm Sharky's death as its capacity to do so was 'extremely limited'. A spokesman for the department told Daily Mail Australia consular assistance was no longer available within Syria 'due to the extremely dangerous security situation'. He further added Australians who were involved in overseas conflicts were 'putting their own lives in mortal danger'. 'Any Australians fighting with non-state militia in Syria or Iraq should end their involvement in the conflict now and leave the conflict zone,' the spokesman said. 'Australians are strongly advised not to travel to Syria or Iraq; any Australians in either country should leave immediately.' Sharky was a model-turned-jihadist who was managed by FRM Management and lived in Melbourne . He reportedly fled to Syria with his friend, former La Trobe University student Yusuf Yusuf, to join the terror group . The former model's cousins have taken to Facebook to pay tribute to their much-loved family member. 'To my beautiful cousin, the lessons learnt in your presence where priceless in any capacity the childhood memories we shared invaluable you'll be greatly missed for you where great in every shade of light,' they said. While another relative wrote: 'Rest in peace my handsome lil cousin! All them beautiful memories and time we shared I shall keep dear to my heart. May Allah bless your soul.' His family were informed of his death on Monday and father Dada Jama told SBS Radio he had been told of news via a text message and phone call . His cousins posted tributes to their much-loved relative on social media, saying he was 'beautiful' Before he joined IS, Sharky was a 'budding' model with FRM Management. Reports the Melbourne man of Somalian descent had fled to Syria to join the front lines first surfaced last year. It is believed Sharky and his friend, former La Trobe University student Yusuf Yusuf, had travelled to key IS outposts of Fallujah, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, respectively. In various pictures published by his modelling agency, Sharky is seen posing for photographs in smart casual clothing. Propaganda prop: Abdullah Elmir, 17, from western Sydney, featured in a high-definition Islamic State broadcast earlier this year . Elmir, pictured, has not been heard from in IS propaganda since the video's syndication . Islamic State has been heavily recruiting young Australians to come to the Middle East via online videos . In a series of professional photographs, he is seen showing off high-topped leather boots, cargo pants and a colourful scarf on a picturesque Australian beach. In other pictures, he gazes down the barrel of the camera, a patterned fedora tipped forward on his head as he saunters down a laneway wearing a short-sleeve dress shirt and pants. Sharky's marketing card describes his chest, waist and collar measurements as well as his height (5'11""), suit size (38R) and shoe size (10.5). It is not known what role the young Australian played in Fallujah - the first major city to fall to the Islamic State in 2014, but there is no doubt it was very different to his Australian occupation. The Federal Government believes more than 70 Australians have fled to join the fighting in Iraq and Syria and the passports of more than 100 others have been cancelled. Other young Australians who have fled to Syria include Sydney teenager Abdullah Elmir who recently appeared in an Islamic State recruitment video."
"Nurseries increasingly focus on plants that can be mass produced so the big stores can sell them cheaply, he says.
""You have these vast wholesale nurseries now supplying supermarkets - and that's a diminution of choice,"" he told Radio 4's You and Yours.
However, the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) says supermarket sales actually help grow the market.
According to Kantar World Panel, nearly 40% of gardeners get their plants, bulbs and seeds from supermarkets.
""That's bad,"" says Don. ""It's rather like the vast suppliers supplying food - you get lots and lots of the same thing mass produced to be as cheap as possible.""
The UK garden market is worth around Â£5bn, with some Â£1.4bn spent on garden plants by UK consumers in 2013, according to the HTA, the industry body.
The Gardeners' World presenter believes consumers should shop around.
""I'm a huge fan of independent nurseries. That is where you get the expertise, it's where you will find people who have devoted their life to growing something.
""They will grow geraniums or trees and they will really know about it, so when you contact them, they can give you great help and assistance.""
Martin Simmons, HTA director of operations, said: ""People often make impulse purchases of plants in supermarkets and if this then encourages them to buy more plants then this is good for the industry and helps to grow the market.
""Buying a plant in a supermarket may be the first step for some consumers, particularly younger ones. If this grabs their interest they will naturally seek out garden centres and retail nurseries.""
Waitrose told the BBC it took quality seriously, and that its plants were supplied by two reputable nurseries who supply only garden centres - not other supermarkets.
Inviting Monty Don for a visit to talk to buyers, Asda said it works with a network of expert growers to ensure it offered quality.
Sainsbury's said it had a longstanding relationship with suppliers, many of whom were family businesses. It added that it always worked to give customers choice and value.

The deal will now be put to a ballot of the union's membership.
Up to 10,000 prison officers in England and Wales protested last month over claims of a ""surge"" in jail violence.
They stopped work over claims of a ""surge in violence"" in jails but returned to work after a High Court injunction ordered them to end their 24-hour protest.
Under the agreement, prison officers will be allowed to retire at 65 - up to three years ahead of the current state pension age - at no cost to them and with full pension benefits.
Uniformed staff will also be given consolidated pay rises of between 0.5% and 1% for each of the next three years, on top of usual performance-related pay increases.
They also stand to receive a ""recognition and retention"" package totalling Â£1,000.
Prisons minister Sam Gyimah, said the government and POA had also ""agreed a significant number of health and safety reforms as well as new powers for governors in terms of how they deploy their staff in prisons"".
The POA directed members to take action last month after talks with the government over health and safety concerns broke down.
It came after multiple high-profile incidents at prisons across England.
In October, Jamal Mahmoud, an inmate at HMP Pentonville, died after being stabbed to death in an attack at the prison, which left two others injured.
And last month prisoners caused almost Â£1m of damage during a riot at Bedford prison.
Days later at HMP Isle of Wight, an inmate cut a prison officer's throat with a razor blade on the way back to his cell.
In an effort to tackle safety issues Justice Secretary Liz Truss unveiled proposals detailing Â£1.3bn investment in new prisons over the next five years, including plans for 2,100 extra prison officers, drug tests for inmates on entry and exit from prisons, and more autonomy for governors.
In response to the new pay deal she said: ""This agreement is a good offer which rightly recognises the hard work and dedication of officers across the country doing a tough job."""
"The robot sucked the air into its big Sample Analysis at Mars (Sam) instrument to reveal the concentration of different gases.
The Sam analysis is ongoing but no major surprises are expected at this stage - carbon dioxide will dominate.
CO2 is the chief component of the Martian air, as found by the Viking probes in the 1970s and the Phoenix lander in 2008.
Of keener interest will be whether a signal for methane has been detected by Curiosity.
The gas has recently been observed by satellite and by Earth telescopes, and its presence on the Red Planet is intriguing.
Methane should be short-lived and its persistence suggests a replenishing source of some kind - either biological or geochemical.  It is hoped Sam can shed light on the issue.
The results from this first test could be announced next week, said Curiosity deputy principal scientist Joy Crisp, but she cautioned that it would be some time before definitive statements could be made about the status of methane on Mars.
""When Sam is at its best it can measure various parts per trillion of methane, and the expected amounts based on measurements taken from orbit around Mars and from Earth telescopes should be in the 10 to a few 10s of parts per billion,"" she told reporters.
""But it's so early in the use of Sam, which is a complicated instrument, and we have to sort through the data.""
Curiosity - also known as the Mars Science Laboratory, MSL - has now driven more than 100m from the location on the floor of Gale Crater where it landed a month ago.
A new picture from the overflying Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) spacecraft shows its progress.
""You can see the rover with the white deck on top and the black wheels, and you can see our tracks behind us,"" explained mission manager Mike Watkins.
""We're about a football field or so away from the touch-down point - from Bradbury Landing.""
Curiosity is heading to a point dubbed Glenelg by scientists.
This is about 300m further to the east from its current position.  Satellite pictures point to Glenelg being an intersection of three distinct types of rock terrain. Researchers think it will be a good place to start to characterise the geology of Gale Crater.
The rover's arrival at the junction is still some weeks away, however.
Engineers have parked the vehicle for a few days to practise using the 2m-long robotic arm. This carries a 30kg tool turret on its end and the mission team needs to learn how to move the device in the weaker gravity conditions that exist on Mars.
""Mars has about 38% of Earth gravity,"" said Matt Robinson, the lead engineer on Curiosity's arm.
""Under Earth gravity, the arm sags to a certain position. On Mars, if you were to command the arm to the exact same joint angles, the turret would be at a higher position than it was on Earth.
""To compensate, we have flight software that does the mathematics to position the arm lower to recreate the exact same pose of the turret with respect to the hardware on the rover.
""So a big part of this exercise is to verify that flight software is doing that compensation properly,"" he told BBC News.
Once the arm check-out is done, Curiosity will pick up the pace to get to Glenelg.
En route, the rover will watch for an early opportunity to test its turret instruments on a rock.
This will involve putting the ""hand lens"" known as Mahli (Mars Hand Lens Imager) close to the test object.
Mahli is essentially a close-up camera that can resolve rock minerals down to the size of a grain of talcum powder.
The other turret instrument engineers want to see in action is APXS, an X-ray spectrometer that can determine the abundance of chemical elements in rocks.
Also in line to make its debut soon is the turret's scoop mechanism (Collection and Handling for Interior Martian Rock Analysis, or Chimra). The robot arm will pick up a sample of soil and deliver it to the labs inside the rover body for analysis.

"Cheshire is home to major employers in science and manufacturing, housing developers are eager - some would say too eager - to build new homes, and it could soon have two high-speed rail stations.
The presence of the Northern Powerhouse's chief architect, Chancellor George Osborne, as the MP for Tatton, means there is the will within Whitehall for Cheshire to benefit from devolution.
The Powerhouse allows Cheshire companies ""to be part of something far greater"", according to Cygnet Group chief executive Matthew Kimpton-Smith.
His Northwich firm sells specialist machinery, predominantly to China and the United States. He says the Northern Powerhouse gives his company ""real power, real punch"" on the world stage.
But Cheshire has been beaten in the race to take on devolved powers.
Officials have had to watch as devolution deals were done with the noisy neighbours in Manchester and Liverpool. They've even lost territory as the Cheshire borough of Halton decided to become part of the Liverpool city region.
Over the summer, anxious to avoid being left behind, the two councils in the east and west of Cheshire, plus Warrington, hurriedly put together their own devolution bid to meet a tight government timetable.
Warrington Borough Council's chief executive Steven Broomhead, who used to run the Northwest Regional Development Agency, said the bid wouldn't just ""enhance and grow"" the county's economy - it would allow the borough to escape the influence of its neighbours' elected mayors.
But as city regions have so far been the only places to have agreed deals, there's a lack of clarity over what a Cheshire deal might look like.
It seems so unclear that the leader of Warrington Borough Council, Terry O'Neill, recently said his authority wasn't sure whether devolution would be ""a poisoned chalice or an opportunity"".
A report by the think tank IPPR North seems to acknowledge this, calling for ""greater clarification of the purpose, process and timescale"" of devolution deals for counties.
It's also not clear whether the government will insist on a Cheshire elected mayor.
Until there are firm answers to questions like those, the county's Powerhouse ambitions may just be held back."
"The polls would have been the first electoral contest between the rival Fatah and Hamas movements for 10 years.
Their delay was ordered after lists of candidates for Fatah, which dominates the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, were cancelled in parts of the Gaza Strip, which is run by Hamas.
Hamas has protested at the court's ruling, describing it as ""political"".
Fatah said it held Hamas fully responsible.
Thursday's ruling by the high court in the West Bank city of Ramallah came after a Hamas-controlled court in Gaza disqualified several candidate lists drawn up by Fatah on technical grounds.
A challenge was also lodged by a lawyer over the inability to hold the vote in East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after seizing it in the 1967 war but Palestinians want to be the capital of a future state.
""Elections can't take place in one place and not the other,"" said the presiding judge.
""The elections can't take place in Jerusalem and its neighbourhoods. Also, there are problems with the formation of courts in Gaza... Therefore, the court decides to stop the elections.""
Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri blamed Fatah for the delay.
""The high court decision is politically motivated and it came in order to rescue Fatah after its lists of candidates collapsed in a number of areas,"" he told the Reuters news agency.
But Osama al-Qawasmi of Fatah rejected the allegation, saying: ""We hold Hamas fully responsible for foiling the election, starting with the unjustified petitions it filed.""
The election would have been the first involving Hamas and Fatah since the 2006 poll for the Palestinian Legislative Council, in which Hamas won a majority.
A violent rift with Fatah saw the Islamist movement take control of Gaza the following year.
Although Fatah and Hamas formally agreed a unity deal and a technocratic government in 2014, deep divisions remain, resulting in political paralysis."
"A photographer has captured dozens of Elvis impersonators as they gathered at some of Europe's biggest tributes to The King. Graeme Oxby documented the dedicated fans at events including Europe's Tribute to Elvis in Blackpool, The Elvis Weekender in Bridlington, East Riding of Yorskshire, and The European Elvis Championships in Birmingham. The 50-year-old, from East Yorkshire, even visited their homes to capture images for his photo series, called 'The Kings of England'. He said: 'Elvis was a unique phenomenon, the prototype superstar and his influence has spread far and wide. 'Britain is the European centre for Elvis tribute activity and hosts of the biggest and best contests in the world. The fans I met were in mainly quite old although, there's a new generation of people discovering the music of the King. 'I hope to show the colour, the razzmatazz and the fun of the Elvis Tribute world. Elvis was a one off but all around Europe, and to varying degrees of success, men women and even children are paying tribute to a remarkable performer and cultural phenomenon, having a good time in the process.' A selection of his work is on a UK gallery tour until 2017, ans is currently on show at The Cooper in Barnsley, South Yorkshire.

"Clay Aiken, the loser in a November contest to represent the Second District of North Carolina in Congress, uncorked some show-biz venom Monday on the election's winner, Rep. Renee Ellmers. 'She's a b**ch!' Aiken told SiriusXM radio host Howard Stern, discussing his Esquire Network documetary program that chronicles his failed bid for a seat in the House of Representatives. The show is called 'The Runner-Up,' a reference both to ths election and to his second-place finish in the second season of American Idol. American Idol runner-up and congressional election runner-up Clay Aiken body-slammed Rep. Renee Ellmers on Monday's Howard Stern Show, calling her a 'b**ch' and an 'idiot' Ellmers, an intensive-care nurse by training, beat a seven-term incumbent in 2010 and won a third term by crushing Aiken in November . Ellmers, an intensive-care nurse who married a surgeon, plays an unwitting part in the show. 'She’s an idiot,' said Aiken, 36. 'And I think her self-esteem is just in the floor. Under the floor.' The 51-year-old congresswoman captured 58.8 per cent of the vote on her way to a third term, compared with Aiken's 41.2 per cent. He won the Democratic primary when his chief rival, businessman Keith Crisco, died suddenly after a fall. Crisco was a former state secretary of commerce and a political veteran. Aiken is sketching out a second political life on the small screen, and lobbed some publicity for his show at Stern's gigantic audience – along with some slaps at Ellmers. 'You should see the second episode, because she’s a bitch,' he said during the interview. A spokeswoman for Ellmers scoffed at Aiken, telling Daily Mail Online that his 'crude language and disrespectful demeanor towards the congresswoman has proven to the American people why he is a runner up.' Aiken doesn't much seem to care. He's already planning the third act in his political play, telling Stern that he's planning a future bid for elective office. MISSED IT BY THAT MUCH: Aiken conceded the race to Ellmers in November after she shellacked him by a nearly 18-point margin . 'Within the next decade I will [run] again,' he said. But 'not right now. Probably before six years.' Aiken, who is openly gay, also dove deep into his love life, telling Stern how hard he found it to date in New York City. He said he has stayed away from anonymous hookup apps like Grindr, insisting that he's 'not as much of a whore as people would like to think.' It seems Aiken picks his paramours from among men who friend him on Facebook. 'Here’s the honest truth: When people friend me – God, I'm goign to admit this to people – when people friend me, if it’s a guy who’s really cute, I’ll accept him,' he said. 'And then I’ll look at the pictures.' Suddenly realizing that he had unleashed a flood of male admirers who might stalk him on social media, Aiken let out a shriek, and shouted: 'S**t!' Stern's producers wrote an editorial note on his website Monday afternoon, discouraging the practice. 'DO NOT send Clay a friend request now – after today's interview he is no longer accepting Facebook friend requests for dates!' the warning read. Howard Stern, a shock-jock radio host with a broad following, asked Aiken about his Esquire Network show and his taste in men . TWO-TIME LOSER: Aiken placed second to Ruben Studdard (right) in 2003 in the second season of the American Idol talent-search show . Aiken insisted that he's skilled at screening out people who are only interested in him for his fame. 'My bulls**t detector is pretty f**king good,' he claimed. He also complained about a former boyfriend, a law profesor, who left him high and dry. 'He was an Aires, and he's flightly. ... Gay men are flighty as hell,' Aiken said. 'Who the f**k breaks up with Clay Aiken?' The Hill was first to report Aiken's on-air swipe at Ellmers."
"Stars have flocked to Twitter to praise Tom Hanks' wife Rita Wilson for revealing that she was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and has undergone a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. The 58-year-old actress, who took a leave of absence from Broadway play 'Fish in the Dark' earlier this month, shared the news  through a statement published by People magazine on Tuesday. Following her announcement, famous friends passed on their best wishes to the actress as Katie Couric wrote: 'Sending the wonderful Rita Wilson my love and best wishes for a speedy recovery and good health.' Scroll down for video . By her side: Rita Wilson, who is married to Tom Hanks (pictured together in February), announced on Tuesday that she was recently diagnosed with cancer and has undergone a double mastectomy . Christiana Amanpour added: 'Wishing my good friend @RitaWilson the best as she makes this important announcement, which will help millions of women and their families.' Actress Christina Applegate, who underwent a double mastectomy in 2008, also tweeted: ‘Sweet beautiful powerful Rita!!! Loving you so much!’ Singer Sara Bareilles wrote: ‘Beautiful Brave Friend. Thinking of you and grateful for your courage.’ While reality star Lisa Rinna wrote: ‘Sending love + light to @RitaWilson thank you for Sharing your breast cancer story of getting a second opinion your courage will help many.’ 'Sending all my love to the brave and beautiful @RitaWilson,' Josh Groban tweeted. Best wishes: TV presenter Katie Couric, who is a spokeswoman for colon cancer awareness following the death of her first husband, John Monahan, was one of the first stars to react on social media . Support: Celebrity friends flocked to Twitter to pass their best wishes to the actress after her announcement . In her statement, Rita explained that her first test for cancer came back negative but that she was correctly diagnosed after seeking a second opinion and underwent the procedure last week. 'Last week, with my husband by my side, and with the love and support of family and friends, I underwent a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction for breast cancer after a diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma,' she said in the statement. 'I am recovering and most importantly, expected to make a full recovery. Why? Because I caught this early, have excellent doctors and because I got a second opinion.' Before the diagnosis, Wilson said she had 'vigilantly monitored' her health with mammograms and MRIs because she knew she had an underlying condition of LCIS, (lobular carcinoma in situ)'. Thankful: CNN host Christiane Amanpour noted how Wilson's statement will help future families . Brave: The star from the TV, film and music industries all praised her brave decision . Treatment: Wilson, pictured last year, said she underwent two  breast biopsies before she was diagnosed . The mother-of-two explained that she recently underwent a breast biopsy, but no sign of cancer was discovered until she sought the opinion of a second doctor on the advice of a friend. The doctor discovered the cancer and she then sought out the opinion of another pathologist, who confirmed the diagnosis, she said. Rita, who married Oscar-winner Tom in 1988, went on to implore others to seek a second opinion before thanking her loved ones for their support. 'I share this to educate others that a second opinion is critical to your health,' she said. 'You have nothing to lose if both opinions match up for the good, and everything to gain if something that was missed is found, which does happen. Early diagnosis is key.' On Facebook on Tuesday, she encouraged other women to seek a 'necessary and vital' second opinion if they found themselves in similar situations. 'Not just by another doctor but by another pathologist,' she added. 'I'm doing well and getting stronger every day.' Advice: She shared the news on Facebook and linked to a statement printed by People magazine. Her cancer was not found in the first round of tests so she encourgaed others to seek a second opinion, like she did . Wilson released the statement on Tuesday after it was announced earlier this month that she had temporarily left the Broadway play, written by and starring Larry David. At the time, a spokesperson said Wilson was expected to return to the stage on May 5. While on medical leave, she has been replaced by Glenne Headly. Wilson is also known as the mother of Marnie, played by Allison Williams, in HBO's 'Girls'. She has two sons with Hanks, Chester Marlon, 24, and Truman Theodore, 19, as well as two stepchildren from Hanks' previous marriage - actor Colin Hanks, 37, and writer Elizabeth, 32 - to whom Wilson is close. Hanks and their mother, Samantha Lewes, had met in college but divorced in 1987, the year before he married Wilson. Lewes passed away in 2002, when she was just 49, after battling bone cancer. Wilson's message to other women to get screened comes just days after Taylor Swift revealed her mother, Andrea, had been diagnosed with cancer. She also urged her fans to remind their parents to get checked. Family: Wilson is pictured with Hanks and one of their sons, Chester, in December 2011. The couple has two sons together and Hanks is also father to a daughter and son from his first marriage . Invasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that starts in the milk-producing glands of the breast and spreads in a web-like manner. Due to this, it does not typically form a lump, as is expected with breast cancer, and instead causes a thickening of the tissue, making one part of the breast feel fuller than other areas. Other symptoms including a change in the texture of appearance of the skin on the breast, such as dimpling, or an inverted nipple. Women with this type of breast cancer are usually a few years older than women diagnosed with other types, and it is more likely to occur in both breasts compared with other types. The cancer is invasive, which means it has the potential to spread to other parts of the body. It can be found through screening tests including physical exams or mammograms. Mammograms are encouraged yearly when a woman turns 40s or earlier if they have a family history of breast cancer. Treatment includes removing part or all of the breast followed by chemotherapy or radiation. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 180,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer each year, and about one in ten cases are invasive lobular carcinomas. The earlier the diagnosis, the better the prognosis. Patients have a slightly better outlook for both short- and long-term survival compared to other types of breast cancer. According to a study by Breast Cancer Research, the five-year survival rate is 85 per cent."

"Criticism: Lord Prescott suggested the signatories were 'tax dodgers, Tory donors and non doms' Labour was at war with business again last night as the party lashed out at 120 bosses who warned the economic recovery could be wrecked if it regained power. Shadow Cabinet ministers branded the industry leaders who signed an open letter backing the Conservative economic plan as members of the ‘1 per cent’. Lord Prescott, an adviser to Ed Miliband, went further, suggesting the signatories were ‘tax dodgers, Tory donors and non doms’ – even though several were former Labour supporters. Business spokesman Chuka Umunna raised the stakes, suggesting that one, former Diageo boss Paul Walsh, should no longer take over as the head of the CBI. Mr Umunna said it would be ‘untenable’ for Mr Walsh to ‘claim to be independent in the light of this’. In a highly unusual intervention just weeks from the election, 103 corporate leaders yesterday declared that the Government ‘has been good for business and has pursued policies which have supported investment and job creation’. Throughout the day, 17 more added their names, including the bosses of AstraZeneca, Citi Private Bank and Pirelli. ‘We believe a change in course will threaten jobs and deter investment. This would send a negative message about Britain and put the recovery at risk,’ they said. Attack: Labour's business spokesman Chuka Umunna (left) suggested that former Diageo boss Paul Walsh (right) should no longer take over as the head of the CBI . Involved: Some 103 corporate leaders yesterday declared that the Government ‘has been good for business’. Throughout the day, 17 more added their names, including the bosses of AstraZeneca (above) and Pirelli . Together, the businesses the executives run employ more than 600,000 people, and include brands such as Primark, Iceland, Pizza Express, Mothercare, Ocado, Moonpig, Ted Baker, Costa Coffee and LK Bennett. Executives at consumer brands such as Cobra beer, Britvic, Silver Spoon, Kingsmill, Thorntons, Robinsons, Tango and London Pride also put their names to the list. Chancellor: George Osborne said  Labour’s pledge to raise the main rate of corporation tax to 21p represented 'a huge risk to the British economy' Labour MPs’ attempts to brand them all fat cats were undermined by the fact that the signatories included 29 heads of firms with fewer than 250 employees. Some had supported Labour at previous elections. George Osborne said Tories were offering ‘business stability’, while Labour’s pledge to raise the main rate of corporation tax to 21p represented ‘a huge risk to the British economy and to British jobs’. The Chancellor said: ‘Corporation tax is the main tax on business. Increase it and you increase the tax on investment, on growth and on jobs. It is as simple as that.’ And he said there were ‘just 36 days left to save Britain’s economic recovery’. An Ipsos Mori poll of FTSE 100 leaders suggests 86 per cent will back the Conservatives. Under Tony Blair, 55 per cent backed Labour. Veteran Labour MP Barry Sheerman claimed the letter indicated a ‘clear decline in British political life’, accusing the businesspeople of endorsing ‘right-wing policies that benefit them’. Last night Labour released its own list of names, backing a ‘Labour Government to put working people first’. It included dozens of workers who are on zero-hours contracts as well as advertising chief Trevor Beattie, fashion designer Wayne Hemingway and former Blue Peter presenter Peter Duncan. Embarrassingly for Labour, the list of business leaders features several who supported the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. They include Sir Charles Dunstone, chairman of Dixons Carphone and Talk Talk, who signed a letter backing Labour in 2005. Yo! Sushi founder Simon Woodroffe appeared in a 2004 Labour broadcast. He said: ‘To change now, half way through a recovery from the worst recession we have had in my lifetime seems to be a madness. You need to get behind the people doing the job.’ Other former Labour supporters who signed the letter included: Surinder Arora, described as a ‘big fan’ of Tony Blair in 2007; Dragons’ Den star Duncan Bannatyne, who unveiled a ‘seaside manifesto’ with Gordon Brown before the 2010 election; Sir Cameron Mackintosh, who made a donation to Labour in 1998’; and Moni Varma, who signed a letter to the Financial Times before the 2005 election backing Labour.

"Shocking: Nyia Parler, 41, was taken into custody by authorities in Montgomery County, Maryland overnight Saturday on charges she wheeled her quadriplegic son into woods in Philadelphia then went to visit her boyfriend . A Philadelphia mother accused of abandoning her quadriplegic son in the woods before skipping town to see her boyfriend has been arrested. Nyia Parler, 41, was taken into custody by authorities in Montgomery County, Maryland overnight Saturday on charges including aggravated assault, simple assault and neglect of a care-dependent person. Police say she traveled to Maryland from Pennsylvania either last Sunday or Monday after leaving her 21-year-old wheelchair-bound son in a wooded park with nothing but a blanket and a Bible. Parler's son, who is non-verbal and suffers from cerebral palsy, was found on Friday night lying beneath a rain-soaked blanket and a pile of leaves on the ground, 10 feet from his wheelchair and the Bible. Officials said the son, who has not been identified, would have died if he had not been spotted by people walking on a nearby road, reports NBC Philadelphia. 'This kid is obviously a fighter. It's just unbelievable how we found him last night. It's just heartbreaking to see how another human, especially a mother, could treat him like that,' Lt. John Walker of Philadelphia Police told ABC. Scroll down for video... Arrested: Police say Parler went to Montgomery County to visit her boyfriend after abandoning the non-verbal 21-year-old in the woods . Horrific: The quadriplegic man was found here on the floor of a secluded woodland outside Philadelphia with this Bible and this blanket, 10 feet from his wheelchair. He'd allegedly been left there by his mother five days earlier . The son was hospitalized with dehydration, malnutrition, a cut to his back and eye injuries. According to Philly.com two of his aunts, who are with him in hospital, have been trying to obtain guardianship for years. Parler's other son, a 16-year-old, is said to be in the custody of an aunt. A neighbor, who declined to be identified, told DailyMail.com: 'She used to push him out to the school bus in his wheelchair, she seemed to care for him. Whenever I saw him, I saw her.' Another, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I would see them outside together in the summer when he got home from school. Nothing looked wrong, I didn't suspect anything.' Walker said the son was exposed to the elements and other dangers. 'A lot of things could have happened out there,' he said. Abandoned: A passerby noticed the 21-year-old here in a wooded Philadelphia park . 'Obviously he's in the middle of a wooded area. You have wild animals there ... this kid could not defend himself. He does not function at all.' Walker added : 'What we've learned so far is that the 21-year-old child lives with his mother, completely dependent on mom as a result of his condition. 'She also has a 16-year-old son who is staying with other family members. 'We know she left for Maryland on Monday to go see her boyfriend on a bus.' The man had been reported missing from class at Philadelphia's School Of The Future on Monday. However, when a teacher called Parler she told them they were both in Maryland and he was well. Rescuers used flashlights to find the non-verbal in the East Lansdowne area of Philadelphia on Friday night .

"Membership of the Labour Party has soared since the general election and Mr Corbyn believes most of these new members are his supporters.
The hope of his opponents is that many may have become disillusioned with his leadership.
But having spent a day in Leeds meeting new and older members of the local party, I found scant evidence for this.
If anything, Mr Corbyn's supporters seem ever more determined to defend him.
So who are these new members; the so called ""Corbynistas""?
I spent time with four of them: Jane Ingham , 65, a retired head teacher, Ged Colgan, 26, a hotel worker, Marvina Newton, 30, a local charity manager and Jane Aitchison, who is in her 40s and is a trade unionist.
What quickly became clear was that, not only was Jeremy Corbyn the main reason they joined the Labour Party, but they remain fiercely loyal to him.
Mr Corbyn, they believe, offers inspiration and change.  In the past Labour had become too similar to the Conservatives; particularly over austerity, they say.
Jeremy Corbyn represented a break with the traditional way of doing politics
""He's unlike anyone,"" says Marvina. ""To me that's what is great about him. He speaks from the heart. ""
What was also clear was the disdain all four had for those Labour MPs seemingly determined to oppose Jeremy Corbyn.
""Unfortunately they have been part of a style of politics that has not only failed to win elections but they have been consistently wrong about a whole range of issues,"" says Ged.
Jane the retired head teacher is similarly unimpressed.
""I'm quite disappointed with the MPs. Do too many of them have too many privileges and just enjoy the privilege of being members of Parliament?""
And there's no disguising the fact these new members are prepared for a fight should Labour MPs continue to refuse to back Mr Corbyn, if he wins this leadership contest.
No-one mentions the D-word, deselection. But the warning signs are clear.
""It's perfectly legitimate for local members to choose who they want to be their candidate at the next election,"" warns Ged. ""I don't see why being an MP should be treated like a job for life.""
Jane, the trade unionist, agrees.
""They (the MPs) do feel threatened. We represent change and Jeremy represents huge change and that threatens their very cosy position.""
So what of longer-serving party members? How do they view this influx of pro-Corbyn new members ?
Away from the city centre in one of Leeds' more deprived areas, Seacroft, a rock-solid Labour area, I met up with two long-standing party members: Les Wrigglesworth, a former miner, and Melvyn Burton.
They both praise the energy and enthusiasm of the new recruits.
However they are more cautious over how committed these new members will remain to the Labour Party.
Les says they may prove ""fair weather"" members.
They are both dismissive, however, of claims that many of the new members are so-called ""entryists"" from Trotskyite and other hard-left groups.
Les dismisses the idea as a ""red herring"". There may be a few entryists, he says, but only a tiny minority.
Melvyn believes the new members may be ""naive"" in their views but they are not Trotskyists.
It's only a snap shot but my impression is that even those party members who are not supporters of Jeremy Corbyn are far from happy about the challenge to his leadership.
Some regard it as a distraction from the business of opposing the Conservatives; others as undemocratic; others still as a precursor to a possible all-out civil war or even split in the party.
The difficulty is that Mr Corbyn has become the sticking point.
Many Labour MPs believe he threatens Labour's very survival as a credible political party.
But if they are hoping the membership is poised to turn against him - I found precious little sign of it in Leeds."
"Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta is confident it will take just 'five minutes' to put the finishing touches to a contract extension once he is fully fit and back in the squad. The 33-year-old Spaniard is set to miss Saturday's FA Cup semi-final against Reading at Wembley as he recovers from a minor ankle problem picked up on his return to action with the Under 21s following a calf injury which sidelined him since the end of November. Manager Arsene Wenger is keen to retain the services of Arteta, who is out of contract in the summer and expected to agree a 12-month extension. Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta is confident it will take just 'five minutes' to finish a contract extension off . Arteta will miss Saturday's FA Cup semi-final against Reading as he recovers from a minor ankle problem . In Arteta's absence, the Gunners have moved up into the top two of the Barclays Premier League with a run of eight successive victories. The former Rangers and Everton man is determined to first get himself fully match fit and then sort out the formalities of a new deal. 'My only aim is to get back fit and try to perform on the pitch. As long as I do that I am sure that I will continue with this club, with the relationship I have with the club and the respect I have from everybody here,' said Arteta, who signed on transfer deadline day in August 2011. 'If I don't do that then I am not going to be here because I don't want to be somewhere where I cannot perform at my best and give what I think I can give. 'In May, when everything is fine, we will sit down and talk and it will take five minutes.' Arteta is set to step up his rehabilitation next week, and could be back in contention for the showdown against Chelsea on April 26. 'I am not far. I have done five or six sessions with the first team and I am feeling good,' he said. Arteta has missed much of the season but his team-mates have racked up a run of eight successive victories . A calf injury which sidelined him since the end of November has been followed up with a minor ankle issue . 'I don't feel I am ready to start, but I'm almost there. It has been a long process, I don't want to rush it. 'I made a mistake at the end of the rehab (from my groin problem), but I think I will be back soon.' Arteta admits it has been tough watching from the sidelines. 'It is obviously very frustrating when you cannot perform, when you cannot be out there, training or any of the basics to contribute to the team on the pitch - it makes it really hard,' he said. Manager Arsene Wenger has helped pull Arsenal up into second place without the services of his captain . 'It is part of the job and we have all been there. 'This season we have probably had more injuries than ever, so sometimes you learn other things when you are out. 'It has been frustrating and I am trying my best to get back to the level I want to be at. 'Whenever it comes, I will take it.' Arteta believes Arsenal can sustain their challenge for the title as Wenger looks win win the Premier League . Arteta believes Arsenal can sustain their challenge. 'We have got the best squad since I have been here, for sure the best squad in numbers and quality,' he said. 'We are in a really strong position now compared to where we were in November. 'Three months ago, to be in the top four was an achievement and now it is not good enough. 'In the next two weeks we can determine where we are and what we can do from then on.'

"Joan Ostojic's daughters Katherine, 21, and Alice, 19, were on a boat carrying 25 people that went down between Lombok and the Komodo Islands on Saturday.
They sat on the semi-submerged vessel's roof for 10 hours before embarking on their swim, their mother said.
Mrs Ostojic, from Stevenage, said: ""It's a relief that they are safe.""
She added: ""They are fine, carrying on with their travels, and will be home shortly.""
Travellers from New Zealand, Spain, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands were among those rescued after the boat hit a reef near Sangeang Api, a volcanic island off Sumbawa, in bad weather during the three-day journey.
Mrs Ostojic said the girls sent an email to her and her husband Peter saying they had heard everyone had been found.
They also revealed that after the boat sank in the middle of the night, they swam for eight hours to the shore before seeing the lights of some fishermen and being rescued, their mother said.
The Foreign Office said Alice Ostojic had been been travelling through Australia and south-east Asia as part of her gap year.
Katherine, who is at Bristol University studying aerospace engineering, had joined her for a month in Indonesia.
After being rescued, the girls spent the night on the nearby uninhabited volcanic island, where they were given food and water by fishermen, before they were taken to Bima in Sumbawa.
The girls lost everything in the accident apart from their passports, debit cards and cash."
"The draft Investigatory Powers Bill would place a legal duty on internet providers to assist in hacking devices.
But it would not be restricted to phones and PCs, a tech industry chief told the Commons science and technology committee.
Antony Walker, of techUK, said anything that connected to the internet could ""in theory"" be hacked into.
In the future, this could include driverless cars or household appliances connected to the internet - the so-called Internet of Things - said Mr Walker.
He said the Home Office needed to spell out more clearly where it draws the line over what it calls ""equipment interference"", highlighting recent concerns about ""smart toys"" that connect to the internet and have microphones and cameras built-in.
""A range of devices that have been in the news recently, in relation to a hack, are children's toys, that children can interact with,"" he told the committee.
""These are devices that may sit in a child's bedroom but are accessible.
""In theory, the manufacturer of those products could be the subject of a warrant to enable equipment interference with those devices.
""So the potential extent, I think, is something that needs to be carefully considered.""
In November, electronic toy company Vtech had its app store database hacked, allegedly resulting in the appearance online of personal data including children's names, dates of birth and gender.
Talking dolls, such as Hello Barbie and My Friend Cayla, have also been put under scrutiny by security experts in recent months.
Barbie manufacturer Mattel reportedly made modifications to Hello Barbie, which allows children to talk to the doll over a cloud server connection, after concerns were raised about cyber attackers potentially stealing data through it.
The police, security services, HM Revenue and Customs and other law enforcement agencies can already hack into devices provided they get a warrant.
This allows them to download the contents of computers or smartphones, track locations, listen to calls, or even switch on microphones and cameras, allowing officers to listen in to conversations or take pictures of those standing nearby.
The Home Office says these powers, the existence of which were revealed earlier this year following a court case, have ""made a vital contribution to counter the increased threat to the UK from Islamist terrorism and have also enabled the disruption of paedophile-related crime"", according to a Home Office fact sheet.
The draft Investigatory Powers Bill would put ""equipment interference"" warrants on a firmer legal footing and make sure they are ""only used when necessary and proportionate for a legitimate purpose"".
A revised bill will be introduced to Parliament in the New Year, following consultation and scrutiny by the industry and other interested parties.
Mr Walker, whose organisation represents 850 UK technology firms, told MPs it needed to be more forward-looking and less vague about the limits of surveillance.
""When we start to think, not just about the world today, but the world in five, 10 years' time as the Internet of Things becomes more real, and more pervasive.
""I think it requires careful thought in terms of where the limits should be."""
"Republicans ambushed a mini-bus carrying the men at Kingsmill in County Armagh in 1976 and murdered them after checking what religion they were.
Senior coroner John Leckey is retiring this year and told a preliminary hearing of the inquest in Belfast that no replacement has been appointed.
His retirement could leave only one coroner in Northern Ireland.
Kingsmill is among dozens of inquests dating from the early days of the Troubles that face delay because not enough money is available to investigate or there is nobody to oversee fresh hearings.
Mr Leckey said: ""I feel for the bereaved families, not exclusively Kingsmill but for other inquests I am involved in.
""It is a disappointment that is widespread.""
A lawyer for some of the Kingsmill victims' families said they would be pressing Stormont's justice department for more resources to allow an inquest to go ahead.
Karen Armstrong, a sister of one of the murdered men, said the lack of resources was ""a political problem"".
""We are not going to lie down and accept it,"" she said.
""We will fight until we get another date and they have to make sure there are enough coroners in Northern Ireland to deal with our and many other cases.""
Ulster Unionist MLA Danny Kennedy said he would be asking Justice Minister David Ford to ensure the matter was referred to the relevant authorities so that ""action can be taken as soon as possible"".
""Justice has been denied for almost 40 years and it is totally unacceptable that this inquest should be delayed further due to the unavailability of a coroner,"" he said.
""This was one of the most shocking and cruel events of the Troubles and the inquest must be treated with the seriousness this crime merits.""
A Department of Justice spokesman said: ""Officials are actively working to ensure that all necessary resources are provided for the conduct of inquests in Northern Ireland.
""There are currently three full-time coroners in Northern Ireland. In addition, one High Court judge and one County Court judge have also been appointed as coroners."""
"The £200 ""monocular"", which has a built-in laser illuminator to improve viewing in the dark, will be used by Stafford Borough Council inspectors.
During winter months it is more difficult to catch irresponsible dog owners, the council said.

Updates on this story and more from Staffordshire
""The only people who should be worried (about this) are the inconsiderate dog owners who are not clearing up after their dogs,"" a spokesman said.
Previous council schemes have involved people ringing a phone line to highlight the worst-hit areas.
Staff are already targeting these ""hotspots"", the council said, but have found it difficult since the clocks went back.
Councillor Frank Finlay, cabinet member for environment and health, said the council had tremendous support from the community to get rid of this ""disgusting crime"".
""These night-vision goggles will help us overcome this problem and let people know that, even under the cover of darkness, they cannot get away with showing blatant disregard to their fellow citizens,"" he said."
"A British solicitor and former Mayor of Glastonbury has been revealed as a key prosecutor of the evil camp guards of Bergen-Belsen after its liberation in 1945 . Cecil Hamilton-Miller, from Kensington, London, was responsible for the convictions of 31 concentration camp guards in 1945, including several key Belsen figures, such as camp commander Josef Kramer and Dr Fritz Klein. Mr Hamilton-Miller, who died in 2001, aged 91, struggled to talk to about the horrors he witnessed during the holocaust or the role he played after the liberation of Belsen, his family has said today. Hero: Cecil Hamilton-Miller, pictured as Mayor of Glastonbury, was part of the team that prosecuted dozens of the men and women responsible for running the notorious Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp . Cecil Hamilton-Miller can be seen on the right, watching on as Bergen-Belsen camp commander Josef Kramer, known as The Beast of Belsen, is marched to his death at gunpoint following his trial in 1945 . Despite his honourable actions in the wake of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp, which took place 70 years ago this month, many family and friends had no idea of his involvement. A historic photograph found by Mr Hamilton-Miller's family shows him watching on as camp commander Josef Kramer, known as The Beast of Belsen, is marched to his death at gunpoint following his trial. His cousin William Miller, 63, who has written a biography about the late solicitor, said: 'Cecil couldn't talk about his Belsen experience in later life without tears streaming down his face because of the traumatic memories. 'He never publicised his extraordinary war record but I am very proud of it - it must rate as the most important legal work of his career.' Prosecutor: Mr Hamilton-Miller served in India for much of World War II and arrived in Bergen-Belsen shortly after its liberation in May 1945 . Bergen-Belsen was a Nazi concentration camp in Lower Saxony, Germany. It was initially intended to hold prisoners of war, but in 1943, parts of the camp became a 'transit camp' for, mainly Jewish, civilian prisoners, . The camp became the final resting place of some 20,000 prisoners of war and 50,000 Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Nazi opponents and disabled, and was is burned to the ground after its liberation by British and Canadian troops in April 1945. After qualifying as a solicitor in 1935, Cambridge educated Mr Hamilton-Miller was enlisted into the Territorial Army in 1936 and then, in 1939, was granted an emergency commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the Border Regiment. For much of the war he served in India, until in 1944 he returned to Britain on leave and was posted to Carlisle. This ended abruptly on April 15, 1945 when the 11th Armoured Division of the British Army liberated Bergen-Belsen. Recognising that the liberated camps on the continent would require military lawyers, Mr Hamilton-Miller was among those immediately posted immediately to the British Liberation Army, 49 Reinforcement Holding Unit, where he was appointed Staff Captain to 21 Army Group HQ, War Crimes Investigation Team, arriving at Belsen sometime after May 5 to a horrific, challenging and distressing scene. Mr Hamilton-Miller's role appears to have been to assist Major Savile Geoffrey Champion, head of No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Unit, Belsen, to prepare the legal cases against the SS camp personnel. Mr Miller added: 'Cecil's team opened a war crimes investigation office inside the camp and files were opened on each guard. 'Gradually written witness statements and other evidence built up in each file enabling decisions to be made as to whether and when the case against each guard was sufficiently clear and strong to progress to trial.' The first Belsen trial began on September 17, 1945, at Luneburg Town Hall and took the form of a Military Tribunal. Up in smoke: Bergen-Belsen, which became the final resting place of 20,000 POWs and 50,000 Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Nazi opponents and people with disabilities is burned to the ground after liberation in 1945 . The trial of the prison guard, called Rothe, who killed a young girl by beating her was sentenced to ten years in prison. Mr Hamilton-Miller was also responsible for the camp commandant Kramer, the doctor, Dr Klein, and nine guards, being sentenced to death by hanging. Nineteen guards were sentenced to prison terms of between life and one year, with most of them having to serve between ten and 15 years. Mr Miller added: 'Many inmates at Belsen had been moved hurriedly from Auschwitz, and Cecil's unit took evidence from witnesses against Nazi criminals such as Dr Mengele, guards responsible for selecting people to go to the gas chambers, as well as conducting horrific medical experiments on them. 'Cecil appears to have remained in the Belsen posting until December 1945 after which he was sent home and demobbed.' Upon his return to the UK, Mr Hamilton-Miller re-qualified as a solicitor and married Sylvia Hurle. The pair lived in Glastonbury, Somerset, where Cecil lived for the majority of his life, becoming Mayor of the city in 1969. After his wife's death Cecil moved to family in Norwich before his death in 2001 aged 91."
"Sir Martin Moore-Bick sent the letter late on Thursday following weeks of discussion with survivors.
There has been controversy over Sir Martin's suitability for the role and the areas the inquiry will cover.
The prime minister will set out the terms of reference for the process in the coming weeks.
Downing Street said: ""The prime minister has received the letter and will consider it and respond shortly.""
How far the inquiry can go has been a source of controversy since the Sir Martin's appointment was announced.
He angered survivors on his first day in the job by indicating the investigation would be ""pretty well limited"" to examining the cause of the fire, how it spread and how to prevent future incidents.
But he later vowed to consider a ""broad range of evidence"" which could include why residents' warnings about fire safety were allegedly ignored by authorities.
Survivors, bereaved families and other involved parties spent weeks making their case about what questions the inquiry should answer.
More than 400 submissions were received during the consultation period.
The ""Justice 4 Grenfell"" campaign said earlier this month it wanted an examination of local and national social housing policy and whether it ""increased risks to residents"".
Questions were raised in the aftermath of the disaster about the cladding used on Grenfell and other buildings. More than 100 buildings have failed the latest fire safety tests set in the wake of the fire.
Sir Martin has previously faced calls to resign from residents, while Labour MP David Lammy said he was a ""white, upper-middle class man"" who had ""never"" visited a tower block housing estate and should not have been appointed.
The inquiry is due to start in September. Sir Martin has previously said an interim report could be produced within a year.
The prime minister will set out the terms of reference for the process in the coming weeks."
"The hosts were on course for the second highest chase in women's Twenty20 internationals before rain intervened.
Sarah Taylor (66) top-scored in England's 156-6 but Dane van Niekerk hit 63 as South Africa reached 145-3 when the match was called off.
England, who had never lost a T20 to South Africa before this match, dropped Van Nierkerk on 6 and 22.
Van Nierkerk's 63 came off 43 balls, hitting seven fours and two sixes, as she put on 68 with captain Mignon du Preez.
That partnership took South Africa to 98-1, but Du Preez scored 47 not out and Marizanne Kapp 21 to take South Africa home.
England will rue their missed chances in the South Africa innings when a sloppy fielding performance saw them drop a number of catches, leak runs and miss run-out chances.
Taylor scored 66 from 52 balls for England, with eight fours, her second half-century of the series after her unbeaten 74 in England's win in Paarl.
Taylor had partnerships of 63 with Heather Knight (29) and 61 with captain Charlotte Edwards (34) but England struggled to kick on in the latter overs.
Despite late hitting from Danielle Wyatt, who scored 17 not out, England lost two wickets to run-outs in the final over in which they scored just four runs.
England captain Charlotte Edwards: ""I thought we batted well and that should have been enough. We were undone by a brilliant innings by Van Niekerk and dropped catches cost us.
""We let ourselves down a little bit, but Dane really took the attack to us. We must take our chances.""
South Africa captain Mignon Du Preez: ""We knew that we had the firepower in the line-up, even though we had to go at eight an over. The momentum is with us so we're looking forward to a very competitive game at the Wanderers.""
Dane van Niekerk: ""I enjoyed myself at the top of the order. I did things differently than yesterday and it came up. I'm hitting the ball well.""
Former England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent:
""England bowled poorly and dropped catches and weren't up to standard. If they play at their best they will be fine because they have talented players such as Sarah Taylor, but they need to work on their game for the World Twenty20.""
Both sides travel to the Wanderers for Sunday's series decider which gets underway at 8:00 GMT.
Sunday's match is both teams' last before the World Twenty20 in India which starts on 15 March, with England beginning their campaign against Bangladesh in Bangalore on 17 March."
"A 'perfectionist' straight A student who was stressed about her studies was killed by a speeding train, a coroner heard today. Chandni Nigam, 19, spent six years battling demons which spawned from an obsession to do well at school, an inquest into her death was told. Miss Nigam would stay up late studying, resulting in sleep deprivation and a negative impact on her performance at school - which caused further depression and anxiety. Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford heard the teenager, who had been a volunteer at the London Olympics in 2012, was also worried about her appearance. An inquest heard Chandni Nigam, 19, spent six years battling demons which spawned from an obsession to do well at school. Stock photo . Tragically, she had first told her parents she was feeling suicidal in 2013 and had even said she would stand in front of a fast train on a Tuesday to take her life - which is how she ultimately died. Miss Nigam had seen a number of doctors over several years, but her father Ankush Nigam told the inquest that she had often refused treatment. He explained that he felt he was 'torturing' his daughter by making her attend appointments - and eventually accepted that she would one day take her life. On February last year, the teenager was struck by a train travelling from London Paddington to Hereford at Twyford railway station in Berkshire. In a statement to the court, train driver Stephen Wood said he saw a pair of legs running into his view from the right as he approached the station. Mr Wood said: 'I saw a person turn towards me and spread their arms wide apart. The train struck this person.' The driver had applied the emergency brake and paramedics were called to the scene, but Miss Nigam, from Lower Earley, Berkshire, died instantly from multiple injuries. Mr Nigam said: 'I'm glad she's in a peaceful place.' He said his daughter first started showing signs of depression and sleep deprivation at 13 and had been on various medication since. The teenager was struck by a train in February last year at Twyford railway station (pictured) in Berkshire . Her doctors had believed she showed improvement when on medication, but she was often reluctant to take it. And Mr Nigam criticised doctors for not believing him and his wife when she said their daughter's condition was worse than she presented to medics. She told doctors she did not want medication for her condition and was not judged to be a suicide risk. But Mr Nigam said his concerns were not taken seriously, even when he explained she had told her parents how she would kill herself in October 2013. He said his daughter had said she knew the times of fast trains and that it would be on a Tuesday. 'That was the first time she made a comment in respect of the train,' he said. 'She clicked her fingers and said it would be instantaneous, so don't worry.' The inquest heard she told doctors she did not want medication for her condition and was not judged to be a suicide risk. Mr Nigam said he began to accept there was nothing that could be done to help his daughter. He said: 'Nobody was willing to accept our version of events. What she said was given so much significance while what we said was ignored. 'I thought I might as well just let her go. I was waiting for something like this to happen. I literally felt like a passenger. 'I wish I had not subjected her to any of those doctors or anybody now. All I have done is added to her misery.' He added that every time he dropped his daughter off at a train station, he feared it would be the last time he saw her. He believes his daughter eventually took her life because she feared she would be put back on medication. The inquest heard Miss Nigam had suffered from a number of conditions in addition to depression, including acne, malnutrition, hair loss and itchy skin. She had achieved all A and A* grades at GCSE level, but was in and out of school and college as she battled her illness. The inquest continues.

"The time of their lives has turned into the holiday from hell for up to 2500 passengers stranded on a cruise ship, the Carnival Spirit, outside Sydney Harbour and riding a constant flow of smashing waves of more than nine metres. They have been at the mercy of the wild seas since last night, as storms batter the east coast. The massive swell, seen from video images taken from on-board by stranded travellers, revealing just how treacherous and stomach churning the conditions are, out there. One has told the Daily Telegraph that 'there was a large wave that hit at 7.30 last night that tore one of the doors off causing a whole lot of water to come flooding through the deck'. 'Even as we speak the ship is creaking and moaning,' passenger Kurt Foster said. 'Last night was absolutely horrendous. In the room all the cupboard doors were flying open and everything on the bench tops was flying off. 'One crew member has been working here for 10 years and he reckons it’s the roughest he’s seen.' Scroll down for videos . 2500 passengers on board the Carnival Spirit are at the mercy of the wild seas as storms batter the east coast - with the massive swell, seen from video images shot from on-board, showing just how treacherous and stomach churning the conditions are . The cruise ship Carnival Spirit has been damaged outside Sydney Harbour this morning. Due to dock at 7:15 the ship is currently sitting off Sydney Heads. The ship has suffered damage in wild weather conditions off the NSW coast. The hand railing and pedestal lighting has been damaged while a cover over the satellite system (above) has also been damaged and removed for safety reasons . The cyclonic winds battering Sydney have also caused drama for passengers on board cruise liner the Carnival Spirit which is heading south after being prevented from docking because of the heavy seas . Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves . The Carnival Spirit has 2500 passengers on board, stranded outside of Sydney Harbour because of the city's wild weather . Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves, which began crashing into the ship late on Monday and have continued unabated, amid reports that there has been some damage. 'High winds have caused minor damage to some external features such as an equipment cover and some partitioning, while heavy rains have dampened some doorway carpets,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'This damage is superficial and has not affected the ship’s operation in any way. Guests and crew are safe and the Captain is ensuring guests are as comfortable as possible.' Eleven metre waves have been recorded off-shore and more passengers have been recounting their wild ride. 'It’s not pleasant, it’s been like this all night,' one woman told ABC radio. 'I don’t think many people got much sleep.' Carnival Cruise Lines officials confirmed with Daily Mail Australia that Carnival Spirit was scheduled to arrive 'early this morning' but was unable to do so because of the rough seas. 'The scheduled Sydney arrival of Carnival Cruise Lines’ Carnival Spirit has been delayed due to severe weather which has led to the closure of Sydney port and prevented the Harbour Pilot from boarding the ship,' the statement said. 'The ship is now waiting off the Sydney coast line until the port is re-opened.' And nothing can be done until conditions ease to allow the regulatory process to take place. 'It is mandatory maritime requirement for a Harbour Pilot to board any ship before it enters Sydney port,' Carnival Cruise Lines stated further. 'Guests and crew are safe and comfortable and the ship is continuing to offer a full program of on-board activities and entertainment while it waits for the harbour to re-open.' Eleven metre waves have been recorded off-shore as the cruise ship Carnival Spirit remains stranded outside Sydney Harbour . Waves of nine metres have been battering the ship for the past 24 hours. The Carnival Spirit remains stuck outside Sydney Heads due to the swell and may not be able to enter the harbour for 48 hours . Carnival Cruise Liners in statement said: 'Guests and crew are safe and comfortable and the ship is continuing to offer a full program of on-board activities and entertainment while it waits for the harbour to re-open' In a further statement placed on social media, to those travellers caught out by the drama, they said: 'We are sorry to announce that Carnival Spirit will be unable to sail from Sydney today as the port of Sydney has been closed due to extreme weather and ships are not permitted to enter Sydney Harbour.' 'For guests scheduled to depart for the South Pacific on S512, the Captain is working on a revised 7-day itinerary departing tomorrow, weather permitting. The revised itinerary will visit Isle of Pines and Noumea, but not the originally scheduled port of Mare.' The Ports Authority warned that passengers were in for some more discomfort, with little chance of the ship being able to dock on Tuesday, with the adverse weather conditions expected to worsen as another storm cell pushes into Sydney."
"The bodies of four people, including two young boys under the age of ten, were discovered in a Oklahoma home on Wednesday afternoon in what police suspect was a murder-suicide. The unidentified family - a 38-year-old mother, 42-year-old father and their two sons - apparently died from gunshot wounds. Tulsa police said 'based on the physical evidence inside the house', they believe the father killed his wife and children before using the gun on himself and are not seeking a suspect.

'This place should be a place surrounded by security.' Perez's wife, Mercedes, said: 'I love this neighborhood. It's very quiet here.' Most every property in the neighborhood has a large fence, so kids can play or swim in privacy. Stephen Wiseman lived next door to the family for almost ten years. He said: They were wonderful, the most kind [and] gentle people you’d ever meet. 'Our kids played with them all day on Saturday, and … we saw the kids on Sunday.' Another neighbor reported hearing noises at the house late on Monday."

"Scotland Office minister Lord Dunlop was speaking as the House of Lords debated the Scotland Bill.
Talks between the UK and Scottish governments on the fiscal framework continued over the weekend, although no agreement has yet been announced.
Lord Dunlop said the talks were at a ""sensitive and critical point"".
But he told peers that ""significant progress"" had been made.
Peers agreed to go ahead with detailed scrutiny of the new powers contained in the Scotland Bill despite the lack of agreement on the fiscal framework.
Tory former Scottish secretary Lord Forsyth had called for the final day's committee stage debate to be delayed until the fiscal framework was published.
But he withdrew his demand after opposition from both the government and Labour.
Labour's former chancellor, Lord Darling, said it was ""deeply regrettable"" that parliament still did not know what the fiscal framework was going to look like.
Lord Darling said there were ""massive considerations"" to take into account in determining tax and welfare.
He added: ""I struggle to see how it's going to work. If we don't get it right, we could be simply storing up problems for the future, providing rich and fertile grounds for those who seek out grudge and grievance as a way of life.""
Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney held talks with his UK government counterparts in London on Friday.
Mr Swinney said afterwards that progress had been made, but some ""significant issues"" still remained before a final deal could be agreed.
The two government have been locked in protracted discussions about how the block grant that Holyrood receives should be adjusted when new tax powers are devolved to Scotland.
Any deal must meet the principle of ""no detriment"" - the idea that neither the UK or Scottish governments should lose out financially simply as a result of the decision to devolve.
Mr Swinney and Scottish Secretary David Mundell are both due to appear before the Scottish Parliament's Devolution Committee on Tuesday, where they will be asked to lay out their positions.
With the Scottish Parliament being dissolved next month ahead of May's elections, MSPs on the committee had warned of ""very substantial impacts"" on their ability to scrutinise any proposals if talks were not concluded by 19 February.
But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Greg Hands has said he will not be able to appear before Holyrood's Finance Committee on Wednesday to give evidence to MSPs about the talks.
Mr Hands, who has been negotiating on behalf of the UK government during the talks, had previously said he would be ""very happy"" to appear before MSPs once a deal had been reached.
In a letter to the committee, he said: ""I fully intend to honour that commitment. Unfortunately, due to parliamentary business I can not attend your committee on 24 February.
""I look forward to appearing before your committee once the framework is agreed.""
In response, committee convenor Kenneth Gibson told Mr Hands: ""This would appear to suggest that you do not think an agreement will be reached on the fiscal framework before then.""
He urged Mr Hands to reconsider, stating: ""If this is indeed the case, then it is essential that the Finance Committee has the opportunity to hear from both governments as to why it has not been possible to reach an agreement.""
The Scottish government has already warned it will pull the plug on the Scotland Bill by recommending MSPs veto the legislation if an agreement over the fiscal framework cannot be found."
"There was a larger message in the article about a purported gang rape that Rolling Stone retracted on Sunday night -- a part of the story that was never disputed: The University of Virginia is under continuing investigation over how it handles sexual assault on campus. The school has never expelled a single student for sexual assault -- even when the student admitted to it. The Virginia attorney general asked the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers to take a look at how the university historically handled allegations of sexual assault by its students. That includes how UVA officials handled the allegations in the discredited Rolling Stone article by a student the magazine called ""Jackie,"" especially since the school knew about the allegations for more than a year before the article came out. The alleged gang rape at a fraternity house was in 2012, and Jackie told the university about it the next spring. She started telling her story very publicly, including at a ""take back the night"" rally. But Charlottesville police didn't hear about it until after a separate incident in the spring of 2014, in which Jackie claimed someone threw a bottle that hit her in the face. When a university dean arranged for her to talk to police about that alleged assault, she also told the story of the alleged 2012 incident. In both cases, police said Jackie refused to cooperate and so they could not pursue the case. But more women came forward to talk about their experiences -- women whose stories were not as dramatic or horrific as Jackie's. Rolling Stone's story opened up a conversation about the topic, and then women began coming forward to talk about a culture on campus that was not sensitive to victims. Many women told CNN about a euphemism for the word rape used by other students on campus. They'd call it a ""bad experience."" Others told CNN that there were fraternities with reputations for being ""rapey"" and for using date-rape drugs. That some judged who could come in based on the sluttiness of a woman's outfit. And if a woman did report her rape, some women complained that the internal process didn't seem worth it if their abuser wouldn't be kicked out of school. Rolling Stone had a line in its original story: ""UVA's emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since 1998, 183 people have been expelled for honor-code violations such as cheating on exams. And yet paradoxically, not a single student at UVA has ever been expelled for sexual assault."" After the article published, UVA admitted this and instituted a zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault going forward -- although that policy was never defined, so it's unclear what it means. When the story was deleted from Rolling Stone's website, that was lost. ""You lose a lot of other people's voices who were in that article,"" said Sarah Roderick, a survivor and UVA student, ""and a lot of good things that could have come about. Fixing problems with administration here and on our campus"" -- and, she added, across the nationo. Along with the O'Melveny & Myers investigation, there's also an open Title IX investigation into UVA by the U.S. Department of Education as a result of a civil suit. The attorney who filed the suit, James Marsh, told CNN that UVA medical staff lost or destroyed evidence from the alleged sexual assault victim he's representing, making it impossible for her to move forward and get justice. When the Columbia Journalism School's 12,000-plus-word critique is summed up, it really boils down to this: The mistake could have been avoided if the writer, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, had picked up the phone and made just a few more phone calls to the friends of Jackie who she claimed were with her that night. They'd later tell other media outlets, including CNN, that they remembered a very different story. Rolling Stone says their account would have been a red flag. And all three say they would have talked if they'd been called. Ryan Duffin, one of the trio, said he felt deceived by Jackie, but he also pointed out that Erdely's mistake in fact-checking was about one single incident, and the fallout has caused a much bigger issue to be lost. ""Had she gotten in direct contact with us, it probably wouldn't have been printed, at least in that way,"" he said. ""A lot of the article was still based in truth, but the focal point would have been different."" It might have been less dramatic, but it would have probably focused on some of the other UVA students who shared much more common stories of acquaintance rape on campus. ""I think my problem with it was that this reporter wanted to sensationalize an experience that's not very common,"" Roderick said. ""... And I wonder if it would have been different if (it dealt) with someone with a less horrific story -- something that happens to more people. I think this discredits what a lot of survivors go through. Something this physically horrific is not what everyone goes through. Now it's like, 'If I wasn't assaulted by more than one man then my story is not as worthy of attention.' It's frustrating that this is how rape is portrayed on college campuses because this is not the norm."" Before the report came out, Abraham Axler, the student body president, said that some good had come from the article because it forced UVA to institute new policies and to open up a conversation on a topic that needed to be discussed nationwide. But some survivors and advocates are afraid the retraction set back their progress. ""I do feel like there's a possibility people will be afraid to come forward. If you come forward and share your story, if you don't have the date right, every detail down, you'll think, 'I'm going to be accused of being a liar. It's easier for me to keep it to myself,'"" Roderick said. ""There are very serious and unresolved questions about the university's performance,"" said Steve Coll, dean of the Columbia School of Journalism. ""Rolling Stone teed that subject up. I wouldn't say that everything about Rolling Stone's treatment of that subject was perfect, but it certainly doesn't fall under the same category as their reporting about Jackie's narrative."""
"When the first pictures of Kim Sears in her wedding dress surfaced yesterday, they got a mixed reaction. The Jenny Packham chiffon gown with jewelled-detailing on the arms has split opinion, with some on Twitter raving about the garment and others claiming it swamped her. Over the last few years, wedding dress choices have become so varied that they fall into very distinct camps - short, boho, quirky traditional and more. Scroll down for video . Andy Murray and Kim Sears leave Dunblane cathedral after getting married this weekend . Zeenat Sabvur from the wedding planning website Ready or Knot believes brides are thinking outside the box a lot more when it comes to their wedding dresses nowadays, instead of having their choices dictated by tradition. She said: 'Brides don't go for what they think they should go for anymore,they choose their dress more on what their personalities are like. 'Angelina always said that her children were the reason for her getting married, so she made the day very much based around them and that included the dress. 'Keira Knightley's was quirkier - she wore a dress that had worn before and that had a lot of stories to it. 'The change of attitude towards dresses is the same as with the wedding cake, brides don't necessarily get cake anymore, they might get cheese, profiteroles or cupcake. 'Weddings are now about personalities and celebrating  their relationships, which makes it more fun.' Read on to discover the different types of wedding dresses that brides are opting for nowadays... The Traditional Dress . Prince William and Kate Middleton get married in 2011 at Westminster Abbey . Many brides still opt for the traditional white gown when it comes to their wedding outfit. When Kate Middleton married Prince William in 2011, she opted for an elegant lace gown by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen. The intricate lace appliqué bodice and sleeves of Catherine's dress mirrored those on the wedding gown of Grace Kelly, who became Princess Grace of Monaco when she married Ranier III, Prince of Monaco, in 1956. Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeldsaid of the dress:' Alexander McQueen's dresses are always very elegant. 'It's very pretty, and relatively classic, but that goes with the decor, with a little touch of the 1950s that recalls Marilyn Monroe or Queen Elizabeth's dress.' The non-dress wedding dress . Solange Knowles and Alan Ferguson on their wedding day . When Solange Knowles arrived at her wedding to her video director boyfriend Alan Ferguson last November, she looked stunning in a cream jumpsuit, complete with a matching cape. Solange is known for her bold style, so she was unlikely to have opted for a traditional gown. She wore a long caped gown by Humberto Leon for Kenzo for the nuptials but arrived at the ceremony in a Stephane Rolland cream jump suit, having travelled there on a white-painted bicycle decorated with cream roses. The theme of the bash was a stylish, if unconventional affair, with all guests encouraged to wear white, including her sister Beyoncé and mother Tina. More and more women are opting for trouser suits or jumpsuits at weddings now, to give them freedom of movement. The boho dress . Kate Moss married Jamie Hince in 2011 . When Kate Moss married Jamie Hince in a village church in the Cotswolds, she looked stunning in a vintage-style cream dress and matching floor-length veil, designed by close friend John Galliano. The model showed off her slim figure in a cream bias-cut dress with sheer skirt with gold leaf embroidery and rhinestones. Her head piece featured floral detailing on either side of an off-white headband and Manolo Blahnik designed a special pair of wedding shoes that include a blue insole as Kate's 'something blue'. Zeenat said: 'Kate Moss's wedding dress was beautiful , everything from the dress to the veil and the flower girls were very boho and very unique.' The short dress . Keira Knightley marries Jamie Righton in 2013 . Keira Knightley was the epitome of laid-back cool when she got married to Jamie Righton at the town hall in Mazan, a small town around 12 miles from Marseilles in 2013. She wore a pale pink tulle Chanel dress with a pink jacket and a pair of sunglasses. The dress had actually been worn by Keira several times before - most memorably to the BAFTAs in 2008. The actress has confessed that in addition to the Chanel dress, pictured, that she wore for her civil wedding in the South of France last year, she also had a custom-made £50,000 Valentino dress for a secret second ceremony. She told Elle magazine she decided to wear the simple Chanel dress for the first ceremony because ‘every time I’ve worn that dress, I’ve had a fantastic night and if you’ve got a dress where you’ve always had a fantastic night, it’s worth having another fantastic night in it’. The DIY dress . Angelina Jolie married Brad Pitt last August . Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt always said that they would get married when their children asked them to. So it comes as no surprise that their six-strong brood played an integral part of their wedding day on August 23 last year at their French estate Chateau Miraval. Indeed, the blushing bride took the unusual measure of letting her kids decorate her wedding dress, walking down the aisle in a gorgeous yet simple white satin gown and long veil that featured colourful drawings all over, . Created by Atelier Versace master tailor Luigi Massi, the gown featured a fitted bodice with simple thin straps, the bust complete with ruching, with a plain waist, kicking out into a flowy full skirt. Luigi then hand-sewed a number of the children's designs onto both the back of the dress and the full-length veil. 'Luigi is like family to me and I couldn't imagine anyone else making this dress,' the 39-year-old bride told People magazine. 'He knows and cares for the children and it was great fun putting it together.' The quirky wedding dress . Lady Mary Charteris married  Robbie Furze in 2012 . When It Girl Lady Mary Charteris married rock musician Robbie Furze, she opted for an eye-popping design  that made sure she stood out from the crowd. The aristocratic model chose a dress designed by Pam Hogg - who just so happens to have dressed Lady Gaga. Unsurprisingly, the odd garment was certainly something that Gaga would be proud of. Lady Mary wore the eye-catching gown, complete with tulle skirt, floral headpiece and vertiginous heels, as she tied the knot to rock musician Robbie Furze, frontman of The Big Pink. The blonde star certainly had the figure for the creation which featured cutaway detail and sheer sleeves. She wore her hair down in a loose wave and completed her look with a long veil and a chunky necklace and bridal shoes by designer Nicholas Kirkwood. The non-white dress . Jessica Biel married Justin Timberlake in 2010 . When Jessia Biel married Justin Timberlake she wore a bold pink wedding dress. Jessica, looked stunning for her happy day in a custom-made Giambattista Valli Haute Couture gown - shunning traditional white or ivory for a beautiful petal pink colour.

Jessica isn't alone in snubbing white gowns for her big day, Reece Witherspoon, Anne Hathaway and Shenae Grimes have all opted for dresses that were colourful."
"A fashion photographer suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF) is revolutionizing the way people look at the life-threatening disorder by snapping the portraits of 56 adult women living with the genetic disease to bring hope to children and teens diagnosed with the condition, which has no known cure. Ian Pettigrew, 46, from Ontario, Canada, was working on his book of portraits, Just Breathe: Adults with Cystic Fibrosis, when he realized that he had far more female subjects than male. After someone noted that the collection of photos was 'turning out to be a bunch of hot chicks with CF', he became inspired to start his second project, Salty Girls, starring women with the disorder, which damages the lungs and digestive system. 'I know what these woman go through on a daily basis; everyday it's a struggle living with CF. And, to the uninformed, it is the invisible fatal disease,' he wrote on his website of the upcoming book, which is 'dedicated to showing how beautiful those fighting CF truly are'. Scroll down for video . Beautiful fighter: Ian Pettigrew, from Ontario, Canada, photographed this woman with cystic fibrosis holding her oxygen tank as a part of his second book, Salty Girls, which aims to bring awareness to the disease . Lifelong battle: On his website, Mr Pettigrew, 46, wrote that the upcoming photography book (pictured) is 'dedicated to showing how beautiful those fighting CF truly are' For those with the inherited condition, a defective gene and its protein product cause the body to produce a thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, pancreas and other organs, with symptoms including frequent lung infections, persistent coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, poor growth and slow weight gain. Mr Pettigrew explained that at the time he had seen in the news a model with Crohn's Disease posing in a bikini with her colostomy bag, as well as Tyra Banks interviewing a model with vitiligo, a disease that causes the causes the loss of skin color. 'I just thought well, it's time for a model with CF,' he said. The project's name, Salty Girls, is derived from the fact that people with CF have more salt in their sweat compared with those who do not have the disorder. Life of the party: This model posed in her lace bra while holding a Dos Equis beer bottle for her portrait . Still smiling: Another woman with CF wore a green two-piece to show off her chest tube . 'These women are inspirational and fearless, and we want to show hope for those younger CFers,' Mr Pettigrew noted of the women, who are roughly between the ages of 20 and 40. One of the models with CF, who chose to remain anonymous, revealed on Mr Pettigrew's website that the disease has led to her having 'countless body image issues'. 'It took a huge amount of courage for me to be able to expose my body for Salty Girls,' she explained. 'When I look at my body, all I see are my scars.' She added: 'I pick out every single thing I find wrong with my body, and compare it with other women's bodies.' The woman recalled growing up and being made fun of for the scar on her stomach, which was from her first of many surgeries. After years of being insecure with her body, she has vowed to take a stance. Proud woman: This model posed topless for Mr Pettigrew while smiling at the camera . Stay strong: Another woman with CF flaunted her tattoos in a black bra top and matching underwear . Badge of honor: One of the women featured in the book (pictured) wore a colorful bikini top while exposing her scars on her stomach . 'I will learn to appreciate, love, and nurture my body the way it should be. My body may be scarred due to all of the physical trauma I have had to endure with Cystic Fibrosis, BUT, it will never define ""ME"" as a person,' she wrote. 'It will define my experiences and how it has shaped my perspective on MYSELF, and EVERYONE that is struggling [sic].' She added: 'My scars tell a story of a triumph after every obstacle. My scars tell me that no matter the BS I've had to deal with in my life - I still manage to keep the fire in my spirit BURNING. That is enough to keep me going [sic].' Mr Pettigrew, who wasn't diagnosed with CF until he was 38-years-old, is looking to bring hope to children and teens with the fatal disease. Last year, Pettigrew traveled 6,000 miles to 25 different cities to photograph 92 adults with the disorder for his book Just Breathe. No fear: Another model rolled up her muscle T-shirt to show off her scars, as well as her arm tattoos . Important message: This woman wore a tank top that reminds others that she is beautiful . Eskimo-inspired: This CF sufferer sported a furry hat and nothing else when she posed for Mr Pettigrew . 'One of the goals of this project was for younger people with CF to see the portraits and know there is future for them,' Pettigrew told The Mighty. 'Yes, there are varying degrees and not all CFers are alike. But with the advances in treatment, proper nutrition and exercise, it is a far brighter future than even just 10-15 years ago.' According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, few children who suffered from the disease in the 1950s lived to attend elementary school, but now many people diagnosed with the condition can expect to live into their 30s, 40s or longer. An estimated 30,000 people in the United States have CF, and nearly half the CF population are age 18 or older. 'People still have to realize this is a fatal, life-shortening disease,' Mr Pettigrew explained. '[CF] is brutal and heartbreaking. But there’s a sense of hope and optimism as well.'

"Taxpayers are having to find £11billion a year to top up the wages of millions of people working in supermarkets and other low paid jobs. The money, which amounts to a massive public subsidy for the companies involved, is paid to some 5.2million workers in the form of tax credits and other benefits. Campaigners say the figures shine a light on how companies making huge profits are relying on the taxpayer to ensure their staff have enough money to put food on the table. The total amount of benefits paid to staff at some companies exceeds what the firms pay in corporation tax, according to the study by Citizens UK. Critics have accused supermarkets of relying on benefits to ensure their staff earn enough to put food on the table without them having to raise wages . The charity is campaigning for the adoption of the Living Wage - £9.15 an hour in London and £7.85 for the rest of the UK - across both the public and private sector. It estimates this would reduce the need for in-work benefits by £6.7bn a year, which would make a massive dent in the £12billion reduction in welfare spending which the Conservatives say is necessary. The current minimum wage for those over 21 is £6.50 an hour and will rise to £6.70 in October, but this is well below what the Government accepts is needed by many people, particularly those with children, to make ends meet. The charity’s report complains: ‘The public subsidy enables profitable businesses to get away with paying low wages.’ Its report says Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s posted combined profits of £3.9bn last year, but between them cost the taxpayer more than £750m in benefits paid to their staff. Tesco paid £519m in tax but received £364m in public subsidy for its 209,000 low-paid workers. Asda spent £150m in tax but its 120,000 low-paid workers received £221m in benefits. Morrisons’ tax bill was £62m while its 83,000 low-paid workers received £190m in benefits and Sainsbury’s paid £180m in tax, almost exactly as much as its low-paid staff received from the public purse. Of all the profitable companies examined by the charity, Next had the highest average subsidy of £2,087 per head given its high proportion of young employees who are typically paid just above the minimum wage of £6.70 an hour. Next is run by the Conservative peer, Lord Wolfson, who came under fire last month for criticising the whole idea of a Living Wage as an ‘invention’ Next is run by the Conservative peer, Lord Wolfson, who came under fire last month for criticising the whole idea of a Living Wage as an ‘invention’. He argued that pushing up wages will block recruitment. ‘For very many people, the retail sector provides useful income and Next has 30 applications for every vacancy. Raising wages too fast will simply reduce employment opportunities,’ he said. Other firms who rely on the taxpayer to top up staff wages include Amazon, fast food outlets and local authorities, where cleaning and care workers, for example, are already paid by the taxpayer. Paul Regan, chairman of Citizens UK, said: ‘The major retailers post profits and pay tax, but the Treasury has to step in and often pays out more than it gets in to help those workers for whom work does not pay.’ He called on the next government to show leadership ‘by implementing the living wage into all public sector commissioning’. The Rev Karen Rooms, Area Dean for Nottingham South and member of the Citizens UK Council, said: ‘The figures revealed by this research are shocking, as the true scale of the subsidy of big business becomes clear. ‘The huge profits made by some of these high street names are made off the back of poverty-wages. In some instances the amount of tax they pay doesn’t even cover the wage top-ups we all have to chip-in and help with through the Treasury. ‘At a time of austerity when all sectors of society have to make savings it seems obscene that big business isn’t playing its part to help the country recover.’ All of the main political parties support the living wage. Last week, David Cameron said businesses that can afford to pay it ‘should consider doing so’. Boris Johnson, the London mayor, said it was ‘madness’ that large employers paid chief executives huge salaries while their lowest-paid workers were subsidised by the taxpayer. Labour has made demands for employers to pay the Living Wage a major plank of its election strategy. However, the former Labour Cabinet minister Alan Milburn, chairman of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, said it could take 10 years to make the living wage a reality. He said: ‘Employers will have to pay more but wages cannot rise without improved productivity and more skills training. We will need a 10-year transition period to become a living wage country.’ Charles Cotton, of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, warned wage rises will hit employment, saying: ‘If employees weren’t getting subsidies, would firms employ as many people or would they cut back?’ Supermarkets said they paid above the minimum wage of £6.50 an hour for those aged over 21, regularly reviewed pay and gave employees benefits such as staff discounts. Asda, which is part of the US retail goliath Walmart, said pay and benefits ‘should be considered in the round’. In the USA, it is estimated that Walmart’s low-wage workers cost U.S. taxpayers an estimated $6.2 billion (£4.2bn) in public assistance including food stamps, Medicaid and subsidised housing. Morrisons said discounts and profit-sharing took the pay of many over the living wage. Sainsbury’s said it offered employees a discount card, annual bonus and paid breaks. Tesco said it paid, on average, 4-7per cent more than major competitors and had contributed £1.5bn in tax through business rates, employer national insurance and corporation tax in 2014. The British Retail Consortium said pay and benefits packages equated to an average of about £8.40 an hour and the industry had paid £19.5bn in ‘core business taxes’ last year. Asda, which is part of the US retail goliath Walmart, said pay and benefits ‘should be considered in the round’"
"Documents filed with US regulator said French authorities recently completed an audit of Booking.com's accounts from 2003 to 2012.

"Lawrence Dallaglio views the poor performance of English clubs in Europe as a 'crisis' for French rugby rather than evidence of a gulf in class between the Aviva Premiership and Top 14. Saracens are the nation's solitary representative in the semi-finals after Bath, Northampton and Wasps tumbled out of the Champions Cup over the weekend, scraping through 12-11 against Racing Metro. Most alarming of the defeats was Clermont's spellbinding 37-5 rout of reigning Premiership champions and runaway leaders Saints, whose director of rugby Jim Mallinder admitted the result points to a chasm between the English and French leagues. Lawrence Dallaglio views poor performance of English clubs as a 'crisis' for French rugby . Marcelo Bosch kicks the match-winning penalty from long-range to snatch Saracen's a semi-final berth . Bosch jumps into the arms of Rhys Gills after his successful kick as Hodgson joins the celebrations . Scenes of elation as Saracens clinch victory with the last play of the match against Racing Metro 92 . The divide will only grow as more of the southern hemisphere's finest talent head for the Top 14, as typified by Will Genia's decision to snub Bath for Stade Francais and Dan Carter's vast £1.4million salary when he joins Racing Metro after the World Cup. While former England captain Dallaglio regards the influx of household names as exciting for France's club game, he believes it is a disaster for the national side who have not finished above fourth place in the RBS 6 Nations since 2011. Clermont's  Wesley Fofana runs with the ball during the European Rugby Champions Cup match . 'Last weekend's results don't mean there's a crisis in English rugby, rather that the French clubs have more strength in depth,' Dallaglio said. 'I don't think there's a huge difference in class between the English and French leagues - the Northampton result was a one off. 'In fact I'd argue that what we're seeing is a crisis in French rugby. I see players who are outstanding for their clubs - guys like Wesley Fofana and Maxime Machenaud - not playing well for France. Clermont winger Napolioni Nalaga runs with the ball during the match against Northampton . Wasps' Ashley Johnson attempts to bust through the wall-like defence of European champions Toulon . 'There is something going dramatically wrong in French rugby because while they're happy to attract the biggest and best foreign names to their club game, they're doing so at the expense of their national side. 'There's a balance to be struck and we've got it right in England, Ireland and Wales, but in France it's totally out of balance.' Fofana was mesmerising against Northampton yet he was eclipsed by former England full-back Nick Abendanon, whose debut season at Clermont has been a roaring success and prompted calls for an end to his international exile. Wasps' No 10 Alex Lozowski kicks away from Michalak during their European Champions Cup quarter-final . Clermont winger Noa Nakaitaci (right) scores his second try against Northampton . Nine months in the Top 14 has shaped Abendanon's own views on Les Bleus' shortcomings. 'A lot of the players representing France I wouldn't pick if I was their coach,' Abendanon said. 'This is only my personal opinion, but the coaching at Clermont is of a very high standard while the French team is looking a little bit lost. They need guidance and better coaching. 'France seem to kick away a lot of ball, yet they have players like have Yoann Huget and Wesley Fofana in their backline.' Ali Williams crosses for a late try for Toulon as they put victory over Wasps on Sunday beyond doubt . nICK Abendanon cast his magic over the saints defence to inspire comprehensive victory . Abendanon's Clermont will face Saracens in the first Champions Cup semi-final in Saint-Etienne on April 18, a rematch of last season's showdown at the same stage when the French club were humbled 46-6 at Twickenham. Dallaglio believes spectators at the Stade Marcel-Michelin on Saturday had been present at a special performance that left Northampton shell-shocked. 'Clermont are the best side not to have won the European cup and you get the sense from their win against Northampton that their name might be on the trophy this year,' Dallaglio said. Northampton captain Dylan Hartley leads his team off the pitch after crushing defeat . 'That was possibly the best quarter-final performance I have seen in the history of this competition. It will take a very good side to stop them. 'Northampton will be scratching their heads wondering why they lost by so many points, but they were simply blown away by a side who reached a completely different level. 'That doesn't make Northampton a bad side - we've all come back from France with our tails between our legs after being beaten by a better side and I include myself in that.'

"For its 3-2 victory over a team backed by phone-maker Samsung, SKT's five members shared a prize of $2m (Â£1.64m) between them.
The win is the third time in four years that SKT has taken the title. It also won the title in 2015.
The final ran for six hours and was held in front of almost 20,000 LoL fans at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.
SKT's Lee Sang-hyeok, aka Faker, was named as the most valuable player of the tournament.
The total prize pot for the tournament was $5m with $750,000 going to second place team Samsung. The money available to teams taking part was increased by fan contributions.
Writing on the Rock, Paper Shotgun gaming news site, Philippa Warr said the final had been ""breathtaking"", as the Samsung team had fought back from losing the first two games.
However, she said, everything had changed in the ""beautiful"" third game, which lasted 70 minutes and saw Samsung wrest a keenly contested win from SKT.
Samsung then took the fourth game more easily to set up the decider.
In the event, Warr said, SKT's ""fluidity"" and experience had won through, giving them the title, cash and Summoner's Cup trophy.

"A newly released video shows the shocking moment a Boston police officer was shot in the face just seconds after approaching a driver who was stopped during a gunfire investigation. The video shows how Angelo West, 41, immediately jumps out of the car and shoots Officer John Moynihan, 34, under the eye at close range after the policeman opens the driver-side door. West then fires at the other officers as he runs across the busy street. Boston Police Commissioner William Evans pointed out that he was firing 'under his arm' at the other cops. The video shows Boston police officer John Moynihan, circled in white, opening the driver-side door to talk to Angelo West after the car was pulled over during a gunfire investigation . West then immediately jumps out of the car and shoots Moynihan in the face at close range . Officer Moynihan , 34, was released from the hospital Friday after weeks of recovery. The Boston Police Department described his current condition as 'serious but improving' The video, captured from the surveillance camera of a nearby store, shows the beginning of the shootout that led to officers firing the fatal shots that killed West. 'This particular incident we had no other choice,' Evans said about the fatal shooting. 'He had already used deadly force, trying to kill one of my officers, and the officers did what they were trained to do.' During a press conference, Evans said the video shows that the officers did not have their weapons drawn or have their hands their hands on their weapons when they approached West's car. Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said it was important to release the video to show the community exactly what happened - and why. 'In those instances in which video evidence can inform the public... it is in everyone's best interest to share that information as soon as possible,' Conley said during the press conference. The district attorney said such transparency was necessary to 'tamp down speculation and rumors meant to inflame and not to inform'. 'Our goal going forward is to ensure that we are one people and one city,' he said. Evans said Moynihan had seen the video. Angelo West was fatally shot by Moynihan's colleagues during the shoot-out. Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said that 'during this particular incident' the officers had no other choice . The video shows how West fired at the other officers after shooting Moynihan while he ran across the street . 'He probably realizes he's really lucky to be talking at this point, to be shot so suddenly with a .357 Magnum in the face and to be around talking about it, and hopefully to make as much of a full recovery as we think he's going to,' he said during the conference, captured by WCVB. But Evans said 'there are no winners here'. 'We have an officer who was seriously injured, and we have a family who is grieving the loss of a loved one,' he said. Moynihan was released from the hospital yesterday after weeks of recovering from the gunshot wound. His condition was described as 'serious but improving' in a statement released by the Boston Police Department. The statement said Moynihan wanted to 'thank and acknowledge the officers on scene for their lightening quick reaction and response that he credits for saving his life'. Moynihan is a highly decorated military veteran awarded a medal for bravery by President Obama for his involvement in a shoot-out with the Boston Bombing suspects. After the March 28 shooting, Moynihan was placed in an induced coma as he fought for his life. He also had to undergo surgery for the removal of the bullet lodged under his right eye. Moynihan and five other officers approached West's car to speak to one of his two passengers, alleged gang member Dennis Wilson Jr. There were reports of gunfire near where Wilson lived and he was tracked down using the GPS coordinates of a bracelet he had to wear while on bail for unrelated charges, according to the Boston Globe. The officers stopped the SUV in two unmarked police vehicles and headed to the car so they could remove Wilson and West's second passenger Jonathan Aguasvivas, who was wanted on unrelated domestic violence charges. According to the Boston Globe, West has a criminal record including multiple gun, drug and assault charges that go back 24 years. Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said it was important to release the video to show the community exactly what happened - and why ."

"Watching the first male skier to ever clinch four straight World Cup titles fly through snowcapped slopes is impressive enough. But talented Marcel Hirscher added a little extra flare to his downhill slalom run by bringing the pistes alive with a colourful display. The skier teamed up with The Red Bull Media House and Starelation to create the unusual stunt, using coloured powder packed into the poles he swerved around. Rainbow run! Marcel Hirscher performs during the project 'Marcel Hirscher Colours' at Reiteralm near Schladming . Blue eruption! The coloured powder was flung across the slopes as the talented skier went passed . 'It was a surreal experience – simply amazing!' said the four times World Champion skier, Marcel Hirscher . 'We wanted to bring a new, cool element into skiing,' Hirscher said on the Red Bull website' The process involved 11 cameras, a specially-enhanced slope, and three days to set up before creating the incredible video in one take with the 26-year-old Austrian. Marcel Hirscher slalomed in and out of poles filled to the brim with coloured, biodegradable powder, which erupted upon contact. Six GoPros, and a range of other cameras, including a hand held one by the skier captured the dazzling rainbow effect, which surrounded him at every turn. As the run required more ice than snow, a section of the Reiteralm slopes in Austria had to be watered, so that it could freeze over night in preparation. The team had to get up at 4am to set up the cameras to capture the rainbow run in one take from a number of angles, before the ice melted. The most difficult part of the incredible video as filming it from all angles, without getting another cameraman in the shot. 'We wanted to bring a new, cool element into skiing,' Hirscher said on the Red Bull website, 'and create unforgettable images. And I think we succeeded!' 'It was a surreal experience – simply amazing! I couldn't ski with the speed I normally do in races, even though the course was very steep in the first part, up to 75 percent incline,' he explains. 'At each gate I was blinded for a split second because I had to ski through a cloud of yellow and blue.' The team had to get up at 4am to set up the cameras to capture the rainbow run from a number of angles, before the ice melted during the day . The biodegradable powder was placed in slalom poles along the course, and multiple cameras were set up to capture the effect from different angles . Rainbow powder! After winning the overall World Cup title four years in a row, alpine skier Marcel Hirscher took a day off and had some fun at his local resort with his race skiis and some crazy colors, resulting in one of the most vibrant ski runs to date . Talented! This year the skier became the first men's skier ever to clinch a fourth straight World Cup overall title . Respect for the environment was a priority from the beginning of this project! The team has assured that the plants and wildlife have neither been damaged nor disturbed at any time during the project . Marcel's explosive slalom run is a Red Bull Media House production realised by Starelation . Record achievement! This year Hirscher became the first male alpine skier to win the overall World Cup title four times in a row . Respect for the environment was a priority from the beginning of this project! The team has assured that the plants and wildlife have neither been damaged nor disturbed at any time during the project . Now your usual slope! The team picked vibrant colours which would contrast heavily with the crisp white snow . The team wanted to get as close as they could to the skier but without any cameramen appearing in any shots . One chance! The team knew they had one attempt to get the shot, as once the powder had been released it would ruin any other shots . Born in Annaberg-Lungötz, Salzburg, Hirscher made his World Cup debut in March 2007 . Marcel's father Ferdinand Hirscher said on his website: 'Marcel and I have been travelling to various races since his childhood. I contribute with my experience from this. I make sure that we – together with the coaches and the service crew – get to the maximum as a team.' The talented skier has 30 pairs of ski boots and 100 pairs of Atomic Redster racing skies prepared for use before every season . Impressive feat! The team took three days to prepare, shoot and edit the colourful video . Success! Marcel Hirscher poses for a portrait during the project 'Marcel Hirscher Colours,' with the colourful slopes in the background ."

"The 32-year-old, who joined the Black Cats until the end of the season on 9 March, was given the ban after failing to pay money owed to a former agent.
Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce said the club were ""completely in the dark"" over the dispute which started in July 2013.
""I'm massively disappointed like everyone else is,"" said Allardyce.
Media playback is not supported on this device
The Sunderland manager added: ""The problem is what has happened in the past has caught up with Emmanuel, for whatever the reason.
""He has got a ban and the contract gets terminated on that basis.""
Sunderland are 18th in the Premier League - two points from safety with eight games left - and face West Brom at the Stadium of Light on Saturday (15:00 BST).
Allardyce did suggest ""there could be a way back"" for Eboue, if he resolves the dispute. The Ivory Coast international has two weeks to appeal against the decision.
""He has relied on other people and other people have let him down,"" added Allardyce.
Eboue, who has not made a first team appearance for the Black Cats, had been ordered by Fifa to pay agent Sebastien Boisseau an undisclosed amount he was entitled to under the terms of an agreement between the pair.
The former Arsenal full-back was fined 30,000 Swiss francs (£21,000) in September 2014 and given four months to settle the matter.
Eboue spent eight seasons at the Gunners after arriving from Belgian side Beveren in 2004, before moving to Turkey, where he won three Super Lig titles and five domestic trophies with Galatasaray.
He began training with Sunderland in February.
Ghanaian football agent Oliver Arthur told BBC World Service that it was ""very disappointing"" that Eboue had got ""into this mess"". He said the situation sometimes occurs when a player moves to a bigger agent and forgets to pay their previous representative.
Arthur said the ban was ""fantastic"" news for agents because it showed they can ""take your case to a higher level"".
""Now it's very easy to refer a player to a case like this and it's easy for them to understand. A lot of players will now think twice in their decisions, think twice in keeping money and waiting to pay. Agents fees aren't so big that players should get themselves into this mess.""
Allardyce was speaking for the first time since ex-Sunderland winger Adam Johnson was jailed for child sex offences last week.
The 28-year-old had been allowed to continue to play for the club, before being sacked when he pleaded guilty to two offences at the start of his trial. He has lodged an appeal against his conviction for a third offence of sexual touching.
""We've lost a hugely talented player in Adam Johnson, irrespective of his indiscretions,"" said Allardyce.
""He obviously got what he deserved, but we've lost a talented player I would've liked to keep. But it was taken out of our hands by other factors."""

"The boy was found ""safe"" this afternoon and arrested on suspicion of wounding and carrying a bladed weapon.
Police said he was found on a train from Hereford to Malvern at 16:55 BST.
Detectives launched a search for the boy after the attack at Chase Technology College in Malvern, Worcestershire, at about 08:45 BST.
A male teacher and 13-year-old girl suffered minor injuries.
The boy was apprehended at Ledbury station in Herefordshire.
Leah Johnson, 16, a former pupil of Chase College, was travelling on the train when it stopped at Ledbury.
She said an officer was waiting on the platform for the boy, who had been standing near the train doors for around 15 minutes.
""The policeman was pacing up and down. The doors opened and he just said 'can you come with me?' and he walked off with him,"" she said.
The boy remains in custody at Worcester Police Station.
Earlier, there were police officers stationed at each entrance to the school and crime scene tape blocking off the main entrance.
Children were brought out individually from the school and handed to parents waiting at the gates. About 100 had gathered by lunchtime."
"Forty workers have been made redundant at Nelson Packaging's factory in Lancashire.
Managing director Michael Flynn said it was mainly due to ""the English bag legislation and corresponding impact on customer and retailer demand"".
He also blamed ""aggressive overseas competition"".
The 5p charge for bags was introduced in England in October and followed the introduction of charges in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.
One worker told BBC Radio Lancashire they believed the legislation had a ""slight but not a massive impact"" on the business, which has been operating since 1975 and was taken over by Cheshire-based packaging firm Intelipac three years ago.
7.6 billion
Number of plastic bags issued by supermarkets in England in 2014
140
Equivalent per person
40 bags on average in every home
Â£780m expected economic benefit over 10 years because of the charge
Â£60m savings in litter clean up costs by 2025
80% expected reduction in bags
Union representative Robert Copeland, who had been with the firm since 1986, said staff were told last Wednesday that they were being made redundant and were told to leave the factory immediately.
""It's daunting as I have no interview skills. I'm 49 years old and I've got to now go into a new working environment and start again. It is scary.
""I was 19 when I started andâ€¦ you were seeing the children of people you have been working with for 30 years starting to come through so you had parents and children [at the factory].""
Campaigners argue that plastic bags blight streets, spoil the countryside and damage wildlife, seas and coastline.
Wales was the first UK nation to introduce the bag charges, followed by Northern Ireland and then Scotland.
A report in 2015 found the number of single-use carrier bags handed out by shops in Wales fell by 71% since charges were introduced in 2011.
Scotland and Northern Ireland introduced their charges in 2014 and 2013 respectively and also saw significant drops in usage.
The number of plastic bags handed out in Scottish stores was slashed by 80% - the equivalent of 650 million carriers - in the first year of the 5p charge.
Similarly, in Northern Ireland in 2014 there was a 42.6% annual reduction following a previous drop of 71%, after charges were introduced.
Does the charge include all carrier bags?"
"All Facebook users have them - those friends who are so in love with their newborn baby they clog up your news feed with constant doting updates. But one group of women were so fed up with their friend's 'running commentary' they went to the extreme measure of putting an anonymous letter in her mailbox demanding she give everyone 'a break'. Jade Ruthven, 33, of Perth, Western Australia, was shocked when she found the scathing note claiming to be from ‘a few of the girls’, cruelly criticising her for posting photos of her six-month-old daughter Addison on Facebook. ‘Dear Jade, I have got together with a few of the girls and we are all SO OVER your running commentary on your life and every single thing Addy does,’ the letter begins. ‘We all have kids that we are besotted with ... But we don’t ram it down everyone else’s neck!!!’ Jade Ruthven, 33, of Perth, Western Australia, was shocked when she found a scathing note  criticising her for posting too many photos of her six-month-old daughter Addison on Facebook . Jade Ruthven was devastated when she received the  unsigned letter in her mailbox . As the letter continues, the typos and punctuation become more intense and frequent. ‘She crawls off the mat – we DON”T care!!!!! She’s six months old – BIG DEAL!!!! ‘Stop and think – if every mother posted all that cr*p about their kid – I’m sure you’d get over it pretty quickly.’ The author claims the rant was written on behalf of everyone who views Jade’s Facebook posts. ‘I guess you are just p***ing a lot of people off with all your “Addy this and Addy that”. ‘We all thought it might ease off after the first month but it hasn’t,’ the letter continues. ‘Not everyone is as interested as you are about what Addy does so give us all a break. ‘We’re doing this to let you know what people really think.’ The dental hygienist still doesn’t know who was responsible for the letter. Jade can’t think why anybody would feel the need to be so nasty . Jade and her husband Ryan (pictured with their daughter Addison) were both very angry but chose to try and see the funny side of the ridiculous letter . Jade sent the letter to comedian Em Rusciano, who posted it to her Facebook page and described it as 'next-level mean' in an opinion piece for news.com.au. For Jade the letter came completely out of the blue and was like a slap in the face, particularly as she is a first-time mother trying to find her feet. ‘I was actually excited when I checked the mail and saw a hand written envelope thinking it was an invite. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect what was in it!’ Jade told Daily Mail Australia. ‘At first I was in shock and thought this letter must be a joke. I read it and re-read it about four times. ‘I was shaking with anger and shock to think a so-called friend of mine could be so heartless and gutless to not even sign their name.’ The dental hygienist still doesn’t know who was responsible for the letter. Jade can’t think why anybody would feel the need to be so nasty. ‘To be honest I have no idea why anyone would do this to me. I don’t think I have had an enemy in my whole life,’ she said. ‘My husband Ryan was just as angry as me but we soon decided to laugh it off as a bad joke. Jade and her friends responded by creating the hashtag #Addyspam and cheekily posting a stream of photos of the beautiful bub on Facebook - sending a strong message to the hateful author . Jade was accused of 'p***ing' everybody off by posting too many photos of her baby daughter on Facebook . ‘These people clearly have too much time on their hands to sit and chat about my Facebook usage. It’s quite sad really.’ The cruel nature of the letter spurred Jade to stand up for herself. She refused to bow down to the bullies. ‘To have someone do this to me, in truth, makes me feel sick,’ said Jade. ‘Lucky for me I am a strong, healthy person. Being a first time mum is hard enough to get your head around but for someone who was feeling alone or who was struggling with the challenges of motherhood this could have had terrible consequences. ‘But it takes a lot more to keep me down than a nasty letter!’ Jade wants the coward author to know their nasty act has not brought her down. She has also vowed to continue to post photos of her treasured baby. ‘I have had people contact me saying if this had happened to them at this time in their bub’s life, it would have sent them over the edge. ‘I am glad I was the one that got this letter, not someone in a more vulnerable state.’ Jade says the attempt to shame and isolate her has ‘backfired’, as she is ‘feeling more loved and supported than ever’ Jade insists that not for one minute did she consider changing her behaviour on Facebook. Instead, she decided to deal with the bullies with a sense of humour. ‘No way did I feel self-conscious or consider changing my online activity,’ she said. 'That’s how I think this person can’t be that close to me. If they were they would know I would never take this lying down, start crying in the corner and then take myself off Facebook. ’In fact my friends and I started a hashtag, #Addyspam and posted pics of Addy on Facebook all night long!’ Jade says the attempt to shame and isolate her has ‘backfired’, as she is ‘feeling more loved and supported than ever’. Rather, it is an opportunity for her to set an example for her daughter and support other new mothers . ‘The support I have received from family, friends and even total strangers has blown me away.’ Facebook is a crucial tool for Jade and Ryan to share their daughter’s life with their distant relatives. ‘Addy’s grandparents and a lot of family and friends live overseas. Facebook is the only way they can really keep in touch.’ As a mother, Jade knew she didn’t want to stoop to the bullies’ level. Rather, it is an opportunity for her to set an example for her daughter and support other new mothers. ‘I want my daughter to grow up a strong and confident girl and if she ever does encounter bullies. ‘I want her to feel strong enough to stand up for herself. ‘Also I think parents should do what feels right for you and your bub. ‘Everyone will try and give you their opinions, just smile and nod!’"
"Kitted out: Mr Carney out running in Hyde Park . Just how many water bottles does a man need when running? If you’re the governor of the Bank of England, the answer seems to be four. Mark Carney was spotted on a day off from helping to run the economy jogging in London’s Hyde Park sporting a high-tech running belt with no fewer than four water bottles. The keen runner, who training for the London Marathon later this month, was wearing a Nathan Speed 4 Fuel Belt, which also features a zip pocket perfect for storing high-carb energy gel packs. The belt is available for $64.95 (£35) at Kintec, a Canadian sports retailer based in Vancouver, suggesting Mr Carney, originally from Canada, bought it before he moved to the UK. He was also wearing headphones and top-of-the range running shoes. His adidas Energy Boost ESM Shoes, in green and black, cost £120. According to the manufacturer, ‘more boost beneath your feet means more fuel in your tank’. They feature a ‘form-fitting techfit® upper’ which is ‘engineered for natural, flexible support and a seamless, sock-like fit’, the firm’s website states. Mr Carney, in charge of the world’s sixth largest economy, completed his look with a grey jumper, which was drenched in sweat by the end of his training session. The father of four daughters, who turned 50 last week, is known to be a keen sportsman and likes to keep fit. At Harvard, he played in goal for his ice hockey team. In 2011, he completed in Canada’s Ottawa marathon, finishing the 26.2-mile sprint in just three hours and 48 minutes in 2011 – an hour and 40 minutes shy of the winning time that year. He continued running when he moved to London to become the Bank of England chief in 2013, and is known to sometimes run from his home to Bank’s headquarters in the City of London to avoid the traffic. ‘Like many other Londoners I do run to work or home from work from time to time,’ he said in an interview. He will be running the London Marathon in aid of Cancer Research UK, a Bank of England spokesman announced in January.

"About Â£11m will be spent on the upgrade at the Hearts ground. The current main stand was built in 1919.
The club hopes work will begin next month.
Hearts owner Ann Budge said last month that she hoped the work would be completed in September 2017. The new stand will increase the capacity to more than 7,200 from 4,720.
Ms Budge said the current stand was still useable but not up to the standards that fans expect.
The plans involve demolishing large sections of the existing main stand, and the ticket offices and shops."
"Cover your ears now or turn down your volume! This is the moment a disgruntled French Bulldog continually honks a horn after being left alone in a car.

He swiftly whipped out his camera phone to film the canine at the wheel. Footage shows the animal standing up with his front paws firmly pressed on the horn.

Yet this adaptation is completely faithful to the traditional story - including wicked stepmother, fairy godmother, glass slipper, handsome prince and happy ending.
British actress Lily James, best known as Lady Rose from ITV's Downton Abbey, stars as Cinderella. Cate Blanchett plays the stepmother and Helena Bonham Carter is the fairy godmother.
""Keeping it classic is the twist,"" says Branagh, who started his directing career in 1989 with his adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry V.
""I always felt that it's better to do a modern version of a story using the historical perspective, than say, make a story of Cinderella in Brooklyn in 2015.
""I find that when you try and update Shakespeare to a contemporary setting too, you always pay a price.
""In this case, the original material of Cinderella is far richer than my ideas, so it seems to me that it's my job to make it simple. Just let the fairytale speak, because it affects us in a more complicated way than we think.
""Audiences have already come up to me saying the film is about patchwork families, about child bereavement, about the politics between women these days. Fairytales are a psychological brain-worm that need to be left alone to do their work.""
Helena Bonham Carter says that at first she was dubious ""as to whether a straight version would work"".
""I think it's a really good film, but it could so easily have been bad. I was saying: 'So you're really going to do a completely straight version of Cinderella? No gimmicks, no extra frills, no 3D?'
""It's very classic, but they know me, and they allowed me not to be that straight in my own role.""
Just as audiences seem to have taken to the film, critics such as the Guardian's Guy Lodge comment that ""while it might have been nice to see the new-model Cinderella follow Frozen's progressive, quasi-feminist lead, the film's naff, preserved-in-amber romanticism is its very charm"".
But James disagrees that this Cinderella is an old-fashioned heroine, pointing out that at the start of Disney's 1950 classic, Cinderella ""is staring out of the window dreaming of the prince and waiting for him to rescue her"".
""This Cinderella doesn't do that at all. I think we make it very clear that everything she does is her choice - even deciding to stay on at her parents' house with such wicked treatment from her stepmother.
""She is told by her dying mother to 'have courage and be kind' and this is the film's, and Cinderella's, backbone.""
This is the first major leading role for Surrey-born James. ""Not even a big TV series like Downton could prepare me for this fuss,"" she says.
""I am getting slightly carried away. I keep seeing giant posters of me all over the place in a big blue dress and people shouting my name.
""I'm trying to enjoy the magic actually - this is the fairytale aspect of it for me, personally. It's quite something that so many little girls are going to think I'm Cinderella.""
James has dismissed speculation that her waist had been digitally altered to make it smaller as ""irrelevant"", claiming that fans were interested in Cinderella because of her ""morals"".
Cate Blanchett agrees that the core of the film is ""kindness"", adding that it is ""an unusual quality these days. There's not a cynical bone in this film's body and that's its strength.
""There is cruelty and jealousy in the movie too, but too often we don't value kindness. In today's world you think someone who is kind is a doormat, and the fact this triumphs is really heart-warming.""
Branagh, who previously directed Marvel's Thor, describes kindness ""as its own super-power. It is a dark world and children do need to understand they need courage and resilience to get through it.
""People often compare the story of Shakespeare's King Lear in relation to Cinderella. There is a resemblance there - a father making a tragic error and three daughters; great cruelty and great kindness.
""This film is all about the difficult but simple choice to be good and kind. Whether you're dealing with Shakespeare or the great fairy stories, they are all great big metaphors for human nature.
""And regardless of what happens to this film version, I believe this is why the tale of Cinderella will keep enduring.""
Cinderella is out in the UK on 27 March."
"A mother-of-two claims her face was left covered in angry red welts after drinking a bottle of Tesco wine which reeked of bleach. Justine Jones was left covered in huge sores and in agony after opening the bottle of Tesco Finest Garnacha wine to celebrate her daughter's birthday. Her mother Jan Jones had bought the bottle for granddaughter Abi's 18th birthday and they had poured a glass to toast the occasion. Justine Jones was left covered in huge sores and in agony after opening the bottle of Tesco Finest Garnacha wine to celebrate her daughter's birthday . But despite the bottle being sealed and showing no evidence of being tampered with, the family were shocked when they inspected it further and found it contained a clear liquid which smelt of bleach. Mother-of-two Ms Jones, 44, said: 'It tasted foul. I inspected the bottle and found that the liquid was clear and had bits of mucus and bits floating in it. 'My daughters and mum smelt the liquid and thought it had a faint smell of bleach. We were horrified.' Despite the bottle being sealed and showing no evidence of being tampered with, the family were shocked when they inspected it further and found it contained a clear liquid which smelt of bleach . The accountant, from Shropshire, suffers from rare condition pemphigus, which means her immune system is extremely sensitive to certain chemicals and attacks her body leaving serious blisters. The next day she was covered in huge sores and had to be referred to hospital. The bottle, bought from a Tesco branch in Market Weighton, East Yorkshire, was taken back by her mother who demanded it be tested and investigated. She said: 'I felt alarmed, Justine has such a poor immune system we have to be careful really.' A letter from the supermarket giant said a report had been sent to their technologist and that the wine had been provided by a supplier. Tesco wrote: 'The technologist acts as a regulator, and will follow it up with the people who make this product for us, as well as keeping an eye on all incoming complaints.' But Mrs Jones said the response was not good enough. 'I feel awful about their response. They sent me £10 and a £15 moneycard'.

'I wasn't looking for money, I wanted a result. I suspected it was cleaning fluid.' Her daughter added: 'We were incensed. This is particularly worrying as our product had obviously been tampered with and caused me considerable pain.' A Tesco spokesperson said: 'We're sorry we let Mrs Jones down with our investigation. We take all complaints extremely seriously, our team will be looking at what went wrong to ensure it doesn't happen again.'"
"More than 20,000 foreign fighters have fled to Syria and Iraq, turning the region into an ‘international finishing school’ for jihadists, an alarming report found. Fighters from 100 nations – more than half the countries in the world – have joined militant groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State, according to research by the United Nations. Worryingly, the report warned if IS was defeated in the war-torn region then the barbarous foreign fighters could be scattered across the world. Scroll down for video . More than 20,000 foreign fighters from more than half the countries in the world have joined militant groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State, according to a report by the United Nations . The number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by a staggering 71 per cent between the middle of 2014 and March 2015 after IS gained significant territory. Syria and Iraq were by far the biggest destinations, with over 20,000 foreign fighters travelling to the region to fight for mainly IS but also the Al-Nusra Front. The panel said the thousands of foreign fighters who travelled to both countries are living and working in ‘a veritable “international finishing school” for extremists’ as was the case in Afghanistan in the 1990s. Afghan security forces estimated in March – three months after British troops withdrew - that about 6,500 foreign fighters were active in the country. And it said hundreds of foreigners are fighting in Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, around 100 in Somalia, and others in the Sahel countries in northern Africa, and in the Philippines. The panel of experts monitoring UN sanctions against Al-Qaeda said in the report that the scale of the problem has increased over the past three years and the flow of foreign fighters ‘is higher than it has ever been historically’. The number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by a staggering 71 per cent between the middle of 2014 and March 2015 after IS gained significant territory . The overall number of foreign terrorist fighters has ‘risen sharply from a few thousand ... a decade ago to more than 25,000 today,’ the panel said in the report to the UN Security Council. A military defeat of the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq could have the unintended consequence of scattering foreign terrorist fighters across the world, the panel said. It noted that the ‘watch list’ in Turkey - a key crossing point to Syria and Iraq - now includes 12,500 individuals. And while governments are focusing on countering the threat from fighters returning home, the panel said it’s possible that some may be traumatised by what they saw and need psychological help. Others may be recruited by criminal networks. The number of countries the fighters come from has also risen dramatically from a small group in the 1990s to over 100 today, including some that have never had previous links with Al-Qaeda associated groups, the panel said. It cited the ‘high number’of foreign fighters from Tunisia, Morocco, France and Russia, the increase in fighters from the Maldives, Finland and Trinidad and Tobago, and the first fighters from some countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Syria and Iraq were by far the biggest destinations, with fighters mainly travelling to the region to fight for  IS but also the Al-Nusra Front (pictured, a fighter from the Al-Qaeda linked militant group) The panel said the fighters and their networks ‘pose an immediate and long-term threat’ and ‘an urgent global security problem’ that needs to be tackled on many fronts and has no easy solution. With globalised travel, it said, the chance of a person from any country becoming a victim of a foreign terrorist attack ‘is growing, particularly with attacks targeting hotels, public spaces and venues’. But the panel noted that a longstanding terrorist goal is ‘generating public panic’ and stressed that the response needs to ‘be measured, effective and proportionate.’ It said the most effective policy is to prevent the radicalization, recruitment and travel of would-be fighters. The panel noted that less than 10 per cent of basic information to identify foreign fighters has been put in global systems and called for greater intelligence sharing."
"Steve Williams, of Flat Iron Heritage, contacted his local MP, Lindsay Hoyle, after families were blocked from visiting the Chorley Pals Memorial Site at Serre-les-Puisieux.
He claims they were obstructed by a farmer who owns land near the cemetery.
The BBC tried to contact Jean Louis Legrand but could not get a reply.
To reach the Pals' Battalions memorial at the Sheffield Memorial Park, which is owned by Sheffield City Council, visitors must use an unmade public right of way that crosses land owned Mr Legrand.
The path is owned by the town of Serre whilst the park itself is looked after and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC).
The commission's Director General Victoria Wallace said: ""We are very concerned about the situation at Serre, and urge any visitors encountering hostility or harassment to report it to the local authorities.
""We are working with the French government and local authorities to find long-term solutions, but meanwhile we urge caution when visiting, and we ask visitors not to inflame the situation by ignoring the parking restrictions.""
The dispute has forced Flat Iron Heritage to cancel visits.
Mr Williams, who has been making an annual trip to the area since 2002, said the situation was getting worse.
He said it has caused a ""great deal of distress"" to those travelling to visit the graves of loved ones.
Labour MP for Chorley Mr Hoyle has written to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson asking his department to investigate.

"Manhattan's Fifth Avenue was a sea of bizarre hats today as people celebrating Easter took to the streets in outlandish headgear. Whether they had just emerged from Mass, or were only there to bare their bonnets, the quintessential Big Apple thoroughfare thronged with color on Sunday afternoon. Bunny ears, eggs and flowers were among the more conservative adornments festooning the heads of New Yorkers as they milled around in a loose gaggle centered on St Patrick's Cathedral. Mad hatters: These parader-goers, pictured in front of St Patrick's Cathedral on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, were among the more conservative hat-wearers in the annual Easter parade . Flower power: One of these floral bonnets, pictured next to the Rockefeller Plaza, spouted bubbles into the sunny New York sky . Classic: Some churchgoers wore more somber and refined clothing to the Mass service at the Catholic cathedral . Feathery: This elaborate piece of headgear was sported by Doris Watlington at the Fifth Avenue parade on Sunday . One woman wore a large ship with blue sails on her head, while another sported an elaborate diorama based on the policies of Mayor Bill de Blasio. As well as Christians emerging from the service, led by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Jews, Hindus, agnostics and atheists joined the masses for a walk on the mild, sunny day. Roses, industrial-style black goggles, as well as moving rabbit puppets also featured in the display, which didn't just involve humans. Mary Ann Smith, a local hatmaker who wore the ship-shaped hat, said: 'It's all about versatility'. Explaining the design, she said: 'It's about sailing to new heights,' said Smith. She also created headpieces for two friends, one topped with a massive butterfly and another with a tropical umbrella dripping with felt balls and anchored to a bird's nest. Just feet from the parade, the trio was tending to last-minute finishing touches, adding bobby pins to make sure the contraptions didn't topple. Kirsten Lee Sergeant, who wore the butterfly, said: 'It's Easter and I didn't want to be too garish. But then again, I do have a huge butterfly on my head!' Ship-shape: Hat-maker Mary Anna Smith wears an Easter bonnet featuring a blue ship, which she fashioned from an elaborate kite . Elaborate rabbit: This puppet bunny was another of the out-there headpieces seen strutting down Fifth Avenue . Commentary: This woman's hat was a diorama inspired by the city's mayor, Bill de Blasio . Starting young: Maelie Swanson, held by her father Jeff, enjoyed the chance to put her bunny ears on parade . Onesie becomes twosie: This rabbit enthusiast was captured next to a mirrored building on the New York street . In bloom: These colorful headpieces were typical among the revelers . Eggstravagant: These two women took the egg theme to its logical conclusion, wearing depictions in cooked and raw form . The 2015 Easter Parade bore little resemblance to the first one, which started in the 1880s as a strolling display of what prosperous New Yorkers wore to Fifth Avenue churches. In recent decades, the street gathering has morphed into a sort of costume circus - including pet dogs. A sizable subsection of dogs also sported elaborate Easter costumes, painstakingly designed by their owners - although some were so heavy they animals had to be carried around rather than walk. Carmen, a 4lbs Chihuahua, was not exactly happy with her getup. 'She didn't love this one because it's kind of heavy, and she won't walk in it. But if I carry her, she's fine,' said owner Melissa Mejias. A consultant to the city's Department of Education, Mejias dabbles in dog attire. She used a Simplicity pattern to sew Carmen's coat from one of her old shirts, adorning it with a flowery headband plus a necklace purchased from a company that makes accessories for tweens. And to make sure she didn't run off into the dense crowds, Mejias kept her on a bejeweled leash. As for Mejias, she wore her mother-in-law's old Easter hat to the parade, a dark red velvet one she'd pulled out of a closet. 'I'm carrying on that tradition,' said Mejias. Dog squad: Carmen the Chihuahua poses with owneer Melissa Mejias at the parade. She was apparently not a big fan of the floral outfit, and won't walk with it on . Easter puppy: These two dogs seemed happier with their colorful wings and hats as they joined in with their owners . Kids, too: Sasha Bryant, left, and her sister India were also along for the parade, with relatively restrained toppings . Loopy: Davey Mitchell poses for photographs as he takes part in the Easter Parade . Rising roses: Pata Luna Llano poses for photographs with her elaborate, wireframe decoration . Back in black: Markus Kelle departed from the bright color scheme, opting for goggle-style shades, a black plume and purple lipstick . Keeping it straight: Terrie Furukawa, right, reties the hat of her aunt Yotsuko Sakamoto as they take part in the parade ."
"Investigations are continuing into why the vehicle ploughed into Catherine Bonner's flat in Main Road, Fairlie, at about 13:45 on Thursday.
The A78 through the village is expected to remain closed until early next week.
A 55-year-old man who also lived in the flats continues to be treated for minor injuries at Inverclyde Royal Hospital.
He and the driver were rescued by the emergency services from the rubble. The 54-year-old driver has been released after treatment.
The lorry has been removed from the building and has been taken away to undergo further tests that will help establish the cause of the crash.
North Ayrshire Council said it was working with contractors and engineers to ensure that the properties affected ""are made safe"".
""Engineers and contractors have started work to secure the affected buildings and it is expected that a partial demolition may be required to ensure the site is made safe,"" the council said in a statement.
""The council has agreed that contractors can work into and through the night, if necessary.
""It is hoped that this will allow the A78 to re-open early next week.""
The council said it had arranged for letters to be delivered to all 600 households in Fairlie informing them of the situation and making them aware that some noise disturbance is likely through the night while work is ongoing.
The statement added: ""The council has apologised in advance for any disturbance which may be caused.""
Fairlie Community Council has been campaigning for road improvements in the area.
It has argued that the route is not suitable for traffic that includes lorries heading to Hunterston power station.
Councillor John Ferguson, North Ayrshire Council's cabinet member for infrastructure, said: ""While responsibility for management of the A78 trunk road lies with Transport Scotland, the council has lobbied - and will continue to lobby - for improvements to the road.
""A draft version of the North Ayrshire Local Plan, published in 2003, called on the (then) Scottish Executive to 'fully assess the need for further improvements on the trunk road network and bring forward schemes at the earliest possible date for the A78 coastal route'.
""While the specific reference to a Fairlie by-pass was removed at the request of the Scottish Executive's reporter, the council's aspiration for improvement schemes along the A78 coastal route remains."""
"Jeremy Clarkson has agreed to keep quiet about his sacking from the BBC so the Top Gear Live shows can go ahead 'in good spirit'. The global tour of the motoring show looked like it may face the axe following Clarkson's hotel fracas with a producer over a steak dinner. The BBC decided not to renew his contract and cancelled what remained of the latest series of Top Gear, but the corporation and the presenter have reached an agreement over the remaining live shows. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson has agreed to keep quiet about his sacking from the BBC so the Top Gear Live shows (pictured) can go ahead 'in good spirit' BBC Worldwide, which shares ownership rights of Top Gear, feared Clarson would vent his anger at his sacking during the live shows, the Sunday People reported. But he has agreed to keep quiet on his sacking so the shows can go ahead, meaning fans who have already booked tickets, thought to number almost 100,000, will not be disappointed. However the shows have been rebranded from Top Gear Live to Clarkson, Hammond and May Live. They will not feature any Top Gear branding, show any footage from the programmes or feature The Stig. A source said: 'Jeremy, James and Richard agreed to the terms put to them to let the shows go ahead in a good spirit. They were desperate not to let the fans down. 'Part of the deal was that neither the BBC nor the Top Gear brand would be brought into disrepute. 'Effectively this meant gagging Jeremy from mentioning what had gone on. But he agreed to comply.' Clarkson has agreed to keep quiet on his sacking so the shows can go ahead, meaning fans who have already booked tickets will not be disappointed . The global tour of the motoring looked like it faced the axe following Clarkson's hotel fracas with producer Oisin Tymon over a steak dinner . Clarkson, 54, is said to be 'champing at the bit' to get back on stage, with the next show taking place in Belfast in May. The tour will also see him travel to South Africa, Australia and Norway - where shows were cancelled while the BBC was deciding whether or not to sack the presenter. It will come to a close on November 29 at the O2 in London, with the futures of co-stars Richard Hammond and James May unclear. The pair's faces, along with Clarkson's, have both been removed from the top of Top Gear website. Meanwhile the two final episodes of Top Gear - which were canned after the hotel bust-up - could be made from footage shot before the controversial presenter left, but insiders say they can never be screened. The programmes are thought to show the presenters racing limousines and driving classic convertibles, but are not likely to ever see the light of day. BBC Worldwide did not comment."
"Discount store Aldi’s astonishing success story continued yesterday as it overtook upmarket rival Waitrose to become the sixth biggest supermarket in Britain. The German discounter has won an increasing share of the market since the recession as cash-strapped families look for cheaper alternatives. It now lags behind only the ‘big four’ – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons – and the Co-operative. Growth: Discount chain Aldi now has a bigger market share than upmarket supermarket Waitrose . Major supermarkets have slashed prices in recent months to fend off competition from cut-price rivals such as Aldi and Lidl. Despite this Aldi has lifted its market share from 4.6 per cent to 5.3 per cent in the past three months. Waitrose has 5.1 per cent of the market, up from 5 per cent, according to consumer research firm Kantar Worldpanel. Lidl claimed recently that Britain’s middle classes had become the ‘Lidl Classes’ after sales rose by a fifth in a year. But while Lidl remains eighth behind Waitrose, Aldi is now one of Britain’s mainstream supermarkets. Between January and the end of March, Aldi sales grew by 17 per cent from the same time a year earlier. This compares to 3 per cent growth for Waitrose, lifting its share of the market. The total market share of the ‘big four’ fell below 73 per cent, the lowest for a decade. Aldi – motto Spend a little. Live a lot – stocks virtually all own-branded goods and offers a far smaller selection of goods. By contrast middle-class rival Waitrose, part of the John Lewis Partnership, focuses on customer service and high-quality produce. Increase: Consumer research firm Kantar Worldpanel said Aldi sales grew by 17 per cent from January and the end of March compared to the same time a year earlier, compared to 3 per cent growth for Waitrose . Aldi has 560 stores and hopes to double in size by 2022. Yesterday, it announced it was opening nine more stores in London, creating up to 600 jobs. Kantar Worldpanel said Aldi had recorded double-digit growth for the past four years. More than half a million new shoppers visited the store in the three months to March 29, compared to a year before. Lidl saw sales jump by almost 12 per cent over the period to secure a 3.7 per cent market share. This is some way off Tesco’s dominant 28.4 per cent share, followed by Asda at 17.1 per cent. But Fraser McKevitt, at Kantar Worldpanel, said the success of Aldi and Lidl meant the entire structure of the ‘supermarket landscape’ was changing. The price war between upmarket retailers and discounters has led to significantly cheaper food. The Office for National Statistics says food prices fell by more than 3 per cent in February compared to a year earlier. Aldi began as a small food store opened by miner’s wife Anna Albrecht in the German town of Essen in 1914 to support the family when her husband became ill."

"Aiden Webb, 22, from Norwich, was climbing Fansipan mountain alone on Friday when he fell down a ravine and lost his way, his girlfriend Bluebell Baughan said.
Mr Webb, described as an experienced climber, was last heard from on Saturday when his phone went dead.
The Foreign Office confirmed it was assisting his family.
Mr Webb and Miss Baughan were on a four-month trip when he injured his arm and knee in the fall on the 3,100m (10,300ft) high Fansipan mountain in the north of Vietnam.
More on this and other stories from Norfolk
""He went to the mountain alone without a guide at 06:00 and aspired to climb it in one day,"" Miss Baughan said.
She was in touch with Mr Webb by phone when he informed her he had fallen and could not find his way back to the trail.
""He was sure he could make it back but by nightfall it was apparent he wasn't going to,"" she said.
""Aiden said a rock had cut his arm open and he had hurt his knee. We were in touch all night.
""He said no-one would be able to find him, but by 6am on Saturday he finally agreed to me getting help.""
Miss Baughan, who is helping co-ordinate the search from the town of Sa Pa, said rescuers had been on the mountain since Saturday morning.
""Thirty-two men spent last night on the mountain, a mixture of military police, forestry workers and local police.
""There is only one police officer here in Sa Pa who speaks English, but everyone has been very helpful,"" she said.
Miss Baughan said conditions on the mountain were ""very cold and wet"".
""Aiden is a very good climber, but he is injured,"" she said.
Mr Webb's father and uncle are expected to arrive in Vietnam this evening although they will not reach the north until Tuesday.

"Amina Ali Nkeki, 19, was found with a baby by an army-backed vigilante group on Tuesday in the huge Sambisa Forest, close to the border with Cameroon.
She was one of 219 pupils missing since they were abducted from a secondary school in eastern Chibok in April 2014.
They were taken by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram.
Amina was reportedly recognised by a civilian fighter of the Civilian Joint Task Force (JTF), a vigilante group set up to help fight Boko Haram.
She was with a suspected Boko Haram fighter who is now in the Nigerian military's custody. Named as Mohammed Hayatu, he said he was Amina's husband.
Aboku Gaji, leader of the JTF in Chibok:
""The moment this girl was discovered by our vigilantes, she was brought to my house. I instantly recognised her, and insisted we should take her to her parents.
""When we arrived at the house... I asked the mother to come and identify someone. The moment she saw her, she shouted her name: 'Amina, Amina!' She gave her the biggest hug ever, as if they were going to roll on the ground, we had to stabilise them.
""The mother called the attention of other relations to come out and see what is happening. The girl started comforting the mother, saying: 'Please Mum, take it easy, relax. I never thought I would ever see you again, wipe your tears. God has made it possible for us to see each other again.'
""Afterwards, we had to make them understand that the girl would not be left in their care. She must be handed over to the authority.""
Interview with BBC Hausa service
Amina and her baby have been taken to taken to the regional capital Maiduguri for medical attention, the military said.
A spokesman for Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari said the rescued young woman would be brought to meet the head of state, before being helped to reintegrate into society.

Hosea Abana Tsambido, the chairman of the Chibok community in the capital, Abuja, told the BBC that Amina had been found after venturing into the forest to search for firewood.
""She was sayingâ€¦ all the Chibok girls are still there in the Sambisa except six of them that have already died.""
By Will Ross, BBC News
Amina was found by a local vigilante group out on a routine patrol.
These groups, which have played a vital role in the fight against Boko Haram, sprang up in 2013 in the main city of north-east Nigeria, Maiduguri.
It was a desperate measure at a terrible time when the jihadists were winning the war, seizing territory whilst reports of soldiers fleeing rather than fighting were common.
More vigilante groups then sprang up across the north-east and, with local knowledge of the terrain, they had some success stopping their homes from being taken over - even though they were armed with just rudimentary weapons.
As the Nigerian military started getting its act together at the beginning of 2015, with help from outside, it started retaking territory and in some areas worked effectively with the vigilantes.
There is, however, great concern that as peace returns the vigilantes - who have tasted power - pose a danger themselves.
During the April 2014 attack, Boko Haram gunmen arrived in Chibok late at night, then raided the school dormitories and loaded 276 girls on to trucks.
More than 50 managed to escape within hours, mostly by jumping off the lorries and running off into roadside bushes.
A video broadcast by CNN in April this year appeared to show some of the kidnapped schoolgirls alive.
Fifteen girls in black robes were pictured. They said they were being treated well but wanted to be with their families.
The video was allegedly shot on Christmas Day 2015 and some of the girls were identified by their parents.
The Chibok schoolgirls, many of whom are Christian, had previously not been seen since May 2014, when Boko Haram released a video of about 130 of them gathered together reciting the Koran.
The abduction led to the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, which was supported by US First Lady Michelle Obama and Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai.

"Mark Selby fell victim of the Crucible curse and a rookie Scot with pots of class as Anthony McGill pulled off a monumental Betfred World Championship shock. Qualifier McGill exuded calm assurance as he saw off the defending champion 13-9 to book a quarter-final place, never appearing overawed by the match or the gradual position of control he developed over the course of Friday. This is McGill's first World Championship and it had already been one to remember before he crossed cues with Selby, having beaten his fellow Glaswegian and sometime practice partner Stephen Maguire 10-9 in the opening round, finishing with a century. Anthony McGill celebrates beating Mark Selby during day seven of the Betfred World Championships . Sinking Selby made it even more special, and now the sky is the limit for the 24-year-old, who has been quietly earmarked for greatness by those who know him best. Former Crucible semi-finalist Alan McManus, a close friend and a steady hand on McGill's shoulder, has tipped the former Junior Pot Black runner-up to take the trophy in Sheffield one day, and Ronnie O'Sullivan said there would be no worthier champion because of his dedication. In 2005, Shaun Murphy came through qualifying and went on to lift the title. Tantalisingly Murphy could be next in line for McGill, a slender, shy man with a short ginger crop and a contagious giggle he often breaks into around the table. Selby, the Jester from Leicester, found little to laugh about during their contest. Like Murphy 10 years ago, McGill was a 150/1 outsider with bookmakers before the tournament began. McGill was the architect of Selby's demise, but the famous curse, which has at the very least become a factor lodged in the back of every first-time champion's mind, will be cited too. Selby (left) congratulates McGill on his victory during day seven of the Betfred World Championships . No maiden winner of the World Championship in Sheffield has returned a year later to retain the trophy, with Selby becoming the 16th man to falter, joining a list that includes greats of the game such as Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry and O'Sullivan. A steady opening session on Thursday had seen he and McGill reach 4-4, but the Scot stretched 10-6 clear by lunch on Friday after firing breaks of 56, 125 and 54, and there was no flinching from the outsider when play resumed in the evening. They shared the opening two frames, before 87 from McGill took him 12-7 clear, inflicting a mortal blow to Selby's prospects. McGill sets his sights on the white has he plays his way to victory against Selby at the Crucible . When Selby edged the next he at least had the thinking time the subsequent interval allowed, knowing he needed a further five frames without reply to extend his defence. He re-emerged with a break of 101 to make it 12-9 and keep McGill waiting. But not for long. After a safety battle, McGill potted a terrific red to the middle pocket and was away on a victory charge, firing in a brilliant 82 before Selby offered a warm handshake. McGill said: 'I'm just ecstatic. To beat the world champion at the Crucible, I just can't believe it . 'No-one expected me to win. I wasn't expecting myself to win, I was just hoping to put up a decent fight and try my best. Selby's facial expressions say iy all as he crashes out of the World Championship at the Crucible . 'I knew if I gave everything my mind would have been at ease whatever the result . 'To beat Mark 13-9 is just a dream. I knew it wasn't over even when it went 12-7. He's not world champion for nothing. 'Time and time again Mark Selby comes back at people, and better players than me. 'It seems like every time I win a game it's the biggest win of my career. Fingers crossed it keeps happening.' McGill will be careful not to let his mind drift beyond a last-eight clash with Murphy or Joe Perry, who begin their second-round clash on Sunday. Snooker player Selby in action against Anthony McGill during day seven of the Betfred World Championships . 'I've knocked out the world champion, so you think whoever knocks him out could (win the title) - but I don't know,' McGill said. 'It's going all right but I'm not winning enough frames in one visit. There's a few areas I need to brush up on before I start thinking about those things. 'I don't think people will be fearing me. 'I'm probably a good draw in the quarter-finals of the World Championship to be honest. I'll just go out and try my best. 'Some players might let the attention get to their head but not me.' McGill takes a shot on his way to victory against Selby at the Crucible in Sheffield ."
"Sally Chidzoy said she was targeted after raising concerns when an MP appeared to convince a senior colleague to drop one of her stories.
She further alleges she was ""falsely imprisoned"" by management during an attempt to seize her phone.
Ms Chidzoy also claims she was sexually discriminated against and victimised.
The tribunal in Cambridge was told Ms Chidzoy, who works as BBC Look East's home affairs correspondent, had been investigating East of England Ambulance Service boss Anthony Marsh's salary package.
She said the story was dropped after assistant editor Steve Silk received a late-night email from then-Liberal Democrat health minister Norman Lamb in July 2014.
Sent from a private account, it noted Mr Lamb's ""real concern about the potential damage"" the story could have on the service.
Giving evidence, Ms Chidzoy said she had discovered a ""very close"" relationship between Mr Lamb and Dr Marsh and she felt the MP was ""attempting, in my view, to stop a broadcast"".
""He should not be doing this and leaning on the BBC and its duty to be impartial and independent.
""[It was] a direct attempt to interfere with an ongoing piece that had not yet been broadcast.""
Representing the BBC, Sophie Belgrave disputed the suggestion Mr Silk had been influenced by the email, saying he would have done it in a ""clandestine"" way had this been the case.
She said: ""If he was going to give in to political interference from Norman Lamb on the sly, they would just do it.""
Disciplinary proceedings were launched against Ms Chidzoy after she raised the issue of the MP's interference and after an email from Mr Lamb to Mr Silk was leaked to a Sunday newspaper.
Bosses subsequently attempted to seize her phone and ""falsely imprisoned"" her at a meeting in September 2014, the tribunal was told.
Ms Chidzoy said she investigated another story about the Centre for Business and Public Sector Ethics, which was receiving money from the Chinese government.
She was informed BBC Look East editor Nikki O'Donnell was the ""organisation's press spokesperson"", the tribunal was told.
Ms Chidzoy said: ""The problems I encountered involved what I believe is internal corruption and poor management.""
She also alleges she was subjected to a covert investigation by ex-Met police officers at the BBC investigation unit while the proceedings were ongoing.
The tribunal continues."
"Stuart Broad came through an injury scare and Jonny Bairstow fell just short of a century against his own team-mates as England's Test warm-ups descended into a glorified training drill. Events at Lord's, where the decision was made to cull England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Paul Downton, seemed rather more relevant to the future of English cricket than the mix-and-match day at Warner Park, where four members of the touring party were parachuted in to bolster the local team. Jonathan Trott (nought) and Gary Ballance (17) largely failed to do so, but Bairstow made 98 and Joe Root ended the day 87 not out in a score of 303 for nine. England paceman Stuart Broad (left) bowls at Jonny Bairstow on Wednesday . It seemed entirely in keeping with the unsatisfactory nature of England's Test preparation week that Bairstow, the only member of the seconded quarter not likely to feature in the series, had the most productive day. At least Broad averted serious injury when he collapsed clutching his left ankle in the second over. Broad initially looked in trouble when his boot slid through the crease and he tumbled to the ground, and coach Peter Moores was concerned enough to stride out to the middle to assess the damage. But he spent just short of an hour off the field with an ice pack and later returned to the attack. Broad required lengthy treatment on the pitch after clutching his left ankle following his fall . Broad was concerned enough about the run-ups to summon the groundstaff the ball before coming to grief. He initially suggested bowling round the wicket in search of firmer footing but decided to go back to his original angle of attack after sawdust was applied. When he went down the game was just 10 balls old - the same number of deliveries that were possible in the infamous abandoned Test in Antigua six years ago. By that stage, the first of England's honorary Kittitians had already come and gone. England captain Alastair Cook (right) watches on as ground staff make running repairs to the crease . Trott opened the batting but lasted just three balls, guiding James Anderson straight to James Tredwell at third slip. That was hardly the added steel England were looking for. The same was largely true of Ballance, who seems short of his best after a troubled World Cup, and managed only 17 before an ill-judged cut against Tredwell ended up in Jos Buttler's gloves. Ben Stokes had earlier ripped out Shane Jeffers' middle stump and Tredwell had Sherwin Peters lbw offering no stroke. Bairstow, whose likely Test role is as Buttler's back-up, reached lunch on 33 not out in a score of 55 for four. Bairstow fell just short of a century against England on Wednesday . He continued to score briskly in the afternoon and was just two short of a ton when Stokes found his outside edge to have him caught behind. The game lacked all semblance of competitive edge, even as Root compiled a trouble-free half-century of his own, but there were some possible pointers ahead the first Test in Antigua. James Tredwell clearly outbowled Adil Rashid in the race for the spinner's role and Chris Jordan failed to take a wicket despite seeing plenty of the ball. He came into this game in pole position but could fall behind Liam Plunkett or Mark Wood, who will open the bowling for St Kitts & Nevis on Thursday morning. Jonathan Trott opened the batting St Kitts & Nevis but lasted just three balls . Bairstow gave little away about dressing room reaction to Downton's departure, partly because he was ready to go out and bat as the news was delivered in the lunch interval. 'We just found out at lunch,. No-one said anything, it was straight back out and get on with our job out here in St Kitts,' he said. 'I don't know what the role entails or anything like that, it's a decision that's taken above us...I don't know what the job description is. 'It's our job out here to get on with the task at hand and win a series for England.'"
"Trading Standards officers working with sniffer dogs uncovered the illicit haul at six properties in the Freeman Street area of the town.
The cigarettes and tobacco would cost an estimated Â£200,00 if bought legally.
North East Lincolnshire Council's Trading Standards team said it was the largest haul since it began a crackdown on illicit products last year.
Prior to the latest haul, the team seized nearly 90,000 cigarettes and 181lbs (82.5kg) of tobacco since launching Operation Nightshade.
Councillor Terry Walker said: ""This is the most significant stash to have been uncovered during Operation Nightshade and is the result of a long-term, intelligence led campaign aimed at dishonest retailers who persist in flouting the law."""
"When Chelsea Clinton became the first daughter of the United States of America, she was just a twelve-year-old from Arkansas with a full head of voluminous frizzy curls. But over the years, as Chelsea has grown up into an intelligent and elegant woman, her curls quickly began to fade, appearing more and more controlled as the years wore on, before eventually vanishing completely. Now, in a candid interview with Elle magazine, Chelsea has finally revealed just what happened to her much-loved ringlets – insisting that, far from being an intentional style change, her once-unruly mane simply straightened itself out over time. Scroll down for video . All grown up: In the latest issue of Elle, Chelsea Clinton finally reveals to the world just what happened to her once-curly hair . Mystery solved: Chelsea's famous curls (pictured left in 1998) went from unmanageable frizz to tight ringlets, before fading into a fuller, wavier style (pictured right, in 2015) When asked by the magazine about what became of her 'pre-Raphaelite curls', Chelsea revealed: 'I don't actually have curly hair anymore.' 'My curls, in my early twenties, just fell into waves. I don't know if they got tired of me, but the curls slowly subsided, and so now it's naturally a little bit wavy but... I miss my curls. The 35-year-old daughter of Bill Clinton, the 42nd President of the United States, also talked about her marriage to investment banker Marc Mezvinsky in the new interview, as well as her role as a mother to her baby daughter Charlotte. Quite a change: Chelsea, pictured here at age 11 just a few months before her father Bill was elected president, was often the victim of bullying remarks over her unruly hair . Hillary's girl: Elle Editor-in-Chief Robbie Myers describes Chelsea as being 'innately regal' with 'a kind of grace that doesn't seem practiced' Visit site . We've watched her grow up in the White House to become a woman who commands much commending through her fiercely intelligent and graceful character.  Chelsea Clinton may be the first daughter again and she shows off her sleek grown up look on the cover of Elle Magazine in a Gucci dress from the spring 2015 collection. She's now a mother herself and dresses appropriately for her age in a chic little black dress.  The carefully placed cut out and luxurious fabric show off her enviable figure.  The simple slim line belt really highlights that and we love the minimalist styling.  This makes us focus on the woman in front of us. We could see this dress being not only a workhorse item in your wardrobe that carries you from the boardroom to the bar for happy hour but a perfect date night outfit if you added a few sparkling baubles here and there.

'I'm curious if Charlotte's going to have curly hair,' she told the magazine, adding that the scrutiny on little Charlotte's locks will 'inevitably' match her own growing up. 'I should apologize to her now,' she added. Chelsea noted that seven-month-old Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, who was born on September 26, has now become the center of her and her husband's life 'in the most blessed sense'. She said: 'I now understand - this is something else that Marc and I talk about all the time - all of the enthusiastic, bombastically spectacular, wonderful things people say about their children, because we also feel and think all those things about Charlotte - that she is just the most remarkable little bubbly, perfect, chunky monkey creature ever.' What a difference a decade makes: Chelsea in 2004 (L) and 2014 (R) showing off the naturally changing state of her locks . Still springy: At only 13-years-old Chelsea had already tamed most of her frizz, but rocked a tightly curled look for most of the years of her father's presidency . Despite her glamorous look in this month's Elle fashion spread, Chelsea confessed that fashion is not her forte. The former White House resident spoke of her family's relationship with designer Oscar de la Renta, who passed away in October, saying he 'was always giving me fashion advice - often in the form of just telling me what to wear, because I don't have a fashion brain'. Although shying away from making a direct comment on her mother's run for president and her own potential return to the role of first daughter, Chelsea did comment at length on the need for women in politics and gender equality in the workplace. 'We've made real progress on legal protections for women, but in no way are women at parity to men in our country in the workplace,' she explained. 'And if we look in the political sphere, it is challenging to me that women comprising 20 percent of Congress is treated as a real success. Since when did 20 percent become the definition of equality? 'And so when you ask about the importance of having a woman president, absolutely it's important, for, yes, symbolic reasons—symbols are important; it is important who and what we choose to elevate, and to celebrate.'

"This is a difficult but necessary thing to say: Incidents of police-involved killings and assaults on unarmed African-Americans are unlikely to end soon. That's partly because police brutality is neither new nor reflective of a ""moment."" And it's also because we have not yet shown the resolve needed to end it. This is a reality we must face if we are going to reverse course from what has become a national crisis. The peaceful protests that were followed by outbreaks of violence in Baltimore this week have underscored the danger of ignoring the crisis -- as frustration and impatience with the status quo boils over. The violent response of police officers to unarmed African-Americans is a decades-long phenomenon that has too often been dismissed as ""race card"" politics and black grievance. But this year's spate of killings and assaults, from Ferguson, Missouri, to North Charleston, South Carolina, to most recently Baltimore, are part of a deadly continuum of conduct that has created a well of resentment and anger in the  African-American community. So what makes now different? The advent of cell phone cameras and social media has for the first time allowed average citizens to document police brutality routinely and to disseminate these images nationally. As a result, it is no longer possible for officials and commentators to downplay or deny the existence of police brutality against unarmed African-Americans as has happened in the past. To call this ugly and unrelenting wave of police violence against unarmed African-Americans a national crisis is not an exaggeration -- we are losing the confidence of a generation of young people who no longer believe in the legitimacy or credibility of our law enforcement and the justice system that underpins it. A true democracy draws its strength from the confidence of its citizens in the bedrock institutions. The loss of that confidence threatens the very foundation of our legal system. How do we face this crisis? First, we must recognize that there are no quick fixes. The culture of policing in cities such as New York and Baltimore has developed over decades. Policing is a job passed down through families in which law enforcement norms and narratives are shared around the dinner table as much as in the station house. To subvert that culture will require vigorous, targeted and consistent training. That training must include a focus on managing implicit bias, encounters with the mentally ill and how best to de-escalate encounters with members of the community, especially young people. Training must be accompanied by supervision and accountability for officers who fail to conform their behavior to training principles. President Barack Obama is right when he reminds us that policing, like education, is a function of state and local government. And it's true that his options are limited. And yet the federal government has proven to be quite adept at influencing education policy in states and cities. How? By conditioning federal funds on compliance with federal standards. In contrast, while the Department of Justice provides more than $1 billion annually in grants to police departments across the country, those funds are provided free from obligations that awardees adopt federal standards on training, data collection or other measures with an explicit anti-racial bias focus. That must change. Also, the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department must be properly funded to investigate any police departments suspected of engaging in a pattern and practice of discrimination. Such investigations doubled to more than 20 under Attorney General Eric Holder, but given the nearly 30,000 police departments spread across the country, this is woefully inadequate. It's been reported that nearly every investigation conducted by the department has resulted in a finding of a pattern and practice of discrimination. The results in places such as Seattle and Cincinnati, where the departments worked with local officials to negotiate changes to local police practices, are promising. But the $12 million currently allocated to these investigations nationwide is a shameful pittance. Much has been made of rogue police officers, ""bad apples"" and other aberrant actors in the criminal justice system. They undoubtedly exist. But the failure of local law enforcement leadership to vigorously and aggressively discipline, punish and, where appropriate, remove those officers from police forces around the country has allowed the bad apples to spoil the whole bunch. There must be zero tolerance for racism, brutality and corruption in police departments. Making this change will require law enforcement to value the integrity of the badge over the unquestioning solidarity that has too often resulted in the protection of officers who have committed egregious acts. Yet until police officers come to expect swift and certain punishment for violating their oath to protect and serve, we are unlikely to see a real decrease in incidents of racially motivated police brutality. Ultimately, the crisis we face presents an opportunity to rethink policing in this country fundamentally, including who we decide to recruit to serve. Former Baltimore Police Commissioner Leonard Hamm, for example, has told me he was always skeptical of new police recruits who expressed a desire to become narcotics or homicide detectives. That thinking reflects a spirit of adventure, he told me, rather than a spirit of service. Hamm is right -- policing is, at its core, a service profession. Those we select for this difficult and dangerous job should not only demonstrate mental toughness, courage and smarts, but also integrity, maturity, empathy and a commitment to the communities they serve. A national crisis requires a national response, and that means that federal, state and local law enforcement leaders and organizations must honestly and aggressively move to end police brutality. Until we see that kind of wholesale engagement, the lives of innocent people -- and the integrity of our legal system -- hangs in the balance."
"Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Bishop Robert Finn, who remained on the job for years after becoming the highest-ranking U.S. Catholic official convicted in connection with the church's long-running sex abuse scandal, the Vatican announced Tuesday. Finn, who led the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Missouri, was found guilty in 2012 of failure to report suspected child abuse. The case was tried by a judge instead of by jury because prosecutors wanted to protect the young victims' anonymity. Finn was convicted of one count but not a misdemeanor charge he'd also faced. He was put on two years' probation but was not forced to spend time in jail or pay a fine, according to the Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney's Office. Two charges against his diocese were dropped. At the time of his conviction, Finn said, according to CNN affiliate KCTV: ""I truly regret and am sorry for the hurt these events have caused."" Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said the conviction and penalty, which included starting a $10,000 fund for sexual abuse counseling and mandatory training for church officials on how to report abuse, would have positive ramifications. ""We can be assured now that if an allegation of child abuse comes to the attention of the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, there will be no hesitation to report it immediately to the proper authorities,"" Baker said. The case against Finn revolved around his diocese's dealings with Shawn Ratigan, an Independence, Missouri, priest who pleaded guilty in August 2012 to five child pornography charges. Church officials found disturbing images on Ratigan's computer but didn't notify police until nearly five months later, prosecutors said. In those interceding months, the priest kept on working. And Finn kept his job as bishop, even after his 2012 conviction. The official website of the Catholic diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph still listed him as its bishop Tuesday morning. Cardinal Sean O'Malley, who took over the abuse-shaken Boston archdiocese and has become one of the Pope's point men in the United States, has acknowledged the inconsistency that someone who wouldn't be allowed to teach Sunday school was still running an American diocese. ""It's a question that the Holy See needs to address urgently,"" O'Malley said in a ""60 Minutes"" interview in November. ""There's a recognition of that ... from Pope Francis."" Candida Moss -- a professor at Notre Dame, a Catholic university in Indiana -- said it ""doesn't look very urgent"" that a decision came down only now, nearly three years after the conviction and five months after O'Malley's comments. Several factors may have played a role in the delay, including views from lawyers or power players at the Vatican, who may be reluctant to cast blame at high-level officials who don't report allegations quickly enough to government authorities. But the timing of the announcement may make sense given that it comes weeks after Francis came under fire for the installation of a new bishop in Chile, Juan Barros, despite protesters' claims he was complicit in sexual abuse cases there. ""It kind of shook Francis' reputation,"" said Moss. ""Having this resignation and putting right one of the more visible injustices on this, especially in the U.S., I think this is a typical Francis way to reinstall confidence."" Now that the case has been addressed, the Kansas City-St. Joseph diocese has a new leader: Kansas Archbishop Joseph Naumann. Under the Pope's directive, Naumann will be the Kansas City diocese's apostolic administrator, in addition to his regular responsibilities in Kansas, until a permanent bishop is appointed, according to an announcement on the diocese's website. ""I pray that the coming weeks and months will be a time of grace and healing for the Diocese,"" Naumann said in an open letter to parishioners. ""All of us, who are privileged to serve in leadership for the Church, do so for only a season. It is not our Church, but Christ's Church."" Moss, the Notre Dame professor, predicted that the shuffling at the western Missouri diocese will be ""very well received,"" though some may question why it took so long. ""It's not just that it's late,"" Moss said, ""but it's that Francis could have been more explicit."" To that point, the co-director of BishopAccountability.org asked for more elaboration than the Vatican's one-line announcement that Francis accepted the resignation ""in accordance with ... Canon Law."" Anne Doyle, from the watchdog group that documents the Catholic church's abuse crisis, called Finn's removal ""a good step but just the beginning."" ""The pope must show that this decision represents a meaningful shift in papal practice -- that it signals a new era in bishop accountability,"" Doyle said. ""... What no pope has done to date is publicly confirm that he removed a culpable bishop because of his failure to make children's safety his first priority. We urge Pope Francis to issue such a statement immediately."" CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report."
"A woman suspected of abandoning her newborn baby girl in a South Carolina dumpster has come forward following the rescue of the hours old infant by a teenager. Horry County Police said the mother, who will be identified once she is formally charged, turned herself in on Thursday night after seeing herself on television in pictures released by the police. The baby girl was discovered struggling to breathe while trapped inside of a tied plastic bag by Austin Detray on Thursday afternoon when he heard her crying. Inside he also found the umbilical cord and placenta, according to WMBF. The 8lb 6oz newborn was taken to hospital where she is listed in stable condition, and the woman is currently in hospital and will be charged once she is released, police said. Scroll down for video . Horry County Police said the mother of an abandoned baby girl turned herself in on Thursday night (above a picture released by police of the woman suspected to be in connection to the incident) The woman is currently in hospital and will be charged once she is released, police said . The hours old baby girl was found trapped in a tied plastic bag inside a dumpster (pictured above) located in an apartment complex in Myrtle Beach . 'Hospital staff estimated the baby was only hours old,' Horry County Police Department Lt. Raul Denis told NBC. On Friday, he said the baby is healthy and is in the custody of the social services department. Police responded to a report of the incident around 2.30pm on Thursday at an apartment complex in Myrtle Beach near Island Green Country Club. Austin and his brother were taking trash to the dumpster when they heard a faint noise. 'I heard it and I instantly knew it was a baby and she was crying, so I jumped in the garbage can, or the dumpster, and I started moving bags away,' Austin told WMBF. 'I got two or three bags down and saw the baby's face pressed against the bag.' He added: 'It was tied shut…it was, it was horrible. I ripped it open and the umbilical cord was still there, the placenta, it was just born.' Austin Detray (above) was with his brother when they heard the infant crying from inside the dumpster and rescued her before calling for help . Austin's mother Jessica (right) cleared the baby girl's mouth and nasal passages to help her breathe . Emergency responders took the infant to hospital where she is listed in stable condition (above scenes from the incident) Austin then told his brother to go upstairs and get help when their mother, Jessica, came to the scene and cleared the baby's mouth and nasal passages. 'So what I did was I got towels and took care of her,' said the mother-of-five. 'I named her Hope. Because I have hope for her and I pray, and if anything comes from this I want to make sure she is okay.' Once on the scene, emergency responders took the infant to a nearby hospital. On Thursday, the Detrays went to visit the baby girl, and Jessica mentioned she is willing to care for the infant and is considering adoption. 'To the parents, you ought to be ashamed of yourself,' Jessica told WTHR. 'I'm sorry, but there are hospitals and door-knocking you could have done to make sure that baby was safe.'"
"The time is around 9pm on a Thursday and 7,000 people are chanting ‘YES! YES! YES!’ in a pitch-black car park in London’s Docklands. It’s been raining and the ground is damp, but we are all in our bare feet, which are going numb on the cold, hard concrete. Undeterred, we keep going. There’s a drum pounding in the distance and we keep step with its beat. Marianne Power attended Robbins’ Unleash The Power Within seminarwhich claims to ‘discover how to identify what it is you really want' The mood is tribal. I feel as if we’re on our way to a ritual killing. Maybe our own. We’ve already signed waivers warning us that what we are about to take part in could result in ‘physical or emotional injury, paralysis, death . . .’ and we’ve spent the past half-an-hour being told what we need to do to avoid hospitalisation. I feel sick with anticipation, but there’s no way out — the huge crowd keeps pushing me forward. Then, the chanting stops and a hush fills the air. We are faced with our fate. It glimmers grey and red in the darkness: lanes of burning hot coals, which we are to walk over. Yes, actually walk over — with our bare feet. We have spent the past two hours preparing for this moment — being whipped into something called ‘peak state’, a place where you are so mentally strong that you can do anything. The idea is that, once you overcome the fear of walking on coals of between 1,200 and 2,000 Fahrenheit, you can ‘conquer the other fires of your life with ease’. But I don’t conquer anything with ease. It’s not in my nature. ‘Am I really doing this?’ is all I can think. But yes, I am. For the past year, I’ve been on a self-improvement mission. Fed up with a life spent worrying, single and broke, I’ve set myself a bizarre challenge to live by the rules of a different self-help guru each month. Marianne (pictured) has set herself a bizarre challenge to live by the rules of a different self-help guru each month and this month she chose that of Anthony Robbins . And, when it comes to the self-improvement world, Anthony Robbins is the king. Everyone from world leaders — Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton, Mikhail Gorbachev — to athletes such as Serena Williams and actors including Hugh Jackman seek his counsel. He even helped Princess Diana and Margaret Thatcher. His IS a classic rags-to-riches story. Determined to transcend his poor childhood, he became obsessed with self-improvement. He’d listen to motivational tapes on his way to his job as a janitor, before going on to give motivational talks himself. Fast forward to today and he is a bestselling author and hugely successful business man, whose net worth is in the region of half a billion dollars. He charges $1 million to coach private clients — which is why the rest of us have to settle for listening to him in a concert hall. Anthony Robbins (pictured in the 1990s) charges $1 million to coach private clients and is the 'king' of the self-improvement world . According to his website, Robbins’ Unleash The Power Within seminar would help me ‘discover how to identify what it is you really want, break through any barriers that might be holding you back, increase your energy and mental clarity, and infuse passion into your life’. Big promises. But the fortysomething woman next to me in the queue to get in promises that he can deliver. She has been three times before, she tells me. ‘When you walk over those coals, something changes,’ she says, her eyes wide. ‘I can’t explain it, but it’s just amazing.’ She has all the fervour of a fanatic. Two physiotherapists from Windsor join in our conversation — they’ve been sent here by their boss. ‘He went last year and got a lot out of it,’ they say. ‘He was on a high for weeks.’ And ‘high’ is the perfect word for the atmosphere. As we file into the arena, there’s chaos as people rush to get good seats — but no one sits in them. They’re too busy dancing along with the music blasting from the speakers. It’s like being at a One Direction concert. After half-an-hour, Tony walks on stage and the screaming goes off the scale. People can hardly contain themselves in the presence of the 6 ft 7 in mountain of a man. With his Hollywood tan, white teeth and lantern jaw, he looks like something that a Mills & Boon writer would dream up. And just to add to the effect, his chiselled face is blown up to God-like proportions on massive screens behind him. It takes minutes for the applause to die down enough for him to speak — but when he starts, he doesn’t stop. His basic message is that anything is possible if we just get our minds and bodies into what he calls the peak state. He says we are all defined by our limiting beliefs and that if we get rid of these then ‘the impossible just gets done’. He is the King of the Catchphrase: ‘It’s impossible to love yourself when you’re not being yourself’; ‘Change your story, change your life . . .’ These nuggets come out of his mouth from 1pm to 9pm. He doesn’t take a tea break and neither do we. It’s extraordinary — I’ve never seen anything like it. Just the sheer energy of him. I find myself thinking that he is the living embodiment of human potential, then I realise I’m swooning. Even world leaders like Nelson Mandela (left) and Bill Clinton (right) have sought the advice and counsel of Anthony Robbins . I turn to the Norwegian man next to me and say: ‘I think I’m in love . . .’ He smiles and says: ‘Me, too.’ We are all under his spell and will do anything he says, including hugging and high-fiving strangers, and punching our fists in the air while yelling: ‘Yes, yes, yes!’ It’s just so un-English. There are moments when I look around at the collective madness and feel as if I’ve become part of a cult, but I have to make a decision: get embarrassed or go with it. I go with it. As the day goes on, we examine our ‘limiting beliefs’. I identify mine as being bad with money and always getting sick. And then he asks us to visualise what life would be like if we got rid of these limiting beliefs. I imagine being healthy, energetic and productive, someone who just gets things done without always worrying about the things that can go wrong. I imagine my bank account being in the black and owning a property. To build on this vision, we’re taught how to get into a peak state by thinking of the best moment of our lives, the moment we felt strongest and most at peace. I think of times with loved ones and professional achievements that I’m proud of. Each time we do we are told to ‘make a move’, so every time we make that move in the future, these memories will come back. I pump my fist in the air, again and again and again. I can’t believe I’m doing it — it’s so not me. I feel as if I’m in the film Rocky. And then the time comes to walk on fire. We’re told to take off our shoes and socks and march out of the conference centre to the 8 ft lines of coal in the car park. Robbins is said to have also helped well-known face including Princess Diana (left) and former prime minister, Margaret Thatcher (right) A part of me wants to run away, but a bigger part of me knows that I can do this. Then I’m standing in front of the coals and two men are instructing me to shout: ‘YES!’ I do. They say ‘Make your move!’ and I pump my fist in the air. Then, I go for it. I put my foot on the coals and after that I remember nothing — until my last step, when I could feel heat. I have half-a-second of panic when I realise what I’m doing — but, by then, my feet are on the cold square of grass put at the end of the fire and my feet are being hosed down by helpers. It’s done. I’ve walked across a bed of hot coals. Two weeks later, I still cannot answer those questions, but I find myself having the same thoughts as the woman I met in the queue at the start of that day. That strange moment of collective hysteria, when we walked over hot coals, has changed something within me. If I can walk on fire without barbecuing my feet, what else can I do? I’m very keen to find out. To follow Marianne’s self-help journey, go to helpmeblog.net ."

"Karlovic, 35, served 21 aces as the world number one struggled to control his ground strokes in high winds.
In the semi-finals, Karlovic will face Spain's David Ferrer, who overcame Germany's Dustin Brown 6-2 6-2.
Third seed Tomas Berdych from the Czech Republic will face Italy's Andreas Seppi in the other semi.
Berdych saw off France's Richard Gasquet 6-2 6-1, while Seppi enjoyed a 7-5 6-4 victory over Ivan Dodig of Croatia.
But the day belonged to world ranked 27 Karlovic, who recorded his second career win over the Serb having also triumphed at the Madrid Masters in 2008.
Djokovic was nevertheless twice within two points of winning the match in the second set tie-breaker, before dropping serve in the seventh game of the final set.
Karlovic said: ""I was feeling good despite the wind. I know he wasn't able to show his full range.
""I was relaxed and didn't feel I had to do anything extraordinary. I just had to focus on my game."""
"A dog left in critical condition after being repeatedly stabbed in a violent attack, is on the road to recovery. The sandy-colored canine was found sprawled in a pool of his own blood on a rural road in Cass County, North Dakota. The animal, who has been named Wilford by his rescuers, needed more than 50 stitches after being set upon with an eight inch blade. Wilford has been nursed back to health by a foster family and is now slowly returning to his paws. Survivor: Wilford is on the road to recovery after being found stabbed in Cass County, North Dakota . He doesn't seem traumatized,' foster mother Ellen Brisch, from 4 Luv Of Dog Rescue, reportedly told Valley News Live. 'He loves people and he's very happy with us.' In the days after the attack Ellen, from the non profit organisation, focused on making sure Wilford got lots of rest and took his medication. Two weeks on, she told how she is now noticing the spring return to the dog's step. 'Giving them another chance is really important,' Brisch told the website. When Wilford was found, authorities said he had no collar, tags or micro-chip. The Cass County Sherriff's Office has launched an investigation into the horrific attack and appealed for help in catching those responsible. 'He is such a nice-spirited dog, so we want to figure out what happened,' Deputy Jolene Fletcher reportedly told The Republic. Recovery: Wilford needed more than 50 stitches after he was found in a critical condition ."
"The Australian singer, 48, and English actor Joshua Sasse, 28, announced their engagement earlier this year.
The couple have been vocal supporters of the ""Say I Do Down Under"" marriage equality campaign.

Mr Sasse, who helped launch the ""yes"" campaign at the weekend, said the pair would like a wedding in Melbourne, ""but we will not get married until this law has passed in Australia"".
""When I found out that gay marriage was illegal in Australia, I was astounded,"" he told Australia's Seven Network.
""I simply can't fathom on any level, whether it's moral or religious or anything, that I have the right to get married and to marry the person that I love and that somebody else doesn't because of their sexual orientation."""
"The Japanese firm expects net profit in the year to March of 1.7 trillion yen ($15.1bn; Â£12.1bn), compared with a previous forecast of 1.55 trillion yen.
That is despite losing its top-selling carmaker status to Volkswagen in 2016,
Meanwhile, Toyota said it had begun formal talks to work with Suzuki on projects including safety technology.
Analysts said the partnership - which could also involve collaboration on vehicles that were less damaging to the environment - would give Suzuki access to Toyota's technology. Benefits for Toyota are likely to include tapping in to Suzuki's strong market position in India.
The forecast for 2016-17 profits is still below the 2.1 trillion yen profit it recorded a year earlier.
But with Japan's yen weakening against the dollar, it will benefit from sales overseas which are worth more when converted back into the local currency.
Like other Japanese carmakers, Toyota is watching closely for any trade tariffs introduced by the new US administration.
At the moment, only about half of the cars it sells in the country are manufactured locally. Last month, US President Donald Trump criticised it for making vehicles in Mexico to sell over the border.
The US is its biggest market, and it is struggling to meet demand for bigger vehicles such as sport utility vehicles. Lower petrol prices have made such models more affordable to drive."
"Father-of-two: Paul Doyle, 56, has been jailed after being unmasked as the head of drugs ring . A gangster who lived a life of luxury in a mansion near Premier League footballers has been jailed for 16 years after being unmasked as the head of a drugs ring. Father-of-two Paul Doyle, 56, moved his family into an £820,000 home in Altrincham, Cheshire, despite having never worked and living life ‘on tick’ and incapacity handouts. Doyle - described as a ‘well-known and colourful character’ in his native Salford - put down a £200,000 deposit and obtained a £600,000 mortgage by falsely claiming his wife Jeanette, 49, worked as a company executive. But his family were probed after scandalising the leafy neighbourhood in Altrincham where his teenage son regularly rode quad bikes around the streets and later received an Asbo for terrorising other local children who complained of being robbed and beaten up. Police kept watch on the family’s home where Doyle chopped down the huge front hedge so he could check for unwanted visitors outside. He was eventually arrested during a raid on his five-bedroom house after a major investigation into the supply of various drugs in the North of England, which culminated in the seizure of £15million of cocaine and a haul of heroin. The family have since lost the property and Mrs Doyle is now living in a council house in Salford. Doyle admitted supplying class A and B drugs, between 2012 and 2014, plus money laundering and benefit fraud offences at Manchester Crown Court. He now faces a proceeds of crime hearing. Going in: Police are seen raiding Doyle's £820,000 five-bedroom home in Altrincham, Cheshire, in July 2014 . Luxurious life: Doyle put down a £200,000 deposit and obtained a £600,000 mortgage on the property (above) by falsely claiming his wife Jeanette, 49, worked as a company executive . The court heard Doyle had bought the house as his ‘dream family home’ in 2004 after being freed from a seven-year jail term for cocaine and cannabis dealing plus assault. He was claiming tax credits and other handouts, saying two heart attacks made him unable to work. But he fraudulently claimed Mrs Doyle earned £197,000 a year as a ‘project executive’ for a lettings firm and she was given a mortgage of £616,000. Monthly mortgage repayments were about £3,000 but the accounts were consistently in arrears. And in June 2006 Doyle took out loans totalling £83,000 with finance companies by making similar false representations about Mrs Doyle’s income - and even acquired a new BMW vehicle. Despite the late mortgage payments Doyle paid £450,000 into his and his wife’s bank accounts over a six-year period between 2006 and 2012. On average monthly deposits of £5,778 were made totalling around £77,000 per year. Police began secretly filming Doyle and started to track his car. It emerged he helped finance a cocaine deal in which drugs were brought into the country by couriers who travelled to the UK from France on fishing boats. Entering: The family have since lost the property and Mrs Doyle is now living in a council house in Salford . Going in: Doyle's family were probed after scandalising the leafy neighbourhood where his teenage son regularly rode quad bikes around the streets and later received an Asbo for terrorising other local children . Up to 4.2lbs (1.9kg) of heroin and 170lbs (77kg) of cocaine landed in the UK - but police began arresting Doyle’s accomplices, and he got directly involved in deals himself. He organised a collection of 2.2lbs (1kg) of heroin in Wigan, and then started running a wholesale supply line in cannabis, involving up to 88lbs (40kg), and amphethamines, amounting to around  44lbs (20kg), to crime families in Barrow-in-Furness and Carlisle in Cumbria. He was eventually caught in May last year with 6.6lbs (3kg) of amphetamines in Salford. Whilst in jail on remand police decoded conversations in which Doyle chatted about drugs - one in which he talked about how a friend ‘wanted his hoover back’ - linking him to a Cumbrian heroin dealer who hid just an ounce of the drug inside his Henry vacuum cleaner. Suspicion: Despite the late mortgage payments Doyle paid £450,000 into his and his wife’s bank accounts over a six-year period between 2006 and 2012 . Home: Doyle was claiming tax credits and other handouts, saying two heart attacks made him unable to work . Other recorded conversations heard Doyle use the codeword ‘downstairs’ for heroin, which police were able to work out because of the timing and context of the conversations. Altrincham, a market town near Manchester Airport, is the location of four of the ten most expensive streets in the North West. The top-priced road has an average property value of £2.5million. Manchester City stars James Milner and Joe Hart live in the Altrincham area, in homes worth £3.3million and £2.9million respectively, and Ireland assistant boss Roy Keane is said to have a house there. The local residents also include ex-England international Emily Heskey, who now plays for Bolton Wanderers in the Championship and lives in a £3million six-bedroom house with his wife Chantelle. The Hale area of Altrincham was reported to be home to at least 33 Premier League footballers as of 2010 - including Liverpool, Everton and Manchester United players. Ian McMeekin, defending, said the case was the ‘decline and fall of a drug dealer’. He said Doyle once had a building supply business and when buildings were demolished he would broker on the stolen brick. He added: ‘He is a well known local, born and raised in Salford. He is well known as a colourful character.’ He added that he also undertook protection work in West Africa and China where he was working legitimately but while not paying income tax. He said he was also provided with income from dog breeding. Mr McMeekin said: ‘He didn’t involve his wife through pressure or influence. He operated alone and in ignorance. His wife’s salary was ridiculously high, ought to make anyone question the legitimacy of the application. ‘The defendant has nothing left apart from his family - the house has gone. His ruin is complete and he must accept the whole responsibility for it.’ Sentencing, Judge Richard Mansell QC told Doyle he had ‘barefaced gall’ to claim benefits and added: ‘I’m quite satisfied that you played a lead role in all of your offences. ‘You had close links to the original sources of the drugs and you directed and organised the sale of drugs on a commercial scale. You plainly did make a lot of money from these enterprises - where it has gone is another matter.’ He described Doyle as ‘the head of an organised criminal gang’, who continued to orchestrate the business from behind bars because he had ‘loyal servants working on the outside’."
"Bendtner required oxygen as he was carried off the field on a stretcher, having landed awkwardly in a collision with Blues defender Michael Morrison.
The Dane had set up Eric Lichaj to open the scoring and Apostolos Vellios made it 2-0 from Henri Lansbury's cross.
Lukas Jutkiewicz headed a goal back for Blues but Hildeberto Pereira finished Ben Osborn's low pass to seal victory.
A Birmingham win could have taken Gary Rowett's side as high as second in the table, but their first away loss of the league campaign means they may be outside the top six by the time they host Rotherham on Tuesday.
Lichaj's powerful angled shot, the defender's first goal for almost a year, lit up a flat first half at the City Ground.
The only other talking point before the interval was Lansbury's disallowed free-kick, with referee Jeremy Simpson initially awarding a goal and then reversing his decision following consultation with his assistant.
Forest's win came hours after owner Fawaz Al Hasawi announced he is close to agreeing a deal to sell the club.
Al Hasawi, who took control of Forest in 2012, would not reveal the identity of the buyers but BBC Sport understands that a United States consortium, led by millionaire John Jay Moores, is on the verge of securing a £50m deal.
Head coach Philippe Montanier told BBC Radio Nottingham: ""I enjoyed the victory. We've worked hard during the international break and we applied what we worked on during that period.
""Bendtner's injury is a bad point of this evening. We don't know how serious it is. I hope it is not very serious.
""When you go off on a stretcher, you always worry. We hope to have more news on Saturday.""
Birmingham manager Gary Rowett told BBC WM: ""We weren't anywhere near the standards we've set so far this season, certainly in the first half. We were a little bit too predictable.
""We wanted to do much better in the second half and there was a real determination to do that. We ended up at 2-1 and we looked as though we had put them under some real pressure.
""I wasn't overly happy with one or two decisions, but I thought Forest deserved it. They showed more energy and desire.""

"Disgraced NBC anchor Brian Williams has threatened to make his departure from the channel 'really ugly', it has been reported. The 55-year-old newsman is refusing to go down 'without a fight' as he looks to return to his post on NBC Nightly News, according to a source close to the network. It comes after it was revealed that an internal inquiry found Williams's had lied in his reporting to make himself look good at least 11 times. Disgraced NBC anchor Brian Williams (pictured) has threatened to make his departure from the channel 'really ugly', it has been reported . He was suspended in February with no pay for six months after it emerged that he repeatedly told a false story about being aboard a military helicopter hit by an RPG over Iraq. A source said to be close to NBC has told The New York Post how Williams 'is saying he’s not going down without a fight and (is) threatening to make it really ugly'. Williams is currently halfway through his six-month suspension from his roles as anchor and managing editor of the Nightly News. He was replaced by Lester Holt, who has kept ratings relatively steady. It is unclear whether NBC will put Williams back in the top slot when the suspension ends. Iraq shame: Williams fell from grace after veterans called him out after he lied about being on board a US military chopper which was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade . Yesterday it was reported that NBC News chief Andrew Lack wanted Williams to resume his role. But this contradicted earlier claims that NBC executives wanted Williams out and were trying to negotiate his resignation. A source told the New York Daily News 'Andy (Lack) believes viewers want him (Williams) back. 'The feeling is that (Williams') problem seems to be more with the media and other reporters than his viewers - if Andy can figure out a way to get him back on the air he will do it.' The source added that Lack 'will not make a decision about Williams' fate until the network's internal probe is complete.' On Tuesday, a report emerged in the Hollywood Reporter that Lack was in fact not convinced that Williams would be able to return. Williams has reportedly been banned from speaking publicly about the investigation, or defending himself against any new claims. He is reported to have signed a deal with the network last year to continue at the network thought to be worth $10million a year. According to the New York Post, NBC News has yet to make any decision's about the newsman's future."
"They include schemes to revamp Newport and Bridgend centres, move people back into empty homes in Port Talbot and make properties in Pontypridd energy efficient.
Vacant flats above shops in Swansea will also be converted into homes and derelict sites in Merthyr Tydfil will be built on.
Schemes totalling £36m for north Wales were announced by ministers last week.
The funding is from the Welsh government's Vibrant and Viable Places initiative.
Housing and Regeneration Minister Carl Sargeant said he was ""delighted"" with the range of projects being supported.
""There are several excellent projects targeted at renovating empty properties, derelict buildings and empty shops, attracting more people to live in town centres and making the necessary improvements to existing housing stock,"" he said.
""I've also approved significant funding for a wide range of different projects, from a state of the art business facility in Pontypridd to an integrated transport hub in Port Talbot.
""Facilities like these, in conjunction with the new homes, will create jobs, improve links and breathe new life into town centre centres."""

Playing his first Test for 18 months, Pattinson ran through the fragile Windies top order to secure his fourth five-wicket haul in Test cricket.
Kraigg Brathwaite was the only visiting batsman to show any resistance at the Bellerive Oval with a patient 94.
Australia take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series, and could return to the top of the ICC Test rankings if they complete a 3-0 series win with victories in Melbourne and Sydney.
Australia captain Steve Smith chose to enforce the follow-on after Josh Hazelwood and Peter Siddle took just five overs to take the West Indies' remaining three first-innings wickets.
There was time for Darren Bravo, 94 not out overnight, to complete his seventh Test century as West Indies posted a first-innings total of 223 in response to Australia's 583-4 declared.
Australia skipper Smith has ""no doubt"" he will be fit for the second Test in Melbourne starting on 26 December despite suffering discomfort in his knee and hip at Hobart.
Smith will sit out his Big Bash League side Sydney Sixers' domestic fixtures against Sydney Thunder and Hobart Hurricanes after aggravating an injury in his right knee and straining his right hip.
Usman Khawaja could return to the squad after missing the last two Tests with a hamstring injury, but coach Darren Lehmann wants the Sydney Thunder batsman to prove his fitness in the Big Bash first.
""Usman's first got to be fit - if he's not fit he won't play, there's no doubt about that,"" Lehmann said.
West Indies fast bowler Shannon Gabriel will return home after suffering an ankle injury in the first Test defeat.
Gabriel could not bat in either innings after suffering a stress-related injury to his left ankle late on the opening day on Thursday.
The West Indies have lost seven of their nine Test matches this year, with a win and a draw against England the only positives for Caribbean cricket in 2015.
Amid the loom, Windies legend Brian Lara has suggested that could be tempted by a role on the West Indies coaching team.
Lara, 46, who has been playing festival cricket in Western Australia this week, told former Australia spinner Shane Warne on Twitter that he would be willing to help out coach Phil Simmons and his team.
Lara scored 11,953 Test runs in 131 Tests for the West Indies between 1990 and 2006."

Britain's Froome has won the race twice before - in 2013 and 2015 - both times going on to win the Tour de France.
He decided to go out early in the race against the clock because he was concerned it might rain later in the race.
""It was tough. I was running out of legs,"" he said before Contador and Porte had finished.

"The caves have been digitally reproduced as part of the city's first Festival of Caves.
The tour will take in Mortimer's Hole under Nottingham Castle and King David's Dungeon - caves some people would not be able to access.
The city has more than 500 man-made sandstone caves which have been used for dwellings and jail cells.
Nottingham City councillor, Dave Trimble, said: ""There are plenty of local people who don't know about the hidden world beneath their feet.""
He said the new virtual reality tour would allow visitors who were unable to descend the steep steps into the caves to experience them.
Andrew Whitney of Hot Knife Digital Media, which developed the tour, said: ""We've taken very accurate data to digitally reproduce the caves in a gaming environment.
""We're excited to bring the caves into the 21st Century using the latest gaming and virtual reality technology, increasing the accessibility of these sites to everyone.""
A series of caves has been found in the past six years due to funded projects such the Nottingham Caves Survey, which mapped and laser-scanned many of them.
The festival runs until 23 October."
"The UK's chief veterinary officer said H5N8 avian flu has been discovered at a farm with 1,000 birds in Wyre.
Graeme Cooke said it has a ""business link"" to nearby farm Hy-Fly Game Hatcheries Limited in Preesall where the infection was confirmed on Tuesday.
Public Health England (PHE) said the risk to humans was ""very low"".
A 1.8 mile (3km) protection zone has been set up around the farm.
Defra said: ""This case was proactively identified as part of a routine investigation of premises traced as a result of confirmation of the disease in Lancashire earlier this week.
""There is a business link between the two premises.""
It said a number of birds have died with the remaining birds at the premises to be culled.
Defra said a full investigation is under way to determine the source of the infection.
Other related premises have been placed under restrictions which will remain in place until all investigations are complete.
The Food Standards Agency said bird flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers.
There have been a number of other outbreaks of the virus including on a farm with 19,500 turkeys in Boston on Friday which was the third case of the H5N8 strain of avian flu in Lincolnshire in about four weeks.
The same strain has been discovered in birds in Settle, North Yorkshire, a swannery in Dorset and flocks in Carmarthenshire, south west Wales.
In December, the government introduced an avian influenza prevention zone, which lasts until 28 February, to help protect poultry and captive birds from avian flu after the strain was found in 14 European countries including Germany and France."

The number of Weibo users fell after China's censors strengthened control of online discussions last year.
The China Internet Network Information Center said in its annual report that almost 28 million people abandoned Weibo in 2013.
The sale is a big test of demand for Chinese internet stocks ahead of an anticipated listing by Weibo's co-owner, the Alibaba group.
China's internet market has grown to become the world's biggest with more than 500 million users.
With major global social networking firms such as Facebook and Twitter blocked in the country, domestic companies have benefited the most from this growth.
However, the growing popularity of social media platforms has also attracted the attention of authorities who have moved swiftly to silence voices online."
"Concerns are growing over Russian ships that have docked in a once-secret  naval base in the Arctic. Military leaders in Norway are nervous about its powerful neighbour's presence on its 'strategically important' coastline following a spike in tensions between Russia and NATO nations. Some experts have criticised the shutting down of Olavsvern Naval Base - a huge complex buried in mountainous terrain near the town of Tromsoe - which has been closed since 2009. But fears have once again peaked after three Russian ships spent the entire winter docked deep within the mountain hideaway which was once a heavily guarded military facility. Show of strength: Norway's military leaders are growing concerned after three Russian warships spent the winter docked inside a closed naval base (file photo) deep inside the country's mountainous terrain . Aggression: In February, RAF planes intercepted two Russian bombers (file photo) which had flown into Irish territory and forced a passenger jet to divert its course . Force: And late last year, the Russian navy anti-submarine ship Severomorsk (file photo) and three other Russian ships had to be escorted out of the British channel . It was originally shut because the country's leaders thought the threat from Moscow was reduced, despite its massive Northern Fleet which is base in the nearby Kola Peninsula. Norway's former vice admiral said shutting down the base was 'pure madness' while other critics say their submarines now have to travel hundreds of extra miles to protect the region. This is far from the first time Russia has flexed its military muscles in other countries' territory. In February, a passenger plane had to be diverted to avoid two Russian bombers that flew through Irish-controlled airspace without warning. The disruption on February 18 was thought to have occurred during the same incident in which British RAF Typhoon fighters were scrambled to escort the Russian vessels. That move was perceived as a show of strength by Russian President Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine conflict after Prime Minister David Cameron accused him of challenging the 'territorial integrity' of Kiev. It followed a separate incident when the Royal Navy had to intercept a Russian warship which strayed to close to the UK while passing through the English channel the same month. The Neustrashimy-class warship – equipped with missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes – was monitored and escorted by a heavily-armed British frigate. Cat and mouse: Heavily-armed HMS Argyll follows the Russian warship (back left) as it passes through the English Channel in February . Intercepted: Footage released on Russian TV showed the moment two RAF jets escorted the Russian bomber in February . Concerned: They are worried by this perceived show of strength from Moscow (Russian President Vladimir Putin pictured) and its presence on its 'strategically important' coastline . And late last year, the HMS Tyne had to escort another Russian destroyer and three other boats from the Channel as they passed through the Strait of Dover after carrying out military exercises in the North Sea. Since January 2014, there have been at least 17 shows of military strength by Russia near the UK. The most serious included: . Feb 18: RAF jets scrambled after two Russian Bear bombers spotted off the coast of Cornwall, forcing a flight from Dublin to divert. Feb 15: Russian warship intercepted by Royal Navy in the English Channel. Jan 28: RAF fighters challenge two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles south of Bournemouth. Jan 8: Defence chiefs ask for US help to hunt a suspected Russian submarine lurking off the coast of Scotland. Nov 2014: Russian flotilla on military exercise in the Channel escorted from UK waters by HMS Tyne. Nov 2014: Nato aircraft called in to hunt suspected Russian submarine off the west coast of Scotland. Oct 2014: RAF Typhoon warplanes shadow two Bears as they fly down the west coast of Britain. Elinar Skorgen added: 'We are the only country along with Russia to have a permanent presence in the Barents Sea, where we share a common border. Obviously our navy should be stationed there, including our submarines. If the ships aren't there where they are needed, they might as well be scrapped altogether.' The Armed forces put the base - which cost over £390million to construct - up for sale on Norway's version of eBay. It was eventually bought for just £3.5million by a Norwegian businessmen and was rented out to Russian research vessels which were reportedly linked to the country's state-owned energy giant Gazprom. Its landlord Gunnar Wilhelmsen said: 'There are no longer any secrets surrounding this base... Not since the military and NATO agreed to put it on sale over the Internet, along with photographs of every nook and cranny.' Many military experts are now worried by the the potential for Russian military activity aboard the research vessels. A former second in command for the Norwegian military said: 'Russia is a country where the state has a say over all commercial or semi-state business. It's clear, very few people know what happens on these vessels.' Jan Reksten believes the sale of Olavsvern was 'a double loss' as 'Norway's armed forces lost an important base and now there are Russian vessels docked there'."
"Ever written yourself a note, stuffed it in your pocket and headed out into the world only to discover that, somewhere along your journey, the piece of paper has disappeared? If you live in the UK, there's a small chance that note has found its way into the hands of 23-year-old Daisy Bentley. For the past six years, the London-based artist has scoured the streets of cities and towns looking for those odd bits of paper that flutter to the ground when their owners aren't looking. Her quest has uncovered a fascinating, if idiosyncratic, collection of shopping lists, reminders, requests, love notes and motivational musings, all poignant pieces of others' lives. And now a gallery in London has put a selection on display for the public. ""I wasn't intending to start a collection,"" she told CNN. ""I always naturally collected things -- as many artists do -- and it got to the point that I was picking up every one I saw. Now I can barely walk down a street without picking up a scrap of paper."" Bentley began collecting them six years ago after a note caught her eye one rainy night on a walk in her home town of Norwich, England. It's something she confesses has been a lifelong love -- keepsakes ranging from her mother's cutlery to her own dead goldfish have ended up carefully preserved in her collection for posterity. The notes project, she says, is a culmination of keeping her eyes on the sidewalk and spotting the little things that most people wouldn't notice as they walked down the street. ""I get very odd looks from strangers,"" she admits, ""but since I've made friends and families aware of the project, they get very excited when I find one while out with them."" And while some dismiss such behavior as hoarding, Bentley feels it is part of human nature to hold on to items, no matter how small or insignificant they may seem. ""Humans want to collect and show to others,"" she says. ""They want to share and learn from the things they have found."" She says her collecting has led to interesting anthropological insights into the human condition. One of her favorite observations is the evolution of handwriting over the past few decades, from the beautiful copperplate penmanship of the '70s to modern teen girl love notes with hearts dotting i's and multiple exclamation marks. More recently, the note collection has led to an exhibition at Stour Space gallery in London's Hackney Wick, where Bentley works as a shop and studio manager. It showcases a small part of her 1,500-strong collection. The decision to display the notes came in part from a desire to put them back into the public space. ""I always wanted to showcase them, to see what people's reactions were and if anyone would come forward,"" she said. So far two note owners -- one a colleague from the gallery and one an employee from a pub whose beer coasters she had found on her quest -- have revealed themselves as owners of notes. Bentley gave them framed prints as a thank you. And while some may find the notion of handwritten notes quaint, as social media and smartphones begin to replace handwriting, Bentley says she finds the note collection an interesting way for an artist to explore people's lives. ""Technology is useful, but sometimes the simplest ways are still the best,"" she said. ""I still usually draw a map rather than relying on technology to get to a place -- and many people are just the same."""
"This is the moment a heroic teenage Baskin Robbins employee in Washington punched an armed robber as he tried to steal money from the cash register. Rachael Bishop, 19, was working an afternoon shift at the ice cream chain's Lynnwood store when a man wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses came in, unzipped his jacket and showed her he had a gun. Bishop said she tried to plead with the man when he ordered her to hand over all the money in the cash register, but when that didn't work she took action. As the man reached into the till, Bishop tried to swat his hand away. When that didn't stop him, she started punching him in the head multiple times. Scroll down for video . This is the moment heroic teenage Baskin Robbins employee Rachael Bishop, 19,  punched an armed robber as he tried to steal money from the cash register of the Lynnwood, Washington store . As the man reached into the till Bishop tried to swat his hand away. When that didn't stop him, she started punching him in the head multiple times . Bishop said it was 'just a reaction', an instinct to protect the store. 'I love my bosses here, so a couple hundred bucks gets stolen, that's damage to the store and everyone's paycheck,' she said . 'I didn't want him to take my store's money, it was just a reaction,' Bishop told KIRO TV. 'It hurt, but you have adrenaline so you don't really think about it.' The robber punched Bishop right back, and that's when she said he managed to steal $280 from the cash register, according to Komo News. And yet the teenager remained unfazed. As the robber fled out the door she immediately ran after him. Bishop continued to chase the robber through the strip mall's parking lot, warning people nearby that he had a gun. Onlookers saw what Bishop was doing and began following the man as well. Bishop said she tried to plead with the man when he ordered her to hand over all the money in the cash register, but when that didn't work she took action . The robber punched Bishop right back, and that's when she said he managed to steal $280 from the cash register . The robber disappeared into the woods but, according to police, the combined efforts of Bishop and the public helped officers quickly locate and arrest the man. 'They did a really good job directing the police into a starting location where the suspect was last seen disappearing into a wooded area,' said Lynwood Police Commander Jim Nelson. Officers later discovered the 44-year-old man was a wanted felon for forgery. Both police and Bishop's boss recommend to just hand over the money when confronted with an armed robber, but Nelson said 'the reality is that people kind of react as they react'. 'In this case, she fought back and didn't want to be a victim of this crime.' Bishop said she realizes 'how stupid it was to punch someone with a gun', but said she was just acting on instinct to protect the store she has worked at for nearly a year, according to Q13 Fox. 'I love my bosses here, so a couple hundred bucks gets stolen, that's damage to the store and everyone's paycheck,' she said. Bishop even went back to work the same day of the robbery. 'My boss was like, you can go home, but I actually need my hours,' she said. 'I have to stay.' And yet the teenager remained unfazed. As the robber ran out the door she immediately ran after him, chasing the robber through a strip mall's parking lot, warning people nearby that he had a gun . Bishop even went back to work the same day of the robbery. 'My boss was, like, you can go home, but I actually need my hours,' she said. 'I have to stay'"
"Crews were called to a building site in Bloomery Circle, Llanwern, at 21:15 BST on Wednesday.
The blaze burned for more than 10 hours before it was extinguished.
It is understood the burning material included a large amount of scrapped railway sleepers.
A Gwent Police spokesman said: ""Officers are investigating the circumstances surrounding the fire... which is believed to have been deliberately set."""
"Chaos over Labour's plan to target wealthy foreigners has left even Ed Miliband's own family baffled. Mike Keen, the Labour leader's cousin, said he was 'officially confused' over whether or not the party was actually promising to scrap non-dom rules. Mr Miliband used a speech yesterday to say he would 'abolish' the 200-year-old rule for non-doms, but in January Ed Balls said it would cost the country money. Mike Keen, the Labour leader's cousin, said he was 'officially confused' over whether or not the Ed Miliband was actually promising to scrap non-dom rules . Mr Keen posted on his public Facebook page that he needed someone to explain to him just what the Labour policy was . Non-domicile status allows people living and working in Britain to only pay tax on their UK income, but not earnings from overseas. They must prove that they regard a foreign country as their real home. But Mr Miliband argues that non-dom tests 'are not very rigorous' and can be granted to people who have a burial plot or property abroad. Newspaper reports suggested that non-dom rules would be scrapped by Labour altogether. But  it emerged Labour would allow 'real temporary residents' to take advantage of the rules - with the time limit to be consulted on should they take power in the General Election on May 7. In a speech in Warwick yesterday, Mr Miliband said that everyone who has made Britain their permanent home should pay full UK tax on all their income and gains. 'It is not fair. It is not just. It holds Britain back. We will stop it. The next Labour government will abolish the non-dom rule,' he said. He was backed by Mr Balls, the shadow chancellor, who told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'We're going to change it, abolish it and it will raise a lot of money.' But it emerged in a January interview Mr Balls said: 'I think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing Britain money because there will be some people who will then leave the country.' The contradiction was seized on by the Conservatives, who produced an internet graphic showing Mr Balls' two quotes. Mr Keen, a retired GP, posted the image to his Facebook page, adding: 'Can someone explain this to me please, I am now officially confused.' In January shadow chancellor Ed Balls warned: 'I think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing Britain money because there will be some people who will then leave the country.' A friend suggested he 'ask a certain member of your family I am sure he will give you chapter and verse on it and invite him into the group I am sure we won't abuse him to much'. Mr Keen asked his friends on the site: 'What would you say to my lil cuz if he were on here?' Announcing the policy, Labour aides suggested the change in the rules, which date back to the 18th century, would raise as much as £1billion. But tax advisers immediately disputed this, saying driving non-doms away would in fact cost the Treasury significant sums. With non-doms paying around £8billion in tax and national insurance a year, it is claimed that Labour's proposal could in fact create a huge hole in Treasury coffers. Last year Mr Keen declined to say if he was planning to vote for his cousin. He told the Sunday Times: 'Ed's my cousin and I have known him all my life. That's all I can say. I don't talk about politics on the doorstep.' And he suggested that voters think David Miliband would have made a better Prime Minister. He said: 'The people out there will say David would have made a really good prime minister. That's the general feeling out there. People don't take the piss out of him. They wouldn't dare. People wouldn't take the piss out of Dave.'"
"A man took a friend's dog for a walk and hacked it to death with an axe because he was worried it might bite children. Kevin Dixon, 35, of Newsome in West Yorkshire, took his friend's Akita-type dog for a walk to help her out and then hit it seven times with an axe - killing the animal. He was convicted of causing the dog unnecessary suffering and was given a suspended prison sentence and banned from keeping animals for ten years. Kevin Dixon offered to take his fiend's Akita-type dog (pictured) out for a walk to help his friend and hacked the animal to death  because he was scared it might bite a child . Kirklees Magistrates' Court heard that Dixon had agreed to walk the dog, Tempa, for its owner Amanda Hamer who had been unable to do so after she suffered severe whiplash in early 2014. The dog had a history of biting people and Dixon had decided to kill the animal after it bit a woman, following a party at Ms Hamer's home. Dixon told the court he was worried it might bite one of the children sleeping at the house overnight. Dixon (left) was convicted after a trial of causing the dog, called Tempa (right), of unnecessary suffering . On the evening of May 16 he took the animal out for a walk and then hit it seven times in the pitch black. He had initially claimed the dog had not suffered when he attacked it and the assault had been all over and done with 'from first blow to last in 10 seconds.' Tempa was hit with the axe seven times . But he was convicted by magistrates after further evidence was presented in a case brought by the RSPCA at trial earlier in the year. Chairman of the Bench Sue Collins, told Dixon his actions were 'unacceptable' and he had caused 'suffering to the dog' but accepts 'he is remorseful and didn't want to cause harm'. Dixon was sentenced to 18 months in prison, suspended for two years. He was disqualified from keeping animals for 10 years. Catherin McCullagh, for Dixon, said: 'Clearly Mr Dixon's actions were undesirable if I can put it that way, as well as illegal.' Speaking after the sentence, Ms Hamer, 43, said: 'The sentence is too light for somebody who has taken a member of the family. 'Tempa was part of the family, my daughter's best friend. She absolutely loved him - she has had an awful time through this.'"
"Lawyers for Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman made the admission following action by ClientEarth.
But Judge Mr Justice Mitting said any enforcement action was a matter for the European Commission.
He refused to make any declaration, or to order Mrs Spelman to outline plans for cutting pollution levels.
ClientEarth had complained that Mrs Spelman had failed to consult on proposals which demonstrated how the UK aimed to comply with EU limits on levels of nitrogen dioxide.
It asked the judge to declare that plans set out by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) did not comply with EU law, and order Mrs Spelman to publish revised proposals.
Government lawyers challenged the claim and said no High Court order was needed.
Mr Justice Mitting said a lawyer had conceded that ""the government is in breach of obligations"" but said he would not make any ""mandatory order"".
He said the government could admit the breach and ""leave it to the (European) Commission to take whatever action is right in enforcement"".
""Such a mandatory order... would raise serious political and economic questions which are simply not for a judge,"" he added.
""Courts have traditionally been wary of entering this area of political debate - for good reason.""
Mr Justice Mitting pronounced the action a ""draw"" and said costs should be shared.
A spokesperson for Defra said it was happy that ""the judge has ruled on our favour"".
""A significant part of the UK meets EU air quality limits for all pollutants and air quality has improved considerably in recent decades.
""Our air quality plans set out all the important work being done at national, regional and local level to meet all EU limits in the shortest possible time,"" the spokesperson said.
Stephen Hockman QC, for ClientEarth, told the court the charity had achieved something and said: ""The government is in breach of its obligations under European law in relation to air quality.
""Although we have lost, it was a reasonable case to advance.""
A spokesman said the legal challenge had been brought because air quality plans for 17 regions and cities would not comply with legal limits for air quality until after 2015, when the deadline for achieving the limits was 1 January 2010.
He said he had wanted the court to order Mrs Spelman to draw up plans that would achieve legal compliance throughout the UK by 2015, and also to make a declaration that she was in breach of her legal obligations.
ClientEarth chief executive James Thornton said: ""The government's plans to tackle air pollution are frankly pathetic. They contain almost no new measures and show that they won't achieve air quality limits until 2025. It's nothing short of a disgrace."""
"The inaugural event - which is running until 5 November - features scores of local, national and international comedians, with Tom Stade among the headliners for the opening night.
Created by Aberdeen Inspired and Breakneck Comedy, the festival is using more than 20 city centre venues.
There will also be events aimed at children, and comedy workshops.
It is hoped it will help put the Aberdeen comedy circuit on the map.

"Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao will be the biggest fight of all time financially and the most significant this century. Evaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political, social and cultural undertones, the scale of expectation and outside influences. Where Money Man v PacMan comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. In this, the fourth in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history, I look back on one of the greatest sporting events of all time. RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE . George Foreman v Muhammad Ali . Kinshasa, Zaire . October 30, 1974 . The fight voted the greatest sporting event of the 20th century. The fight which crossed oceans and continents. The fight which drove boxing through social barriers. The fight which put a shadowy central African republic on the world map. The fight which established Muhammad Ali as the most recognisable human being on Earth. The fight which made George Foreman famous in defeat. The fight about which millions of words have been written and movies made. A photograph taken on October 30, 1974, shows Muhammad Ali (left) and George Foreman (right) USA's  Foreman (right) approaches his compatriot Ali (left)  during the iconic Rumble in the Jungle in 1974 . The Rumble in the Jungle was the brainchild of promotional genius Don King backed by the multi-million dollar investment through which Zaire president Mobuto Sese Seko hoped to excite his people into keeping him in power. King had persuaded Ali and Foreman to sign $5million contracts which he could not afford but would talk President Mobuto into bank-rolling. JOE FRAZIER v MUHAMMAD ALI . March 8, 1971, Madison Square Garden, New York . JACK JOHNSON v JAMES JEFFRIES . July 4, 1910, Reno, Nevada . JOE LOUIS v MAX SCHMELING . June 22, 1938, Yankee Stadium, New York . As the 25-year-old world heavyweight champion with enormous punching power Foreman was odds-on favourite to crush the brilliance of the man they called The Greatest but who, at 32 and diminished by his three-and-a-half-year banishment from the ring for refusing to go to war in Vietnam, was perceived as a fading force. Ali went to work on Foreman’s psyche from the moment the circus arrived in Kinshasa, turning up at his training session to mock Big George for his size and make fun of his intellect. The irritating effect on Foreman was prolonged after he suffered an eye-cut in sparring, the date of the fight was put back more than a month and King, fearful of cancellation, insisted they stayed in Zaire instead of taking a break back in America. Ali also charmed the local population, who happily took to the streets throughout those weeks chanting ‘Ali, boma-ye’ – ‘Ali, kill him.’ The fight developed into a tactical triumph for Ali, albeit a self-punishing one which may have contributed to the subsequent onset of Parkinson’s which afflicts him now. Ali (left) often found himself against the ropes in a strategy which even surprised his trainer Angelo Dundee . Ali spent much of his time against the ropes, inviting Foreman to punch himself out before landing his blow . In a strategy which he later entitled ‘Rope-A-Dope’ – and which came as a surprise to everyone including his fabled trainer Angelo Dundee - Ali spent much of his time lolling against the ropes, inviting Foreman to punch himself out. Big George duly obliged by throwing hundreds of blows in the first seven rounds. Ali evaded many of those punches and blocked numerous with his arms but he had to withstand the brute force of those which got through his defences. The verbal taunting went on. ‘They told me you could punch, George,’ he said as Foreman began to flag. ‘Is that all you got, George?’ he rasped as Foreman connected to the Ali chin with virtually the last of the punches which had knocked out many a former foe. It had not been all negative. Throughout, Ali had peppered the swelling Foreman face with break-out with lightning combinations and the steamy 4 am heat had contributed to the weakening process. Foreman, the world heavyweight champion, is down on count two after being struck by Ali's right-hander . Ali looks on after he knocked Foreman to the canvas with the holy mother of all right-handers during the bout . Come the eighth round, come the coup de grace. A succession of right hooks, a two-fisted burst and then a left-hook which straightened up Big George to receive the holy mother of all right-handers. Foreman staggered to his feet at the count of nine but referee Zack Clayton knew he was finished. Sensation. Bedlam in the jungle. Astonishment around the satellite world. Foreman would eventually emerge from denial to become Ali’s great friend, an inspiring Christian preacher and the seller of countless top-of-the-range barbecues. Ali was still The Greatest. Ali's staff and the referee put their arms around Ali after he settled the Rumble in the Jungle in 1974 ."
"Saturday's 28-20 loss at Worcester Warriors kept the Falcons pinned to the foot of the table, and was the fourth defeat of the new campaign.
London Irish have also yet to record a win, but have better points difference.
""We're a much better side than that, there's far more to come out from us,"" Richards told BBC Newcastle.
""We haven't quite got our attack sorted out yet and our defence is all over the place - if we got one of those sorted out it wouldn't be a problem.
""The defence was woeful in the first half and oddly we won the second half 3-0, but I'm frustrated more than anything.""
Saturday's game was the first in which all of the World Cup duty players had been available, with Argentina centre Juan Pablo Socino restored to the starting line-up.
However, not even his introduction helped, as errors continued to plague the Falcons' attempts to end their pointless run.
""At half-time it was about getting it right and understanding where we had gone wrong defensively - which was one-on-one tackles and a few ill-discipline issues, such as lifting the leg in the line-out five metres from their line,"" said Richards.
""Those things made a big difference, and we're doing it week in, week out and it's the same people who are doing it unfortunately."""
"Merlin Entertainments Group (MEG), which runs the attraction, filed an application in 2014 to build lodges which was rejected by the council.
The Warwick Society said the plans for glamping - or luxury camping - were not in keeping with the landscape.
MEG has previously said the site would ""benefit the wider economy"".
The firm applied for permission to erect up to 20 permanent lodges, and create room for 41 glamping tents on land known as ""Foxes Study"".
It was previously granted permission to erect a temporary site for ""medieval glamorous camping"".
Neighbours at the site objected to the lodges, with one saying the move would be the ""first step in turning this historic heritage site into a theme park"".
James Mackay, chairman of the Warwick Society, said: ""Merlin is a very successful company but the proposal to use part of a Grade I listed landscape for holiday lodges is not at all satisfactory.""
Warwick District Council said any public inquiry would probably be held in March.
However, it added MEG had submitted a revised application - a ""scaled-down"" version of the original - which would go before the planning committee in September or October.
MEG said: ""Warwick Castle submitted an appeal to the decision to refuse our planning application to build new accommodation, several month ago.
""However we have also been working closely with the experts at Historic England to develop a significantly revised and reduced accommodation proposal which we hope will be approved.  If the current application is approved we will not progress with the appeal."""
"Lane Bryant has come up with a devil of an idea to market its lingerie while poking fun at a competitor. The plus-size clothing retailer has launched an ad campaign for its Cacique line titled #ImNoAngel, seeking to ""redefine sexy."" In a commercial posted on You Tube, a group of plus-size models show off the bras and panties while saying things like ""How boring would it be if we were all the same?"" and ""It's all about how you feel."" The campaign is a not-so-subtle dig at Victoria's Secret and its very popular Angels line, which caters to smaller women. The lingerie giant was criticized last year for a campaign featuring the words ""Perfect Body"" over images of slender supermodels, and Business Insider reports that it is under increasing pressure from consumers to offer larger sizes. Lane Bryant's campaign is getting positive buzz in social media land, with the company being hailed for celebrating beauty of all shapes and sizes. ""Our '#ImNoAngel' campaign is designed to empower ALL women to love every part of herself,"" Chief Executive Officer Linda Heasley said in a statement. ""Lane Bryant firmly believes that she is sexy and we want to encourage her to confidently show it, in her own way."" The ads will be featured in the company's stores, on television, in print and on billboards, as well as featured on the brand's social media accounts."
"Hospital radiographer Aidan McNicholl, 36, died following the collision on the A5 at Cerrigydrudion on Sunday.
Andreas Werner, 46, of Leipzig, failed to spot the motorcyclist as he turned his VW Transporter right causing the fatal crash.
The father-of-four pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving at Llandudno Magistrates' Court.
He was fined Â£1,000 and also banned from driving in the UK for two years.
Prosecutor Sarah Marsh told the court the victim's family saw no value in Werner, who was staying in a cottage with his family near Bala, being sent to jail.
She said: ""They accept it was a momentary lapse and nothing will bring him back.""
Craig Hutchinson, defending, said Werner was remorseful and could offer no explanation for the crash."
"Vardy, 29, has not scored for the champions since 10 September - a run of 14 games - but netted in England's 2-2 friendly draw with Spain last week.
His form is in stark contrast to a year ago, when he scored for a record 11th Premier League game in a row.
""He has restarted and is very close to scoring,"" said Ranieri.
""He has started to also score in training, and that is good news because also, in the training, he didn't score so well.""
Vardy has scored twice in the league this season compared with 13 at the same stage in 2015-16. He finished last season with 28 goals in 48 appearances for club and country.
Since his last club goal, the Foxes have slipped to 14th in the table with just two wins in nine matches.
Ranieri believes Vardy and team-mate Riyad Mahrez no longer boast the ""surprise"" factor that worked in their favour last season.
The Italian said: ""That is the big problem. Jamie is always normal, the same last season. You don't see him nervous or frustrated.
""But sooner or later Vardy will come back. I speak every day with him. He is very calm, very concentrated in his job, to work for the team.""
Leicester, who have qualified from their Champions League group with a game to spare, host Middlesbrough in the Premier League on Saturday (15:00 GMT)."
"Huge military exercises are underway off and around Britain's coast, but NATO insists they are not a deliberate response to the Russian military's increasingly brazen behavior. The British-led war games are code named Joint Warrior and the numbers are all big: 13,000 personnel from 14 countries operating more than 50 ships and submarines as well as 70 aircraft. NATO says the planning started long before Russia began behaving as an adversary. For more than a year NATO has been condemning Russia's actions in Ukraine as well as its frequent, large scale, snap military drills and those long-range Bear bombers repeatedly flying very close to NATO airspace. So, if Joint Warrior is not a deliberate response, it's certainly a timely one. CNN was invited to spend a day aboard one of the vessels taking part -- the U.S. Navy's guided missile cruiser USS Vicksburg. It's the current flag ship of a standing NATO maritime group. Commanding officer Rear Adm. Brad Williamson says Russia's behavior is an added motivation to do well in these exercises. ""Anytime you have a security situation that reminds us it's not just a game we're doing out here, that there are real world implications to our ability to provide security to alliance members, I think that focuses our minds on what we're doing,"" Williamson says. Other personnel on the Vicksburg tell us competition between different nations and even individual ships and subs is also a big motivator. The details of these war games are top secret. But they're broken into two parts: The set training exercises that involve vessels or groups completing specific jobs and what they call ""free play"". That's where everyone's divided into two teams with different orders and motivations manipulated by the game masters. Tensions rise and it's likely pretend war follows. Easy to see how things get competitive. Russia has taken an interest. It used its right under what's known as the Vienna document to send its own inspectors. NATO says they only stayed a few days and didn't see anything sensitive."
"Sam Simmonds was forced over as the clock wound down to deny Sarries, who beat Clermont to win the Champions Cup last Saturday, in a tense semi-final.
Jack Nowell's try put Chiefs ahead after it was 6-6 at half-time, but Chris Wyles' try brought Saracens back.
Mike Ellery put Sarries in front on 76 minutes, before Simmonds' heroics.
The last-gasp victory gained revenge for Exeter, who had lost out to Saracens in their first Premiership final 12 months ago, while extending the Chiefs' unbeaten league run to 16 matches.
Two early Owen Farrell penalties were cancelled out by Gareth Steenson's two three-pointers as both sides had great chances to score in the opening half.
First Wyles was denied by a last-ditch Nowell interception, and then Thomas Waldrom was held up by the Saracens defence as he went over the line.
But straight after the break Exeter hit their straps, Nowell finishing off after Phil Dollman had broken through before setting Ollie Devoto away.
The home side's dogged defence kept Saracens, who lost former England winger Chris Ashton to an early injury, at bay.
But Mark McCall's side always looked dangerous with ball in hand, and so it proved as Wyles went over in the left corner after a delayed pass from Maro Itoje with 23 minutes left.
Ellery, who had replaced Ashton, had the Saracens coaching staff leaping for joy when he cart-wheeled over the line despite the desperate efforts of Nowell and Michele Campagnaro to stop him.
But England's Henry Slade, on as a replacement, blasted a perfect penalty deep into the Saracens 22 and Exeter secured the resulting line-out, allowing the Chiefs to drive academy graduate Simmonds over for the decisive score.
Could Exeter become the ninth team to be crowned champions of England?
If so, it would cap a seismic rise up rugby union's league system. Promoted to the top flight in 2010 under the guidance of Rob Baxter and assistant Ali Hepher, the Chiefs have gradually built a side greater than the sum of its parts.
Only seven of their starters have played any international rugby, while in contrast just two of the Saracens side - Michael Rhodes and Jackson Wray - had never featured for their country.
But a combination of home-grown stars, such as England's Nowell, Slade and Luke Cowan-Dickie, a sprinkling of international imports such as Waldrom and the experience of players like Ben Moon, Dollman and Steenson - who were all part of that promotion-winning side - has proved to be incredibly successful at home.
Whatever the result in next week's final, Exeter have established themselves as a force in the domestic game.
Exeter Chiefs forwards coach Rob Hunter:
""The biggest challenge we've got now, certainly from a coaching point of view, is that you almost instantly go 'we've not just won the Premiership, what we've just won is the semi-final'.
""So you do very quickly get through that and our biggest job now is not pretending we're champions.
""We've beaten the European champions, we've beaten a very good side, but we've got to beat one of these two (Wasps and Leicester) to win it, so it means nothing if we go there next week and we don't perform.""
Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall:
""That was one of the great kicks of all time from Henry Slade - if he puts that somewhere else I'm probably stood here taking about one of the great wins and one of the great fights from a team who are a little bit tired.
""We're sad, of course we are, and it's going to be painful, but we can be unbelievably proud of the qualities that showed during that second half.
""I'm pleased that we showed the fight, we didn't do much wrong to lose the match, to be honest.""
Exeter: Dollman; Nowell, Whitten, Devoto, Short; Steenson (capt), Townsend; Moon, Cowan-Dickie, Williams, Dennis, Parling, Horstmann, Armand, Waldrom.
Replacements: Yeandle, Rimmer, Francis, Lees, S Simmonds, Chudley, Slade, Campagnaro.

"When The Beatles first performed at the Cavern on 9 February, 1961, it was so low key it wasn't even advertised.
A year and a half, and 292 performances, later, the group was set for stardom and the Cavern would become one of the world's most famous clubs.
While both Lennon and McCartney had already played the club as The Quarrymen, the un-advertised lunchtime session was George Harrison's first appearance at the Cavern.
The club's lunchtime sessions were popular with young city centre office workers and many would take sandwiches to eat while watching the groups.
The current Cavern has organised a day of events to mark the anniversary and is inviting regulars from the early 1960s to attend. The day of live Beatles music starts with a lunchtime session at 1300 GMT.
A 40-metre long light installation is being created across Mathew Street, called Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. It will create a ceiling of light along the Cavern Quarter area.
The original Cavern had started life as a jazz venue in 1957 but by 1961 it was moving towards rock and roll - driven more by plain economics than any change in musical taste.
Promoter Sam Leach was instrumental in transforming the Cavern's music policy away from the jazz favoured by owner Ray McFall.
Mr Leach said: ""It was a good club and it was exciting.
""Ray McFall hated rock and roll. On March 11th 1961, I did the Iron Door (a rival Liverpool club)  - I did an all night session and it got 1,800 people, that night the Cavern had 50 people in, more musicians than fans.
""Ten days later...Ray gets the message and he turns over to rock and roll at night. Up until then The Beatles only played at lunchtime.""
The Beatles had played other Merseyside venues since returning from Hamburg in late 1960, but it was at the Cavern that they would cement their reputation as one of the city's top rock and roll groups.
Many who saw The Beatles at the club claim that was where they were at their best as a live outfit. Mr Leach's first taste of The Beatles was at a venue in Huyton.
He said: ""When I first saw them in Hamilton Hall as soon as they started playing, I was just gobsmacked.
""The sound didn't just go over you it went through you.
""John Lennon started with Slow Down and Paul did Hippy Hippy Shake, Stuart did Wooden Heart, Pete Best did Matchbox. The sound was so powerful, it seemed to reverberate around the hall.
""We more or less took American rock and roll and sent it back at them improved. We gave them better sound, which was Merseybeat.
""Make no mistake the Cavern has become the most famous club in the world.
""It makes me smile when they say: 'The Cavern where it all began' - they were the last ones in. But it was an exciting club.""
In November 1961, record store manager Brian Epstein saw The Beatles at the Cavern and soon after became their manager.
A record deal with Parlophone would follow but not before the band's sound and image had been subtlety changed.
""The Beatles were the best rock band on the planet"", Mr Leach remembers.
""Eppy [Brian Epstein] took them and he groomed them, and took all that rawness out of them, and fair enough it worked. But I know John didn't like it because John was an out and out rock and roller.
""Paul was sensible he knew you had to sort of bend a little bit and become a bit more showbiz. So he went along with Epstein and really, Paul was right.""
Paul McCartney returned his roots at the Cavern in December 1999 to play a one-off concert, but it wasn't on the same stage that he had played from almost 300 times in the early 1960s.
The original Cavern club closed in 1973 and was demolished to make way for a ventilation shaft for Liverpool's new underground railway loop line. The shaft was never built and the current Cavern club is recreated across three quarters of the original site, using many of the old club's bricks.
Exactly three year's after their first Cavern appearance on 9 February, 1964, The Beatles performed on The Ed Sullivan Show playing to a record 73 million people across America.
Beatlemania had arrived."
"Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are two dynamic leaders at the helm of the world's two most populous nations. And one is particularly vocal about making his mark on history. When India successfully placed a spacecraft into orbit around Mars last year, Modi reveled in the moment. ""History has been created today,"" he said. ""We have dared to reach out into the unknown and have achieved the near impossible. ""The success of our space program is a shining symbol of what we are capable of as a nation."" Soon after the galactic feat, he took to the stage at New York's famous Madison Square Garden and received a welcome so rapturous that Jon Stewart called him ""America's First Modi."" And all along, Modi has issued his call to ""Make in India,"" encouraging companies all over the world to manufacture their products in India where there is a vast talent pool and low-cost production. While Modi's India is out to put its economy on the fast track, China's economy is slowing after over 25 years of breakneck growth. President Xi is managing the slowdown with efforts to boost domestic spending, while cracking down hard on corruption. And it's been predicted that India could outpace China as the world's fastest growing economy as soon as this year. So is the world's largest democracy primed to overtake the world's biggest single party state as the next economic miracle? OPINION: What India can learn from China . Not so fast, says China watcher and India Today correspondent Ananth Krishnan. ""China is still pulling away from India,"" the Beijing-based reporter said. ""If India grows 7.5% this year and China grows 7.4%, I think it makes a good headline.  But I think people shouldn't get carried away about what it means in terms of a gap between China and India."" China's economy may be slowing down but India faces a longer list of economic challenges including higher unemployment, chronic inflation and an overwhelming lack of basic infrastructure. ""In terms of education, having access to different resources, and job creation, China has done well. It has progressed far better compared to India,"" said Infosys China CEO Rangarajan R. Vellamore. ""Even though there is free movement across the country (in India), the paradox is there are a lot of basic issues related to access to water and basic education."" In a recent budget, the Modi government announced plans to boost infrastructure spending as well as cut taxes on businesses among other initiatives to spur economic growth. But despite Modi's big pro-business push, India simply can't size up against China's raw economic might. ""After 30 years of dedicated efforts in building China into a manufacturing powerhouse, it would take a long time for India to build that kind of manufacturing capability,"" said Haiyan Wang, Managing Partner of the China India Institute. ""It's not just about lower labor costs. You have to have a complex industry cluster of supply chains. You have to have the knowledge. You have to have the skills. You have to be connected to the international market,"" she said. ""So when you ask if India could compete with China, I don't think that is going to be happening -- not in the next 20 years."" The Indian elephant may be charging ahead, but the sinewy dragon has the muscle to stay ahead. China has the capacity, the connectivity, and the capital to throw its weight around. And being a single party state with no free elections, Xi can march toward a long-term goal without fretting about the next election. But that's not to say the autocracy has the advantage on all fronts, especially when it comes to winning hearts and minds in the region. ""Even if China is putting money into the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Silk Road fund, it is also building airstrips on reclaimed islands on the South China Sea,"" said Krishnan. ""There no question that India's rise is far less threatening than China's rise."" With the 1962 border dispute still vividly remembered by many in India, the impression of China as a threat stands in the way of further economic integration between the two countries. ""If you look at India's seven northeastern states, which are probably in the most dire need of infrastructure, it's inconceivable for any of those states to allow a Chinese company to come and build roads,"" said Krishnan. So when Modi touches down in Beijing next month for his second meeting with Xi, can both leaders cast aside areas of political tension to get down to business? ""As pragmatic as President Xi is, as pragmatic as Prime Minister Modi is, economic integration is going to happen regardless of 100% trust or not,"" said Haiyan Wang. Eased by the pragmatism of two ambitious leaders, the elephant and the dragon could together leap at the opportunity for a strong economic alliance. ""If these two countries come together, 40% of the world's people are going to be prosperous,"" said Vellamore. ""If they are able to come together, there can be a new kind of world order in the entire region which is going to benefit all of Asia."" It's a moment for both leaders to make a lasting mark on history."
"A 20-year-old man was with a male friend in Old Rutherglen Road when another man attacked him with a weapon at about 13:05 on 22 September.
The victim was treated in hospital for a leg injury.
Detectives believe the man in the images may be able to help with their inquiry. He is described as white, aged about 20, with short brown hair.
At the time of the incident, he was wearing a tracksuit top that was white at the front and light blue at the back, dark tracksuit trousers and dark trainers.

"The owners of an Indiana pizza shop who refused to cater a gay wedding have gone into hiding - but plan to re-open soon after raising $500,000. Memories Pizza in Walkerton faced criticism this week after co-owner Crystal O'Connor expressed support for a new Indiana religious objections law. Despite 'keeping a low profile' Crystal O'Connor and her father Kevin O'Connor went on Fox News on Thursday to discuss their comments and and the backlash they've received. It was revealed on Thursday that the pizza shop has never catered a wedding before. Scroll down for videos . In hiding: Crystal O'Connor and her father Kevin O'Connor said they'll re-open soon but were forced to close the doors to their pizza shop because the phones kept ringing and they didn't know if orders were fake or real . 'Anger. Bitterness. It's something I never expected or imagined when the comments were made. It's just unimaginable to me,' said Kevin when asked about the reaction to his daughter saying she would deny gay couples pizza on their wedding day. When asked if they'll ever re-open their pizza place Kevin said he initially shut down because he 'couldn't tell if they were getting real orders or fake orders' and said that the phone rang all day and all night. 'We plan to re-open soon we just don't know when,' Crystal said. A contributor from Glenn Beck's The Blaze set up the fundraising page on GoFundMe for the pizzeria, with a goal of helping 'the family stave off the burdensome cost of having the media parked out front, activists tearing them down, and no customers coming in'. Controversy: The O'Connors made their comments a week after the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was passed, forbidding state or local government from 'substantially 'burdening' a person's right to their beliefs . up in arms: Demonstrators  gather outside the City County Building on March 30 in Indianapolis to protest the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act . A new Indiana law passed yesterday states that no one has the legal right to 'refuse to offer or provide' goods, services, facilities or employment to anyone in previously protected classes or based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The news comes a little after a week  Indiana passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics say would allow businesses to openly discriminate against gays, and just a few days after his daughter told a local news station they would refuse to serve a gay marriage ceremony. Speaking to ABC57 on Tuesday, Crystal O'Connor said: 'If a gay couple came in and wanted us to provide pizzas for their wedding, we would have to say no.’ According to TMZ, O'Connor tried to clarify his views, saying he would never refuse to serve gay customers, but as a Christian he disagrees with gay marriage, and so would refuse to serve a same-sex wedding. The pizza joint has been in operation for nine years. The interior of the old-fashioned eatery is adorned with crosses and bible quotes. Just outside the pizzeria, a signs states that the staff begin each morning with a prayer. 'We are a Christian establishment,' Crystal O’Connor confirmed, but pointed out that their business practices are not biased. Shuttered: Memories Pizza in Indiana, whose owners Crystal and Kevin O'Connor (pictured) said they would refuse to cater a gay wedding, closed its doors after being abused over the phone and online . ‘We're not discriminating against anyone, that's just our belief and anyone has the right to believe in anything,’ insisted O'Connor. When Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a Republican, signed the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law last week, the O’Connor family in Walkerton applauded his decision. The measure prohibits state and local government from ‘substantially burdening’ the ability of people — including businesses — to follow their religious beliefs. Pence said in a statement last Thursday that the bill ensures ‘religious liberty is fully protected under Indiana law.’ Critics of the legislation said it could allow discrimination against gay people, but its supporters claimed the bill merely seeks to prevent the government from compelling people to provide such things as catering or photography for same-sex weddings or other activities they find objectionable on religious grounds. Several reviewers invoked Adolf Hitler and the KKK in their eviscerating assessments of the pizzeria but they have since been taken down . Crystal O’Connor, of Memories Pizza, dismissed discrimination concerns, saying the law is not targeting gays - it merely helps people that have strong religious beliefs. She added that as a devout Christian, she does not support same-sex marriage – a conviction shared by her father. He said: ‘That lifestyle is something they choose. I choose to be heterosexual. They choose to be homosexual. Why should I be beat over the head to go along with something they choose?’ The Facebook and Yelp pages for the restaurant about 20 miles southwest of South Bend were bombarded with over 300 mixed reviews and their pizza place has currently just 2.5 stars following the family's controversial statements. A coach of a high school golf program was suspended after a Twitter post he wrote mentioned going to Walkerton and burning down the restaurant. The picture section of the review page has was swamped with images, some of which contain explicit content, supporting homosexuality and gay rights. It appears as though those images have since been taken down. One five-star review, written from the point of view of 'Adolf. H' no longer on the page stated: ‘Memories Pizza had been recommended to me by my buddy Herman years ago - and his praise was well deserved. ‘The largely Aryan ownership manages their subhuman staff quite well. No y*** or q****s to speak of and the tomato sauce was pretty decent for canned.’ No longer on yelp: The pizzeria's Yelp page was targeted by those who disagreed with the O'Connors' statements, attracting hundreds of one star reviews, some of which were removed . User Marco V. wrote in his review in part: 'You don't want sinners coming into your business? guess what? We are all sinners.' The review was accompanied by a meme of Crystal O'Connor with a speech bubble that read: 'Jesus said bigotry is great for sales!' Many Yelpers mocked Ms O’Connor’s suggestion that anyone would want to order pizza for their wedding reception. 'As a pizza loving lesbian - I would NEVER serve pizza at my wedding. Morons,' fumed Laura D from Long Beach, New York. Another critic of the Walkerton establishment joked that their discriminatory practices did not go far enough. ‘I’m ANGRY and will never order pizza from these people again because they're simply not discriminatory enough! I mean, just ""gays""? What about anyone who works on Sundays (Leviticus 23:3)? People who wear makeup (Jeremiah 4:30)? Hungry people (Proverbs 23:2)? Men without beards (Leviticus 19:27)? Tattooed people (Leviticus 19:28)? People who eat shellfish (Leviticus 11:10)? People with messy hair (Leviticus 10:6)? New mothers (Leviticus 12:4-5)? Psychics or mediums (Leviticus 20:27)?’ A small number of people have come to the O’Connors' defense amid an avalanche of negative comments. Lori Childers wrote on the eatery’s Facebook page: ‘God Bless you for standing up for your rights, its YOUR business and you should run it however you see fit. Sick of LBGT denying me of my God given rights. Go find another store to shop at or hey open your own store.......’ Governor Pence addressed the backlash against the bill in a Wall Street Journal op-ed piece published Monday, writing that he abhors discrimination. 'If I saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, I wouldn’t eat there anymore,' he said."
"The two brothers allegedly sold Musadikur Rohaman's BMW car, his wife's wedding dress and Â£1,200 worth of family gold to raise funds for him in Syria.
The two men, from Walsall, West Midlands, deny terrorism funding offences. Another two men, also appearing at the Old Bailey, deny funding offences.
All four say the money was to help Musadikur come back to the UK.
Prosecuting, Julian Christopher QC, said dry cleaners Mohammed Hussain, 26, and Mohamed Rohaman, 32, collected a total of Â£10,000 for their brother, a fighter in Raqqa.
Musadikur and his wife Zohura Siddeka, a teacher, both 27, left for Syria in December 2014.
""Musadikur had told people that he was going on holiday, but the true purpose for his trip was to go to Syria to join and fight for IS, and that is what he did,"" Mr Christopher said.
Mr Hussain also recruited family friends Mohammed Khan, 27 and Maruf Uddin, 26, both accountants, to help raise funds by taking out credit card loans and selling valuables, Mr Christopher said.
""This case concerns the steps which these four defendants took, in various different ways, to help Musadikur by sending money out to him, by selling items belonging to him and his wife, by obtaining a credit card and by extracting money from his and his wife's bank accounts."""
"US-based golf course designers Mike Keiser, Bill Coore and Todd Warnock have proposed creating the course at Coul Links, near Dornoch.
Four conservation charities have joined forces to oppose the project.
The developers said they were aiming for ""minimal intrusion on the landscape"".
The Scottish Wildlife Trust, RSPB Scotland, Buglife and Plantlife have concerns the course will result in the loss of a protected sand dunes habitat and rare wildlife.
The developers, who have held two meetings in the local area as part of public consultation on the plans, said the building of the course would involve laying turf over less than 55 acres (22ha) within a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).
SSSIs are areas indentified as having a diverse range of wildlife and geology.
The developers said their planned new course, close to Embo, would compliment nearby Royal Dornoch golf course and others in the East Sutherland area.
Mr Keiser, who owns Bandon Dunes Golf Resort in Oregon, said: ""This is a wonderful opportunity to deliver a spectacular championship links golf course which represents all that is natural about golf, in the home of golf.
""Our golf course developments aim for minimal intrusion on the landscape and the utmost care and respect for the environment.

"Haunting never-before-seen images showing Captain Scott's doomed expedition team setting off on their ill-fated trek to the South Pole have sold for a staggering £30,000. The archive of 52 celluloid negatives show the great British adventurer and his men heading off in the snow-covered wilderness during the ill-fated Terra Nova Expedition of 1912. Some of the pictures show the herd of ponies the team used to haul the equipment-laden sledges on the 800 mile trek that would end with the deaths of Scott and the polar party of Edward Wilson, Lawrence Oates, Edger Evans and Henry Bowers. Scroll down for video . Almost ready: The pictures show Captain Scott's team preparing to depart on their ill-fated Terra Nova Expedition of 1912.

The unseen photographs of the Antarctic expedition have been sold at auction for £36,000 to an unnamed buyer . The images also show the team of husky dogs used for part of the expedition. The two types of animal proved to be Scott's downfall as he got rid of the dogs on the final leg of the trek, wrongly believing they would not make the ascent of Beardmore Glacier. In the event, Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen beat Scott to the pole by 34 days, largely because his team used dogs to haul their gear the entire way rather than use slower ponies. Two of the men featured in the archive were dog handlers Cecil Meares and Dimitri Gerof. Other pictures in the archive show the flimsy-looking pyramid tents that sheltered the men from the bone-chilling temperatures of -70F as well as them trekking in the snow. There are also general shots of the harsh landscape and ice shelves that only a handful of men had visited until that point.

"The widow of a cardiac surgeon shot dead at a Boston hospital by his patient's son has given birth to their fourth child, a baby girl, less than three months after the doctor's slaying. Brigham and Women's Hospital announced Monday that Mikaela Jane Davidson was born April 4. Mikaela's father, Dr. Michael Davidson, was killed at the hospital January 20, leaving behind his wife, Dr. Terri Halperin, daughters Kate, 10, Live, 8, and their 2-year-old son, Graham. Scroll down for video . New life: Mikaela Jane Davidson was welcomed into the world April 4, less than three months after her father, Boston heart surgeon Dr Michael Davidson, was shot dead by a deceased patient's son . Heartbroken: Dr. Terri Halperin (left), a mother of fourth, said in a statement her late husband, Dr Michael Davidson (right), was looking forward to meeting his new baby daughter . 'Michael was very much looking forward to the birth of this beautiful baby girl,' Halperin said in a statement released through the hospital. 'At a time when my children and I are completely heartbroken over the loss of Michael, we are finding joy in Mikaela's arrival.' The hospital said the mother and baby Mikaela, who was named after her father, were both doing well. A beloved surgeon who was targeted and fatally shot by gunman at a Boston hospital on Tuesday was expecting his fourth child with his wife, who is seven months pregnant, it has emerged. Dr Davidson, 44, from Wellesley, Massachusetts, was shot by Stephen Pasceri, 55, on the morning of January 20 and passed away late that evening. Pasceri's relatives suggested that he was angry over the death of his mother, whom Dr Davidson had treated. Vendetta: Accountant Stephen Pasceri (left and right) opened fire on Davidson at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital January 20. The doctor died and Pasceri, a father of four, took his own life after the shooting . 'You all should be absolutely assured that Michael Davidson was one of the kindest, best possible men that ever walked on this earth,' colleague Dr. Andrew Eisenhauer said at the time, ABC News reported. 'We knew that and his patients knew that and his family knows that.' The gunman, an accountant and married father-of-four, had walked into the heart center and asked for Dr Davidson, before shooting him twice and taking his own life in a separate room. In the days after the tragedy, Davidson's father-in-law told the Boston Herald how the doctor had yelled for patients and staff to flee before he was shot. 'He was a hero - he told everybody to get out,' he said. 'He started yelling, ""Get out. Get out."" He knew it was coming.' He recalled how much he cared for his patients, and added: 'He loved his family. He loved his kids. He loved my daughter to death.' A fund has been set up for the family here. Left behind: Davidson and his wife Terri, pictured, have two daughters, seven and nine, and a son, two. She was seven months pregnant with their fourth child at the time of the shooting . Mourning: Brigham and Women's Hospital doctors, from the left, Charles Morris, Andrew Eisenhauer, Daniel Wiener and Pinak Shah appear emotional as they face members of the media to speak about Davidson . Pasceri's family have said they can't understand why he snapped, but they believe he could have been wanting to enact revenge on Dr. Davidson after his mother, Marguerite, died last fall. Davidson had treated Marguerite Pasceri for a cardiovascular condition during her stay at Brigham and Women's last year. She died on November 15, 2014. Pasceri, who was licensed to carry a firearm, may have also been holding a vendetta because of the health care his father Greg received during a fatal hear attack in December 2011. The Worcester Telegram reported that in 2012, Pasceri became so furious that his mother had been left with a $8,000 medical bill, he wrote to Senator John Kerry and US Rep. James McGovern to demand an investigation. However, the newspaper noted that the Pasceri family had no issue with the level of care received by their father at Massachusetts General Hospital. Pasceri's sister said she was stunned that her brother had attacked the doctor. Blame game: Marguerite E. (Olofson) Pasceri passed away on November 15, 2014 and it is thought that her son and executor, Stephen Pasceri blamed Dr. Davidson at Brigham and Women's Hospital for her passing . Heartbroken: Administrators and staff at a leading Boston hospital are mourning the death of a cardiac surgeon who was fatally shot at the hospital by a man who then killed himself . Sadness: The hospital's logo flag was lowered to half-staff during a Wednesday ceremony to honor Davidson . 'Everything seemed to be going really well. I have no idea why he snapped like this,' said Marguerite Jolym, according to the Boston Herald. According to Joly, her brother 'deeply loved' his mother and said her 'warm, compassionate, generous and understanding personality was a gift and example to the world'. 'I think it comes down to the fact that my brother thought it was the doctor's fault that my mother died,' Joly said. 'I don't know why my brother would blame him. I really don't know why.' According to the Boston Herald, Pasceri worked as an accountant for Waters Corp, which is based in Milford. Marguerite Joly said her brother served in the military for a time and was honorably discharged and was a married father of four. 'We can't even wrap our brains around this,' she said. 'There was no indication whatsoever that he would ever do anything like this... All his ducks were in a row,' she said. 'This was not a bad, evil man. Something happened, and I don't know what.' Response: Boston Police Superintendent-in-Chief William Gross, (center left), walks through a revolving door as he departs the Shapiro building at Brigham and Women's Hospital on Tuesday after the shooting . Evacuation: Medical personnel walk past law enforcement officials, (right), as they depart the Shapiro building after the cardiologist was shot . Multiple agencies: The FBI, Boston Police Department and the ATF all arrived at the hospital after the incident on Tuesday morning . Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said officers conducting a room-by-room search found the gunman dead in an exam room with the weapon. Shortly after the shooting, one witness said that the Shapiro building had been placed on lockdown and dozens of emergency vehicles had arrived on the scene. 'Once we were clear of the waiting room, there were police officers with their weapons drawn yelling, 'Get down! Get down,'' said one man to WCVB. Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh said he was 'deeply saddened' by Davidson's death. 'This tragedy is the result of a senseless act of violence that has no place in our City,' he said in a statement a day after the shooting. Hospital employees are well-drilled for the nightmare scenario of a shooter inside the building. In November 2013, doctors and nurses and other staff at the world-famous institution underwent training for an active shooter situation and viewed a video for a so-called 'Code Silver' event."
"His solicitor Julia Cooper has asked Surrey Police to explain a statement that he had confessed to the murder.
Bellfield, 47, was given a whole-life prison sentence in June 2011 for murdering the schoolgirl.
Surrey Police confirmed it had received a letter from Bellfield's solicitors but said it was standing by its statement on the confession.
Milly was kidnapped while on her way from school to her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002.
Ms Cooper said Bellfield, now known as Yusuf Rahim, believed a ""covert tape"" may have been used to record his response to a police interview in prison.
She said ""my client denies giving a confession"".
She has written to Surrey Police requesting the tape recording and notes from the meeting.
Ms Cooper said Bellfield contacted her very soon after Surrey Police distributed its press statement relating to the Dowler case.
She said Bellfield denies all the crimes for which he has been convicted.
Last month, Surrey Police revealed Bellfield had made the admission during an investigation into whether he had an accomplice involved in the abduction and rape, but not murder, of Milly.
The force said it stood by its original statement.
A police source speaking to the BBC would not comment on how the admission was recorded.
Milly's body was found 25 miles away from where she was kidnapped, in Yateley Heath, Hampshire.
Experts could not say how she died.
Bellfield was found guilty of abducting and murdering the teenager following a trial at the Old Bailey where a judge described him as a ""cruel and pitiless killer"".
He was already in jail for the murders of Amelie Delagrange, 22, and Marsha McDonnell, 19, and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, 18, when he went on trial accused of killing Milly.
He lived 50 yards from where Milly vanished but did not become a suspect until he was arrested by police in London for the other crimes in 2004.
On Wednesday, the Dowler family revealed harrowing details of Milly's final hours, saying they had been made aware of her suffering last year after Bellfield had spoken to police."
"A New Zealand couple needed a home upon returning home after living in the UK, so they built one on the back of an old flatbed truck. Hannah and Alex purchased a 1986 Hino flatbed and undertook their year and a half labor of love. The result was a solar-powered two-bedroom, wood and steel home that now allows them to live almost self-sufficiently in Nelson, New Zealand. How a truck becomes a home: A New Zealand couple built this country home on the bed of a flatbed truck . Making do: Alex (left) and Hannah (right) wanted a home that was cozy and all their own, but couldn't afford to buy a full-sized lot . 'We came back to New Zealand from the UK in 2009,' Alex told Smoking Tire. 'We knew we couldn't afford to buy property at that point. We didn't have money.' So, the couple started building. After a year and a half of taking the project one step at a time, the project took shape. Though, to hear Hannah tell it, they just slapped up the place in a weekend. '[We] welded a frame, put the wood on and built this house,' the modest Kiwi told Smoking Tire's Matt Farah. Once they finished, the couple drove their truck home out to a lot they'd purchased in Nelson, New Zealand. Now the couple and their cat live surrounded by nature: aromatic cypress wood inside the home and majestic trees and a babbling brook outside their door. Ingenuity: The couple started with a steel frame and slowly, project by project, built a home in about a year and a half . Gorgeous: Hannah and Alex now have a gorgeous, wood-lined home in a lot surrounded by trees and a babbling brook . Details: The couple has a wood-fired stove to keep out the cold, stained glass windows and other creature comforts . They're nearly self-sufficient, too. The home is powered mostly by solar panels. Alex said their first power bill was just $25. The stove and hot water are gas-powered and water comes from a nearby spring. 'I didn't want to live inside a plastic box,' Alex said. 'Not because I'm a hippie but because it feels nicer and is just a nicer place to be.' All told, the project cost Hannah and Alex about $25,000. And the couple even plans to build another one like one day. 'It's really, really nice,' Hannah said. 'We love it.' Two bedrooms: The home has a bedroom for the couple as well as a loft that doubles as a spare room where the cat sleeps . Green: Water comes from a nearby spring and most of the electricity comes from solar panels ."
"It's more serious and darker, a bit like Doctor Who in its last series.
Not everyone was happy with that change, but the team behind Atlantis say they are prepared for any criticism.
""The show is made to work pre-watershed,"" says executive producer and co-creator of Atlantis Johnny Capps.
""I think audiences now are a lot more sophisticated than they used to be.
""Children are exposed to a lot more darker and interesting material than they used to be.
""So I think you have to reflect that in the fact that your audience is more sophisticated.""
He says that thanks to their later time slot of 8.30pm, they're hoping to catch adults and children.
And making the programme darker isn't necessarily a bad thing.
""I think it's a good thing because your showing the complexities of life and emotional stories,"" he says.
""So I think they are richer and I think a family audience will learn more about life, because the shows are darker.
""So they show the light side and the dark side. They show the consequences of emotional stories.""
Jason, who is played by Jack Donnelly, says he was worried about the changes and how they would be received by the audience.
""It's nothing like series one,"" he tells Newsbeat.
""I was chatting with Mark (Addy) and Rob (Emms) about it the other day, and it's not even really a follow-up.
""They've pretty much rebooted the entire series.
""It's a lot darker, a lot more serious, all the episodes are serialised, one leads into the other, leads into the other. [They're] not standalone stories any more.""
But are the team prepared for the backlash?
""Slightly, yes,"" admits Jack.
""I will be honest, Mark, Rob and myself, we were concerned in the beginning because we'd sort of built up a rhythm with each other last year.
""We knew what we were doing, and there was a humour that undercut all the serious moments.
""And we've sort of had to step away from that, under the producer saying, 'You know this is a new direction we are going in.'
""And having seen some of the episodes, just only rough cuts, I would say it might not be suitable for all the younger members of the audience [like] it was last year.
""But I do think overall, the show has improved.
""I think it is a positive thing, where they've taken it. And it just makes it more interesting.
""So for everyone we lose, I'm hoping we're going to gain someone else.""

"Most parents have the souvenir of a scan of their child in the womb at 12 weeks. The must-have for IVF mums and dads these days, however, is a video and pictures right from the moment of conception. The images are thanks to revolutionary technology that allows medics to record the microscopic miracle of life – from fertilisation to the division of cells, right through to the growth of an embryo. Hundreds of parents are now the proud owners of these EmbryoScope images, which are also helping scientists learn more about the IVF process. Scroll down for video . Pictured is the very first cell division of Pixie Morley, now aged nine months, taken using the revolutionary EmbryoScope technology . Sally and Stephen Morley (pictured with their daughter Pixie) are one of some 1,500 couples in Britain who have had babies using EmbryoScope technology . Sally and Stephen Morley are among them. The grainy grey and white picture on this page shows the first cell division in the creation of their IVF baby, Pixie. A tiny camera, placed inside an incubator, films the reproduction process. As well as allowing parents to watch back the moment the embryos form, the technology – developed in the US – also allows experts to select the best possible embryos based on how they form during the conception process. This narrows a mother’s chance of miscarrying. The Morleys, from Walsall, had spent months trying to have children naturally before opting for IVF. Mrs Morley, 38, the head of a nursery, said: ‘I knew time was against me being 36 when we started trying so when I failed to get pregnant each month I knew we should have fertility tests as soon as possible.’ While the couple were undergoing IVF, the EmbryoScope technology was introduced at the Midland Fertility Clinic, allowing them to be the first in their area to capture their child’s conception on camera. The technology allows medics and parents to watch the cell dividing. Pictured is the cell division of now nine-month-old Pixie . In October 2013, the embryo was transferred into Mrs Morley’s womb and within two weeks she was told by doctors that the process had been successful. Now, nine months after Pixie’s birth, she is still able to re-watch the moment her daughter was conceived. Experts have hailed the technology as one of the most important developments in IVF. Professor Simon Fishel, who is boss of Care Fertility, the first clinic in Britain to use the EmbryoScope, said: ‘We now know that embryos that do make babies and embryos that don’t make babies do different things. 'And to be able to see this in a time-matched movie and to be able to analyse it scientifically is absolutely wonderful science for us.’ Professor Fishel, who was part of the team that produced first test-tube baby, Louise Brown, in 1978, said the EmbryoScope was revealing the secrets about what happens to embryos as they develop – and why it is that around 70 per cent of them do not actually make babies. The videos were also an emotional milestone in the process of becoming a parent, Professor Fishel said. ‘The couple can see the process of fertilisation, see the cells divide, see the number of cells grow and see them produce an embryo…it is nothing short of observing the wonderful miracle of life.’ The video given to parents is a sped-up version of the process which occurs before the embryo develops. Professor Fishel said his patients were ‘awestruck’ when given the footage but that the clinic only gave parents the video once a mother had fallen pregnant. He added that, at across the Care Fertility clinics, 1,000 couples, who had gone on to have a baby, had been given footage of their embryo’s development."
"Bomb disposal officers were sent to Birmingham's Lee Bank area on Friday and nearby roads were closed and cordoned off.
The men, two aged 32 and 37 were arrested in Stoke-on-Trent and three others, aged 18, 24 and 28, were arrested in Birmingham.
Magistrates granted police a further seven days to question the men.
Detectives from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit appeared before London's Westminster Magistrates' Court via video link on Saturday to submit their request for a warrant of further detention, a spokesman said.
The men were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.
Ch Supt Sue Southern, from West Midlands Police, said: ""The arrests of the five men were intelligence led and our investigation continues at full pace.""
A number of properties in the Stoke and Birmingham areas have been searched as part of the investigation.
The BBC understands the force was dealing with two suspect devices that were found at a business in Lee Bank on Friday."
"Tents crushed by snow, belongings strewn across the mountainside and a desperate scramble to find any injured victims: this is the chaotic scene after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake sparked an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing 18 people. Before and after images show how the wave of snow, ice and rock flattened the usually serene 18,000-foot-altitude base camp on Saturday. The avalanche started on Mount Kumori, a 23,000-foot-high mountain just a few miles from Everest, and gathered strength as it tore across the world's highest peak. Half an hour after the initial quake, another magnitude-6.6 aftershock hit, followed by smaller aftershocks across the region. Eighteen people died in the avalanche, including four Americans, and 61 were injured, according to Nepal's mountaineering department. Scroll down for videos . Covered: An image, left, shows Everest Base Camp as it usually looks in April compared to how the same place looked following the 7.8-magnitude earthquake on Saturday. Survivors have recalled how they felt themselves being dragged by the wind and snow and emerged to find the camp destroyed . Before the storm: The snow-covered scenes are in start contrast to how the base camp (seen in 2013) usually looks at this time of year . Flattened: But on Saturday, an avalanche pummeled the campers at the 18,000-foot-altitude base camp, leaving it covered with snow . American Google executive Dan Fredinburg, 33, was the first confirmed fatality on the mountain. New Jersey-born Dr Marisa Eve Girawong, 29, was also killed by the avalanche where she worked as a medic for Madison Mountaineering. A third American, Tom Taplin, 61, who owned TET Films & Photography, was making a documentary when the earthquake hit, NBC News reported. His wife Corey Fryer told the station he died 'doing what he loved'. On Sunday the first survivors were flown off Everest by aid helicopters and began sharing their incredible stories of survival. Bhim Bahudar Khatri, a cook for a climbing team, said: 'I was cooking for my team in the meal tent when the earthquake hit. We all rushed out to the open and the next moment a huge wall of snow just piled on me. 'I managed to dig out of what could easily have been my grave. I wiggled and used my hands as claws to dig as much as I could. I was suffocating, I could not breathe. But I knew I had to survive. 'I dug a few more feet until I was out of the snow and could breathe. I looked around and saw the tents all torn, crushed and many people injured. I had lived, but lost many of my friends.' An Everest guide, Pemba Sherpa, 43, added: 'I was resting in my tent when the earthquake hit. I heard a big noise and the next thing I know I was swept away by the snow. I must have been swept almost 200 meters. I lost consciousness. Wreckage: People look over the scene on Saturday after the earthquake triggered the avalanche that flattened parts of the base camp . Deadly: An image from Sunday shows a tent completely flattened by the avalanche, which left 18 people dead on Saturday . Carried to safety: Rescuers use a makeshift stretcher to carry an injured person after the massive avalanche on Saturday . Changed landscape: Another photograph shows the base camp following the huge avalanche on Saturday . Fight for survival: One survivor recalled 'a huge wall of snow' falling on him and how he had to claw his way out to survival . Recovery: A group is seen carrying an injured climber in their sleeping bag; more than 60 people were injured in the incident . Mountaineering instructor Chris Harling, 41, from Keswick, Cumbria, has spoken of the terrifying moment he felt the ground 'turn to jelly under his feet' after the earthquake hit Mount Everest . 'When I regained consciousness, I was in a tent surrounded by foreigners. I did not know what happened or where I was.' He said the toll on Everest was sure to rise: 'There are still many people who are still missing on the mountain. There were several tents buried by the snow, several blown away.' Michael Churton, a filmmaker from New York, was with four other colleagues at the base camp when the earthquake hit, and he said that it took about 45 seconds for the avalanche to finish. 'I told the group to get down,' he said. 'It was about 4,000 feet of snow just coming and there was nowhere to run.' After curling up into a fetal position, he was thrown into a rock, which left him with cuts to his face and a black eye - but he was otherwise uninjured. Mountaineering instructor Chris Harling, 41, from Keswick, Cumbria, has spoken of the terrifying moment he felt the ground 'turn to jelly under his feet' after the earthquake hit Mount Everest. Speaking from his sleeping bag at base camp on the north side of the mountain, the experienced climber said his group took cover after rocks the size of cars came crashing down around them. 'At first we could feel the trembling under the tent, but it was eerie as there was no noise, it was silent. Then it felt like we were shaking on a huge plate of jelly,' he said. 'It was so strange feeling the ground turn to jelly under our feet and we thought the mountain would start crashing down on us.' The instructor from Adventure Peaks, who was leading a group of eight clients on their first trip up the mountain, said the area was badly hit by rock falls, but they all escaped injury. Killed: Three Americans died on the mountain: Dr Marisa Eve Girawong, 29, (left), who was working as a medic at the time, Google exec Dan Fredinburg, 33, (center with his ex-girlfriend, actress Sophia Bush) and documentary filmmaker Tom Taplin, 61 (right) Heading out: Rescuers carry a sherpa injured by the avalanche. The quake is believed to have killed more than 4,000 people . Heading home: A rescue helicopter prepares to land on Sunday and the first survivors were carried off the mountainside . 'Sure enough, an area of steep cliffs did break off sending car sized boulders hurtling down only a few hundred metres from our tents. We are still feeling aftershocks hours later. 'We were very lucky as no one in our group has been injured, but one climber was struck by a boulder.' He said their main priority was now working out how to leave base camp and make their way home, as the road to Kathmandu has been obliterated by the quake. 'We are trapped and have nowhere to go, we can't get back to Kathmandu, the road has been completely destroyed and there is absolutely no way to get through.' Climber Garrett Madison, who runs Seattle-based firm Madison Mountaineering, described how he was leading his group up the mountain when he heard the terrifying sound of avalanches. 'We heard an awful noise and heard avalanches coming down either side of the valley,' he said. 'We thought we were going to get wiped out but we were only dusted by a snow cloud. We proceeded up to Camp Two and contacted Base Camp where we heard of the awful destruction.' On Monday, it emerged that the death toll from the earthquake has risen to 4,400 people, with more than 8,000 injured. The toll is expected to rise as assessments are made in vulnerable mountain villages that have been inaccessible since the quake. Nepalese officials have speculated that the number of casualties could reach as high as 10,000."
"Backlash: Virginia Roberts - pictured here with Prince Andrew - is being sued for defamation . The woman who claimed she slept with Prince Andrew whilst working as a sex slave is facing a legal backlash from two other men she claimed had relations with her, it emerged yesterday. Virginia Roberts is being sued for defamation by high profile US attorney Alan Dershowitz, who said that he wants to have her thrown in jail. Mr Dershowitz said that Miss Roberts would have to give evidence under oath and that if she repeated her claims she will have perjured herself. Miss Roberts has also been branded ‘despicable’ by model agency owner Jean Luc Brunel who said that he is considering legal action of his own. In a statement Mr Brunel said that he was ‘devastated by the unfounded accusations against him’ and wanted to take revenge. Earlier this week Florida Judge Kenneth Marra ordered Miss Roberts’ claims that she was a ‘sex slave’ to billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, a former friend of Andrew, be struck from the record. Amid the other ‘lurid’ allegations removed from the record were claims that she slept with the Duke of York, Mr Dershowitz and Mr Brunel. Mr Dershowitz, who used to represent Epstein, said there was ‘no way’ Miss Roberts could repeat any of the allegations in court ever again. He said: ‘If they try to bring it up in court we’re going to seek contempt proceedings against them. ‘The ultimate goal is for (Miss Roberts) to go to prison for perjury.’ Mr Dershowitz said that last week he tracked Miss Roberts down and served her with a subpoena that she will have to respond to under oath. He said: ‘If she repeats she had sex with me on Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico where I was at for one hour in the presence of five people, she will have committed perjury. ‘If she says I had sex with her on Jeffrey Epstein’s island where I was one day with my wife, my daughter, professor Michael Porter, his wife, and four members of his family, she will be committing perjury’. Defamation: Attorney Alan Dershowitz says he would like to see Ms Roberts in prison after her claims . Mr Brunel has not filed a claim against Miss Roberts yet but said that if she repeats her ‘lies’ again she will ‘end up in prison for perjury’. His lawyer said: ‘He’ll relentlessly sue those who persist in attributing to him any involvement in this sordid sexual scandal to which he is completely foreign’. Miss Roberts had attempted to join a lawsuit filed by two other women who seek to get Epstein’s 2008 plea deal overturned as they feel it was too lenient. In her filing she claimed that she was forced to take part in an orgy with the Duke when she was 17, under the legal age of consent in Florida, and that she slept with him in London, New York and on Epstein’s Caribbean island. Prince Andrew has always strongly denied the allegations against him. Buckingham Palace has confirmed that was informed of Judge Marra’s ruling. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."
"Fresh from Australia's success at Eurovision - when contestant Dami Im came in second - many Australian residents are about to cast a much more important vote on Europe and its future.
Anyone with a British passport who lives Down Under is eligible to participate in the UK's referendum on exiting the EU if they have registered to vote in the past 15 years.
With 1.2 million British nationals in Australia, and 250,000 in New Zealand, both the stay and leave camps are in full campaign mode half a world away from the UK. Southern hemisphere votes have the potential to swing the knife-edge referendum.
Posters supporting both sides have sprouted in areas popular with UK residents. In some locations, such as Perth, up to 15% of the population was born in England.
The referendum vote is optional.  As a result there has been a strong campaign just urging voters to post their ballot slips back from Australia.
""Expat conversations swirl around it,"" says the Guardian's cartoonist David Squires. He is a household name in Britain, even though he migrated to Australia several years ago. ""I'm just overloaded trying to work out the issues and the timing is woeful - the vote comes right after Eurovision, just before the Australian general election - and with all the noise of the US election too.""
He feels that it's odd to have a postal vote when he has essentially left the UK behind. ""I really shouldn't have a vote. I'm an ex-pat who has migrated - almost the opposite as to what the vote is about. It's great for comedy though.""
Some expats have been incorrectly told they need to pay to return their postal vote, which uses the free International Business Reply Service (IBRS).
Post offices have asked for up to A$68 (£32) to courier votes. The UK's Electoral Commission told the BBC in a statement it was working closely with postal operators to correct misunderstandings.
Expats are also closely watching the sterling and the Australian dollar, among the world's most-traded and most-volatile currency pairs. The value of the pound has recently veered between A$1.50 and A$3. At its last meeting the Reserve Bank of Australia deferred changing interest rates ahead of the Brexit vote, calling it a ""near-term risk"" with considerable implications for the Australian dollar.
""Sterling could take a pounding with a Brexit,"" confirms Australian business commentator Ross Greenwood. He has spoken to many business leaders in the UK about the impact of a Brexit.
""Mind you, the pound dropping would make the UK's exports more competitive, giving a boon to UK tourism. Aussies would queue at Kingsford Smith [Sydney's airport] keen to get a cheap trip back,"" he says.
""Hundreds of Australian companies are champing at the bit to get access to Britain. They want a UK Free Trade Agreement on much better terms than Europe.
""Many farmers have been enviously eyeing up their traditional British market for Australian milk, beef and wool. It would build an economic relationship that used to be the cornerstone of the Australian and British partnership.""
However, he thinks Australian banks would be very cautious. ""Australia's NAB had an ill-fated adventure into UK regional banking, losing millions on Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank. Once bitten, they'd fight shy of jumping in feet-first again.""
Although the UK might eye-up Australia, he says, ""Down Under is linked now to Korea, Japan and the US. But make no mistake; a newly independent UK would be welcomed with open arms by trade delegations from Canberra.""
However, Annmarie Elijah, from the ANU Centre for European Studies, urges caution. ""The UK and Australia cannot dig the UK-Australia Trade Agreement [UKATA] out of the bottom drawer, dust it off and carry on.""
Creating a new trade agreement would take time. ""There is no reason to think that Australia would be top of the UK's prospective trade partners.""
Far more British expats live Down Under than elsewhere in the world. Only Spain, with 760,000, and the United States at 600,000 come close. As such they will wield considerable influence over whether the UK stays in the EU.
And Ross Greenwood, whose parents are from the UK, says one other thing might change with a Brexit - the EU passport queues. ""It might also heal the small hurt that Aussies of British parentage feel, when they have to queue in the non-UK, non-EU passport line at Heathrow."""
"The 34-year-old was in intensive care in a Swiss hospital and an MRI scan detected bleeding on the brain.
His mount Boomerang Bob was brought down and fatally injured in the race.
The Injured Jockeys Fund said: ""In due course George will leave the intensive care area to the rehabilitation wing of the Wellington Hospital."""
"The visitors, managed by former Burton boss Gary Rowett, pinned the Brewers back in the opening exchanges.
But Jackson Irvine then tested Blues keeper Adam Legzdins before former Birmingham loan signing Lloyd Dyer put Burton ahead with a superb finish.
Jamie Ward volleyed the second, before skipper Michael Morrison headed Blues' best chance wide from a late corner.
Burton's second victory in nine league games lifts Nigel Clough's side six places to 13th in the Championship, while Birmingham remain fifth after only their third defeat of the season - but their second on successive Fridays.
The home side initially struggled to get out of their own half, creating their first clear chance when former Burton keeper Legzdins used his legs to deny Irvine after former Aston Villa trainee Ward flicked on.
Northern Ireland international Ward then provided the pass for 34-year-old Dyer to run onto, and he gave the Blues keeper no chance with the outside of his left foot.
Ward forced Legzdins to a smart near-post save after outsmarting Ryan Shotton, but benefitted from a marginal offside decision to drive home the second as Burton made it six games unbeaten in matches played on Friday evenings.
Burton Albion boss Nigel Clough told BBC Radio Derby:
""Quite often this season we haven't got what we deserved but tonight we could have won by more than two. That is the next stage for us, to really get the results that our performances deserve.
""Psychologically, it is important for us to try and stay out of the bottom three if we can. It is going to be a battle to do that but nights like tonight undoubtedly help.
""Jamie Ward has made one and scored one. That is what we brought him in for - that little bit of quality. The balance between him and Chris O'Grady is important.
""Chris is working his socks off up there. He is such a great team player and appreciated by everyone in the dressing room.""
Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett told BBC WM:
""We were very poor but Burton thoroughly deserved it. They showed a bit more energy and drive on a difficult evening for us.
""Derby and Sheffield Wednesday have found out the hard way here too. Nigel has got a good side, who play with real forward impetus and quality. They'll turn a lot of teams over here, playing like that.
""For the first 15 or 20 minutes, the game panned out how we wanted and we exploited the spaces. But then they got back into it, worked what we were doing and started to pin us back with their wing-backs.
""After that we didn't play with anywhere near enough quality. We're going to have to be a lot better than that against Aston Villa next week.""

"One in five parents sedates their children before a long road trip, despite fears the medication can cause breathing problems. A national driving survey analysed the travel habits of 3700 Australian families which revealed four in five families use technology to deal with bored children, giving them a hand held computer game, like an iPad, while another 70 per cent said they give their kids treats to sweeten the ride. Almost 20 per cent of NSW families use a more extreme technique, admitting they have used sedatives like the antihistamine Phenergan to knock their kids out so their journey will be more pleasant. One in five NSW families have admitted to sedating their children before taking them on long car trips . The over the counter drug Phenergan is commonly used to treat allergies however it contains a sedative called promethazine which is widely known to cause breathing problems in young children. The medical community claim the sedative Phenergan should not be used on children younger than two years old as side effects like respiratory depression, more commonly known as hypoventilation, can be fatal. Warnings about the use of drugs like Phenergan on children have been around since 2006 when the US Food and Drug Administration found the medication was linked to 22 cases of respiratory depression in infants, seven of which were fatal. Westmead Children's Hospital head of general medicine Joanne Ging told Fairfax that Phenergan is far too unpredictable to use as a sedative on children. The medical community claim the sedative Phenergan should not be used on children younger than two years old as side effects like respiratory depression can be fatal. 'We would never recommend it for children on plane trips, car trips or wherever, because its side effects can trigger the exact opposite effect, including hallucinations. It's a medication that really should only ever be used for allergies.' Family therapist and child psychologist Michael Hawton condemned the trend labelling it 'extraordinary' and 'horrible'. 'The whole idea of heading off on a family holiday is to enjoy time together. There's a big difference between entertaining your children and medically straitjacketing them,' he said. 'The whole idea of heading off on a family holiday is to enjoy time together. There's a big difference between entertaining your children and medically straitjacketing them' Respiratory depression refers to a decrease in a person's ability to inhale a sufficient amount of oxygen and exhale enough carbon dioxide. Simply, the person will have difficulty in breathing. This can cause the person to appear out of breath and often lead to a tightness in the chest. The survey also revealed more than half of parents said they are 'sometimes distracted' by their kids who fight, kick the seat or intentionally interfere with the driver. Around 56 per cent of drivers admitted to turning the music up to drown the children out with a further 64 per cent of parents claiming they have threatened children that they will stop the car and leave the unruly kids behind."

The Alan King-trained seven-year-old, a 16-1 shot, led all the way for the 19-time Champion jockey, who is retiring this season.
Ma Filleule (5-1) was second with 5-2 favourite Don Cossack third.
McCoy said: ""I would love to say it's a relief, but I actually got such a thrill riding him.""
The Northern Irishman did not seem to fancy his chances much pre-race, but trainer King's seven-year-old put in some spectacular leaps on the way round.
""I was actually thinking I wouldn't mind riding the horse in next year's Champion Chase,"" said McCoy after his victory.
""He ran away with me for a mile and a half and I thought he would never keep it up but I was quite happy coming down the hill.""
McCoy's wife Chanelle and several of his family members were waiting in the winner's enclosure to greet him after his victory.
""He wanted that feeling one more time,"" said Chanelle.
""Heading into day three he wanted one more time to ride a winner at Cheltenham, to soak up the atmosphere and not finish his career without one more winner."""
"The poll indicates satisfaction fell from 70% to 58% last year - the largest annual drop since it started in 1983.
The King's Fund think tank sponsored the NHS questions put to more than 1,000 people and said their answers appeared to be a comment on reforms and spending squeezes and not care quality.
The government said the survey contradicted its poll among patients.
The survey formed part of the wider British Social Attitudes Survey, which covers a whole host of policy areas.
When asked what they think of their care, most patients are grateful for their treatment and give the NHS a thumbs up.
This is illustrated by the results of the latest annual patients survey, which reveals nine in 10 would rate their care as good, very good or excellent.
Understandably, ministers have highlighted that research to suggest that all is rosy in the health service.
But that does not mean that the findings of the British Social Attitudes Survey are not important.
They are in effect an emotional stock-take of what the public thinks the present and future holds for the health service.
The NHS - like the rest of the public sector - is facing a tough challenge.
Rising demands and a squeeze on finances means the pressure is on - and this drop in satisfaction suggests the public are worried.
The 1,096 respondents to the health questions were asked ""how satisfied or dissatisfied""  they were with the way in which the National Health Service was run.
The King's Fund released the findings on the NHS as it has taken on responsibility for funding that element of the research after the government pulled out last year.
Prof John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, said the poll was important because it had tracked satisfaction over such a long period of time.
""It is not surprising this has happened when the NHS is facing a well-publicised spending squeeze.
""Nevertheless, it is something of a shock that it has fallen so significantly.
""This will be a concern to the government given it appears to be closely linked with the debate on its NHS reforms.""
The King's Fund said it had reached that conclusion because performance measures, such as waiting times and hospital infection rates, remained low.
When the figures are broken down in more detail they show similar patterns.
Satisfaction fell among supporters of all three main political parties - although unsurprisingly if dropped most among Labour voters.
The falls were similar when England was compared with Scotland and Wales combined.
While the NHS reforms apply only to England, the King's Fund suggested there could be some ""leakage"" into the public consciousness elsewhere.
Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the survey results ""clearly reflect David Cameron's disastrous decision to reorganise the NHS at a time of financial distress. Patients are beginning to see the signs of a service in distress.""
He said A&E waiting times over winter, reports of patients on trolleys in corridors, redundancies, and ""reports of services being restricted"" were ""leading people to feel worried about the future of the NHS"".
And Mike Farrar, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, added: ""These results give us a sharp indication that the public have become worried and confused about what is going on with the NHS.""
But Health Minister Simon Burns said the findings contradicted the government's own research which showed satisfaction rates remained high.
In particular, he highlighted the annual patient survey which showed that 92% of patients said their experience was good, very good or excellent.
""The British Social Attitudes Survey targets the general public rather than targeting people that have actually used the NHS, so responses are influenced by other factors.
""By its nature it is not as accurate a picture as the data from patients."""
"Four Taliban gunmen were killed in the gunfight after an argument on the outskirts of Quetta, a source said.
Another report said Mullah Mansour died but this is unconfirmed. A Taliban spokesman denied the gunfight happened.
Mullah Mansour's appointment prompted splits in the Taliban after its founder Mullah Omar's death emerged in July.
A number of senior Taliban commanders refused to pledge allegiance to him and a faction opposed to him was set up last month under Mullah Mohammad Rasool.

The Taliban source said the firing seemed to be spontaneous rather than planned.
Several other Taliban sources told the BBC that Mullah Mansour and his bodyguards had been at the house of another militant, Abdullah Sarhadi, when fighting broke out.
Sarhadi is a Taliban figure with symbolic importance after spending years in US detention in Guantanamo Bay, reports the BBC's Dawood Azami.
Compared to Mullah Omar, his secretive predecessor, Mullah Mansour has adopted an open approach and has met Taliban commanders regularly to discuss their policy concerns, our correspondent says.
What prompted the shooting in Quetta is unclear.
""During the discussion, some senior people developed differences and they opened fire at each other,"" said a senior Taliban commander, Reuters reports.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid categorically rejected the reports.
""No such incident has happened, because he is in Afghanistan not in the area of Pakistan  they have mentioned. Secondly his security is not weak to allow such an incident,"" he told the BBC Afghan service.
Mullah Omar died in 2013 but his death was only confirmed in July.
News of his death disrupted fledgling peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban.
Some senior Taliban leaders had been suspicious of Mullah Mansour's support for peace talks hosted by neighbouring Pakistan, and accused pro-Pakistani circles of installing him as the new leader.
Since August Mullah Mansour has overseen a series of battlefield victories, including briefly capturing the northern Afghan city of Kunduz - a huge setback for Western-backed Afghan forces.
But the Islamist movement has split into openly warring factions since Mullah Omar died.
Recent reports suggest one of the leaders of the breakaway Taliban faction, Mullah Dadullah, was killed in recent fighting with militants loyal to Mullah Mansour."

"North Korea may already have 20 nuclear warheads - double as many as previously thought, Chinese nuclear experts have warned. The pariah state may also have the capability to produce enough weapons-grade uranium to double its arsenal by next year, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Chinese estimates of Pyongyang's nuclear production, relayed to US nuclear specialists, exceed most previous US forecasts of between 10 to 16 bombs, said the report, which cited people briefed on the matter. Scroll down for video . A North Korean vehicle carrying a missile passes by during a mass military parade in Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square. The pariah state may have as many as 20 nuclear warheads, it has now been suggested . North Korean leader Kim Jong Un addresses Korean People's Army pilots in an undated photo released by the state news agency earlier this month. Under the Kim dynasty North Korea has long used nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip in international relations . Experts at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies earlier this year presented three scenarios for North Korea's nuclear capability, predicting its stockpile of weapons could grow to 50 or even 100 within five years. North Korea has conducted three nuclear detonations, the most recent in February 2013. Asked about the report at a regular press briefing yesterday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said he 'did not have knowledge of the specific situation'. 'We must persevere with denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula, persevere in safeguarding peace and stability, and persevere in resolving the relevant issue through dialogue,' Hong said. Earlier this month, US Admiral William Gortney, commander of the US Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, said the US military believes North Korea has the ability to miniaturise a warhead and mount it on a ballistic missile, although there had been no tests. One such rocket is an intercontinental missile with could theoretically hit California as it is designed to carry a payload of more than 5,000 miles. Kim Jong Un (centre in black) posing with his soldiers on top of snow-covered Mount Paektu in North Korea. The country could have as many as 100 warheads within five years, it has been suggested . Stanford University professor Sigfried Hecker was allowed to visit Pyongyang in 2010 and reported seeing a large uranium-enrichment facility. The Journal quoted him as saying: 'Some eight, nine, or 10 years ago, they had the bomb but not much of a nuclear arsenal. 'I had hoped they wouldn't go in this direction, but that's what happened in the past five years. 'The more they believe they have a fully functional nuclear arsenal and deterrent, the more difficult it's going to be to walk them back from that.' North Korea carried out nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013, and has an extremely active ballistic missile development programme, although expert opinion is split on how much progress it has made, reports Agence France Presse. The Chinese estimate reflects growing concern in Beijing about the nuclear ambitions of its errant ally, and is the latest in a series of expert assessments that suggest Pyongyang is moving faster down the nuclear path than previously thought. Kim Jong Un inspecting the newly built Wonsan Baby Home and Orphanage in a photo released earlier this month. North Korea has conducted three nuclear detonations, the most recent in February 2013 . In 2012, Pyongyang demonstrated its rocket capabilities by sending a satellite into orbit, but it has yet to conduct a test that would show it had mastered the re-entry technology required for an inter-continental ballistic missile. The other key question is how close the North is to being able to miniaturise a nuclear device that could be fitted on the tip of a missile. In a white paper published in January, the South Korean defence ministry said the North had already taken its miniaturisation technology to a 'significant' level. Under the Kim dynasty, represented by current leader Kim Jong Un, North Korea has long used nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip in international relations. Last month the country's ambassador to the UK issued a chilling warning that North Korea would be prepared to use nuclear weapons. In a rare interview, Hyun Hak-bong claimed the secretive state could launch a deadly warhead 'anytime'."

"I cannot see these women but I hear them fighting to reach the mobile phone that belongs to the inmate that I am on the phone with.
Thangavelu Sarojini, a young Tamil woman, says she was tortured by her employer.
""I still have wounds and scars in my hands, neck, legs. They beat me, pinched me and burnt me,"" she says from the Olaya detention camp where hundreds of migrant women from south and southeast Asia are held.
Their crime, they say, was running away from employers to escape physical, sexual or psychological abuse. They are all now classified as illegal immigrants under Saudi law.
""I was not paid for one-and-a-half years, they tried to kill me, then I fled to the embassy,"" Sarojini tells me.
Hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankan women arrive in the Middle East every year and they are a major foreign revenue earner for the island.  But many claim to be ill-treated, tortured, or not paid for the work.
In one notorious case in August 2010, 24 nails were removed from the body of LP Ariyawathie, a 49-year-old Sri Lankan domestic worker in Saudi.  Saudi authorities have pledged to investigate her case but there has been no reported progress in the investigation.
But it is not only physical abuse that forced these hapless women to flee their employers.
Kusuma Nandani, a mother-of-two who has not returned to Sri Lanka since 1993, says she was not paid by her employer for at least 15 years.
She says that she suffered stress and depression because her employers did not allow her to keep in touch with her husband, son and daughter in Sri Lanka.
As Kusuma Nandani cannot read or write, she was was only able to write a few letters - and then only with the help of other Sri Lankans.
One day, she was told by the employer that she would not be paid anymore after she forgot to hand over pocket money to the children before dropping them off at school.
From then, she says she was imprisoned by her employers for more than a decade. Rescued by the Sri Lankan embassy officials in Riyadh in 2009 after a tip-off, she has been a detainee at the camp since then.
Her daughter says she is puzzled as to why the Sri Lankan embassy authorities have not been able to send her mother home even though Kusuma was granted an exit visa some time ago.
WG Mala Mangalika is another maid who fled alleged ill-treatment. She says she was told to work without pay for more than a year because her employer paid a Sri Lankan agency nearly 7,000 riyal ($1,866).
Now she is facing a lawsuit filed by the employer.
""The employer says he has paid to the agency for four years so he would not allow me to go back,"" says Mala Mangalika.
Detention centre inmates say that although Sri Lankan officials helped when they first arrived at the embassy, they are concerned about the delay in sending them back home.
Apart from those in the camp, hundreds more abused maids are currently staying in an embassy hostel.
Their plight is worsened because they become illegal immigrants as soon as they leave their employers, the legal ""sponsor"" for their work permits.
Human Rights Watch (HRW) has long been campaigning for more protection for domestic workers in the Middle East and has called for migrant domestic workers to be included into local labour laws so that they are better protected.
""My legs are still swollen and blackened after I fell from upstairs,"" Mala Senananayake weeps as she grabs the phone from others in the queue in Olaya camp, in Saudi Arabia.
""I have no one in Sri Lanka. My parents are gone, my husband is trying to divorce me, I have only daughter who doesn't know who to approach to get help.""
""Please sir, please help me to go back to Sri Lanka,"" she repeatedly begs me.
The labour officer at the Sri Lankan embassy in Riyadh told the BBC that the files of the detainees at Olaya camp have been transferred to the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLFEB) in Colombo.
But SLFEB head Kingsley Ranawaka did not answer repeated telephone calls to get a response.
In an open letter to the governments of Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Sri Lanka, HRW urged them to  ""ensure a timely and comprehensive response"" to alleged abuse and implement ""systemic reforms to prevent such abuses in future"".
It has urged Saudi Arabia to ""prosecute alleged perpetrators, allow victims to return to their home countries before the trial and seek both criminal penalties and financial compensation"".
It also wants the cancellation of the Kafala system that requires the consent of the employer to repatriate migrant workers.
The BBC has had no response from the media office of the embassy of Saudi Arabia in London."
"The 18-year-old has established himself in the Wycombe team this season, making 17 appearances in League One.
Harris, who has signed a three-and-a-half year contract, won League Two's apprentice of the year award for the 2010-11 season.
""It's a good deal for all parties,"" Wycombe manager Gary Waddock told the club's website.
Cardiff manager Malky Mackay has made signing a winger a priority in the January transfer window.
He has failed in his attempts to prize Craig Noone from Brighton, while a bid for Blackpool's wide man Matt Phillips has also been rejected.
Harris broke the record as Wycombe's youngest player when he made his debut in 2009, aged 16 years and 201 days. That record has subsequently been taken from him by Jordan Ibe in 2011, who was 15 years and 244 days when he featured in a Carling Cup tie.
Striker Ibe, now 16, joined Liverpool earlier in the January transfer window.
Waddock added: ""Like Jordon Ibe recently, we didn't want to stand in the way of Kadeem and the opportunity for him to play at a higher level.
""I've thoroughly enjoyed working with Kadeem during my time at the club and I wish him every success for the future."""

"It is adopting a Cardiff University professor's approach which he says has made the Welsh capital safer than similar sized UK cities.
It works by using information from victims to identify violence hotspots, such as in nightclubs and parks.
The method has already been adopted by Western Cape in South Africa and Milwaukee in the USA.
The man behind it, Professor Jonathan Shepherd of Cardiff University's School of Dentistry, said there was no reason it could not work anywhere in the world.
One of the most significant breakthroughs was the sharing of information and joint action by police, councils and emergency departments to try to curb violence.
Every time someone comes through accident and emergency with any sort of injury where alcohol is a contributory factor the police are informed.
It is claimed that the approach has reduced hospital admissions for violence by 42% in Cardiff, relative to 13 similar cities in Wales and England.
More than 100 hospitals across Wales and England have since copied Cardiff.
""It's very low tech and the basic requirements are that the police and local government and health meet from time to time in an organised way,"" Prof Shepherd said.
""That's not rocket science, so we think this is applicable widely, including poor countries [and] low and middle income countries.
""We would very much like to see this implemented in a country like Nigeria, Uganda or South American countries where there's a lot of violence.
""It's in the World Health Organisation-recommended approach but it's easier said than done.""
Prof Shepherd, who was a surgeon at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales, started his work in 1996 after realising that a great deal of violence which resulted in hospital treatment was not known to the police because victims did not report it.
He also noticed trends in the types of facial injuries he was treating.
Patients were being regularly admitted who had been glassed, and one early success was putting pressure on clubs and city centre pubs to adopt plastic glasses.
The move brought about an immediate decline in facial injuries connected to alcohol.
However, there were continuing problems with drink-related crimes in the city so Prof Shepherd and his violence and society research group continued their innovative approach.
The research group's research into violence, alcohol and late-night safety was recognised with a Queen's Anniversary Prize for excellence in higher education in 2009.
Amsterdam decided to adopt the approach after a delegation from the city, including the chief inspector of the police force, visited Cardiff last year.
Hidde Toet, from the Dutch Consumer Safety Institute and who led the delegation, said after the visit: ""The Cardiff model provides us with an effective method to improve the way we share information and implement preventative measures by police and local government to effectively reduce violence."""
"The eight-page booklet gives advice on who can vote, how to register and a page on each of the lead campaigns.
It is part of a Â£6.4m awareness campaign organised by the Electoral Commission, which includes a TV advert.
People not on the electoral register have until 7 June to apply for a vote in 23 June's referendum.
Around 7.5 million people in Britain are not registered to vote - and a recent survey by the commission suggested that a fifth of survey respondents were either not registered or were unsure if they were registered to vote.
'Consider a proxy'
The commission says its campaign - ""You can't miss it"" - is designed to ""cut through the noise"" that everyone will be hearing about the EU referendum.
It comes a month after the government spent Â£9m distributing a 16-page pro-EU membership leaflet to 27 million UK homes - a move which drew heavy criticism from Leave campaigners.
Alex Robertson, the Electoral Commission's director of communications, says the commission's booklet ""gives everyone the information they need"".
""This is an historic event and we don't want anyone to miss out,"" he said.
""A lot of people won't have voted in a referendum before - or will be unsure what the question is.
""If you aren't already registered to vote, then make sure you do it by the 7 June deadline or you'll miss out on the referendum. It's easy and only takes a few minutes online. Tens of thousands of people are doing it every day.""
The commission is also advising voters to think about where they will be on polling day. Anyone who is likely to be away on Thursday, 23 June should consider applying to vote by post or via a proxy - a trusted person permitted to vote on their behalf.
Glastonbury festival, which clashes with polling day, is encouraging the expected 135,000 or more attendees to register for a postal vote so that they don't miss out. The Electoral Commission has confirmed that there will be no polling stations on the festival site.

"The new Manchester City striker headed the Elephants in front from a right-wing cross by Max Gradel.
Hilal Soudani equalised for Algeria against the run of play early in the second half and then forced goalkeeper Sylvain Gbohouo into a brilliant save.
Gbohouo was rewarded when Bony headed in Yaya Toure's free-kick and Junior Tallo set up Gervinho for a late third.
The margin of victory flattered Ivory Coast in what was an even contest and before former Arsenal striker Gervinho confirmed the result on the break, they had been under pressure from Algeria.
Their defence seemed all over the place at times and semi-final opponents DR Congo will have taken note.
Algeria, in the quarter-finals for the first time since 2010, made the brighter start to the contest and almost went ahead in the ninth minute.
Yacine Brahimi raced into the left-hand side of the penalty area and the Elephants' defence failed to deal with his cross, allowing Soudani to get in a shot which was well held by Gbohouo.
In the 21st minute, Riyad Mahrez volleyed over from close range but then Ivory Coast hit back.
Two minutes later, Gradel floated in a free-kick from the left and Serge Aurier's downward header hit the base of the post and then in the 26th minute they took the lead.
Gradel was again involved as he delivered a testing cross from the right and Bony escaped the defence to head home from eight yards.
Bony shot wide from distance towards the end of the first half before at the other end, Saphir Taider's sharp volley was confidently saved by Gbohouo.
The start of the second half mirrored the start of the first with one team dominating but the other one scoring.
This time Ivory Coast were the team who started on top but a comedy of errors in their defence after a deep cross into their penalty area finally saw the ball fall to Soudani, who fired it home.
That sparked a spell of dominance from the Desert Foxes with Gbohouo twice having to clear his lines before he made an amazing 66th minute save from Soudani's point-blank effort.
The momentum changed and two minutes later Bony restored Ivory Coast's lead when he climbed highest to head Yaya Toure's set-piece inside the near post.
Algeria piled on the pressure in the closing stages but could not find an equaliser and Gervinho finished them off when he passed the ball into the net."
"Most MSPs on the equal opportunities committee endorsed the Marriage and Civil Partnership Bill.
But some members were either not convinced by the bill, or had concerns that it lacked adequate protections.
The legislation still needs to go through three stages of voting at parliament before becoming law.
Under the bill, religious bodies would opt in to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies.
In addition, protection would also be offered to individual celebrants who felt it would go against their faith to carry out gay weddings.
Same-sex couples in Scotland currently have the option to enter into civil partnerships, and the Holyrood government has insisted no part of the religious community would be forced to hold same-sex weddings in churches.
Both the Church of Scotland and Roman Catholic Church are opposed to the proposals.
The convener of the equal opportunities committee, Labour MSP Margaret McCulloch, said: ""All of us on the committee recognise the validity, depth and sincerity of all views submitted to us on what has clearly been an emotive issue.
""While the majority of our committee supports the general principles of this bill, we wholeheartedly support the right of all members of the Scottish Parliament to vote on the bill as a matter of conscience.""
The Bill will now go to the full parliament for consideration.
Tom French, of the Equality Network charity, said backing the Bill would help remove discrimination from law.
""With just days to go before the crucial stage-one vote on the equal marriage Bill, we urge MSPs to stand up for a fairer and more equal Scotland by giving this milestone legislation their full support,"" he said.
""The large majority of people in Scotland believe it's time LGBT people had full equality, including the right to marry the person they love. This Bill will remove discrimination from the law and send out an important message about the kind of country we are.""
But campaign group Scotland for Marriage renewed its call for safeguards in the legislation to protect those opposed to it.
A spokesman said: ""The Scottish government's promise of sufficient safeguards have been shown to be hollow.
""Real safeguards set out in amendments to the legislation are required to protect the rights and civil liberties of the majority of Scots who don't support this law.
""No one who supports the law as it stands should be discriminated against. At home in the workplace and in schools, declaring a belief in traditional marriage should always be permitted and respected.""
In England and Wales, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act was passed into law in July.
It is expected that the first gay and lesbian wedding ceremonies will take place by summer next year when the relevant statutory orders have been put in place.
The act will allow religious organisations to ""opt in"" to offering weddings, with the Church of England and Church in Wales being banned in law from doing so."
"NHS Highland said a midwife-led community maternity unit (CMU) is to be in place at the hospital at the end of this month.
In November last year, the health board had anticipated introducing the change by April.
Maternity services are currently led by consultant obstetricians.
NHS Highland has said the majority of births at Caithness General do not require obstetrics.
The hopsital has no facilities for on-site specialist neonatal paediatric support or adult intensive care.
Complicated pregnancies are to be handled by ""strengthened"" services at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and also close working with the ambulance service, the health board said.
It said it was introducing the CMU sooner than planned for staffing reasons.
Highland councillor Gillian Coghill has told BBC Alba that she was ""surprised"" by the health board's latest announcement on the change to the services.
She said a run-in period of about three months had been expected."
"The trio were returning to a family member's home in Heanor in Derbyshire when they caught the intruder taking some jewellery in June.
The thief has since been jailed for 27 months for burglary.
The three heroes, one from Germany and two from America, tackled the man and pinned him to the ground before police arrived and arrested him.
Peter Mueller, 70, and his friends, aged 78 and 81, were given awards by Derbyshire police on Friday.
Mr Mueller said his friends now call them ""the three musketeers"".
""I was astonished. It was instinct,"" he said.
""I have enjoyed that the British Police make a special day for me. They said 'maybe you are a hero'.""
Chief Constable Mick Creedon said: ""To have them here and give them the award ... is really important."""
"The White Garden, at Kensington Palace, was planted to mark 20 years since Princess Diana died in a car crash.
The Duchess of Cambridge joined the princes on the garden tour.
A spokeswoman for Kensington Palace said: ""The engagement will allow the princes to pay tribute to the life and work of their mother.""
They met representatives from the causes and charities supported by Diana, including the Royal Marsden and Great Ormond Street hospitals, the National Aids Trust, Centrepoint youth homelessness charity and the Leprosy Mission.
Members of the public have been leaving tributes and flowers at the gates of the palace to mark the anniversary of Diana's death.
The Princess of Wales died on 31 August 1997 in Paris, when William, now the Duke of Cambridge, was 15 and his brother was 12.
The garden at their mother's former home has been inspired by memories of her life, style and image, such as her white ""Elvis"" Catherine Walker dress.
The White Garden, as it is known, follows a tradition first established at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent, famous for its own white garden created in the 1930s.
Their Royal Highnesses met gardener Sean Harkin who designed the display and Graham Dillamore who knew the princess when he worked there some 30 years ago.
The garden has been open since spring and will continue into September with white roses, lilies, gladioli and cosmos.
It is the fourth London memorial created in tribute to Diana - the others are the Diana Memorial Playground at Kensington Palace, the Diana Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park, and the Diana Memorial Walk at St James's Palace."
"Rhinos' hooker Matt Parcell crossed to open the scoring with Liam Sutcliffe's score making it 12-0 at half-time.
Parcell's second was added to by Jamie Jones-Buchanan as Wolves made a number of handling errors.
Joel Moon's 15th try in 16 games, Parcell's hat-trick and a Rob Burrow try extended the lead as the hosts kept the Wire scoreless.
Leeds, beaten by leaders Castleford at Magic Weekend, are up to third in Super League and have won five of their past seven games.
The closest Wire came to scoring was when Joe Philbin was held up over the try line, but it was a disjointed performance throughout.
Wolves head coach Tony Smith, who spent three years in charge at Leeds, had seen his side lose their first six games of the Super League season but this was just a second defeat in 10 games.
Wolves won the reverse fixture back in April, with what was their first win of the season at their eighth attempt, but were nilled for the first time since April 2016.
Leeds head coach Brian McDermott:
""It was clinical and the further the game went the better we got.
""But I'm just mindful we're playing a team who aren't where we know they can be. We went through that last year.
""We'll judge it accordingly. I'm really pleased not to have a try scored against us but at the same time we beat a team that is lacking confidence and not as good as they can be.""
On Matt Parcell: ""There's still some improvement in him. I thought Rob Burrow when he went on was very influential as well. He posed a massive threat for us.""
Warrington head coach Tony Smith told BBC Radio Merseyside:
""I'm disappointed. We needed to execute better as we didn't take opportunities when they were there early in the game.
""After that I think we forced a lot of things that weren't the right things and the right time.
""Our kicking game wasn't good enough and we just didn't put them under enough pressure tonight.
""You can't come to Headingley and turn over too much ball or kick poorly as they're a dangerous team.""
Leeds Rhinos: Golding; Briscoe, Watkins, L Sutcliffe, Hall; McGuire, Moon; Singleton, Parcell, Cuthbertson, Ferres, Ward, Jones-Buchanan.
Replacements: Burrow, Baldwinson, Delaney, Mullally.

"The state of Oklahoma has removed protection for gay people who use ride-sharing services Uber and Lyft. Initially, the Oklahoma Transportation Network Company Services Act included language that prohibited the companies from discriminating against customers based on sexual orientation or gender identity. However, Sen. Jason Smalley has revealed he rewrote the bill to eliminate that language and allow private businesses to establish their own policies regarding discrimination. Controversy: Uber drivers in Oklahoma now have a right to refuse gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender customers who use the ride-sharing app . 'I believe if a private business owner wants to serve or not serve an individual, they have that purview right now,' said Smalley, a Republican. The new version of the bill faced fierce criticism from Sen. John Sparks, a Norman Democrat who tried unsuccessfully to amend the measure. He attempted to add requirements that any driver who wishes to discriminate against a customer based on sexual orientation or gender identity must advertise their intent on their vehicle and on the company's website. 'Why should you be able to discriminate?' Sparks said. 'We're talking about a level of civil conduct in the marketplace. Society has figured out that when you enter the marketplace, you should have an expectation of being treated fairly.' Uber and Lyft, among the most popular ridesharing programs, already have policies in place that prohibit discrimination against customers based on sexual orientation or gender identity. 'Uber's policy is to serve every neighborhood, every driver and every person who needs a ride,' company spokeswoman Jennifer Mullin said. Rewritten: Republican Sen. Jason Smalley (pictured) rewrote the bill to give drivers the option to discriminate . The company will continue to enforce its current terms of service, 'which make clear that discrimination in any form is not tolerated and will result in removal from the platform,' she said. Troy Stevenson, executive director of Freedom of Oklahoma, said in a statement that the group does not 'understand why a member of the Oklahoma Legislature wants to remove protections for [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] Oklahomans from a bill that is specific to an industry that already protects them, in their corporate policies. Oklahomans do not believe in discrimination, and it is time for ideological law makers to quit trying to distract from the real problems of our state by attacking the LGBT community.'"
"Lee Gregory could have put the Lions ahead, but shot over from close range.
Visting goalkeeper Jordan Archer made a fine save to deny Elliot Lee before Gregory and Chris Taylor both missed chances at the other end.
Taylor almost sealed three points for Millwall late on but his defected effort hit the post, meaning the Londoners drop to sixth in the table.
They are four points ahead of Barnsley, who have a game in hand, while Colchester remain in 23rd place, still seven points adrift of safety.
Millwall boss Neil Harris told BBC Radio London:

""I don't think we were really quite as clinical as we have been.
""I thought we were very lacklustre in the first half and never really imposed our tempo on the game.
""I think we can focus on the fact that it's a really good clean sheet, it's another point gained.
""Having said that, I'm obviously disappointed. I thought we should have come here and won today."""
"European Space Propulsion (ESP) Limited blamed disappointing sales for going into liquidation.
Formed by Aerojet Rocketdyne in 2012, it operated from missile maker Thales UK's factory in Castlereagh.
Its offices were opened by the former First Minister Peter Robinson.
He had expressed delight the US company had selected Belfast as its European sales base.
But it never got near its projected Â£13m annual turnover.
A spokesman for the firm said: ""We had high hopes, just like the Northern Ireland ministers did.
""We thank them for their support but unfortunately expected sales just never materialised.""
As recently as December, then Economy Minister Jonathan Bell talked of ESP as having ""brought significant benefits to Northern Ireland"".
Employee numbers never got above eight."
"Prison officials must treat an inmate's gender identity condition just as they would treat any other medical or mental health condition, the Justice Department said in a court filing Friday. The Southern Poverty Law Center in February filed a lawsuit against Georgia Department of Corrections officials on behalf of Ashley Diamond, a transgender woman. The lawsuit says prison officials have failed to provide adequate treatment for Diamond's gender dysphoria, a condition that causes a person to experience extreme distress because of a disconnect between the birth sex and gender identity. Prison officials must treat an inmate's gender identity condition just as they would treat any other medical or mental health condition, according to a Justice Department ruling in the case of transgender inmate Ashley Diamond . A photo of Diamond compared to her Department of Corrections mugshot shows the drastic difference without maintaining treatment . The Justice Department filed a brief in the case Friday saying it's not taking a position on the accuracy of Diamond's claims, but reminding prison officials that the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution requires them to provide inmates with individualized assessment and care for the condition. Department of Corrections spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan wrote in an email that the agency doesn't comment on pending litigation. While similar cases have been brought in other courts, Justice Department officials said this is the first time the agency has gotten involved in one of these cases. That action signals this administration's commitment to protecting the interests of transgender people in this context and sends a message to state officials that the federal government has taken a clear position on the substantive legal issues in the case, said Georgia State University law professor Russell Covey. 'If Georgia disagrees, that sort of holds out the possibility of some future legal conflict between the state and the federal government,' he said. 'It's a kind of shot across the bow.' Diamond, who's 36, has identified as female since she was a child and began hormone therapy when she was 17, the lawsuit says. Diamond says she has been subject to ridicule and even sexual assault while behind bars . That gave her full breasts, a feminine shape, softer skin and a feminine appearance. Only inmates identified as transgender during their initial intake screenings are eligible for gender dysphoria treatment under Georgia Department of Corrections policy, but the personnel who do those screenings often aren't familiar with the condition, the lawsuit says. Despite having noticeable feminine physical characteristics and telling department staff she was transgender and receiving hormone therapy, Diamond was not evaluated for gender dysphoria and wasn't referred for treatment and her hormone therapy was halted, the lawsuit says. Though medical personnel subsequently evaluated her and determined she had gender dysphoria and that hormone therapy and female gender expression were medically necessary, department officials refused to authorize the treatment, the lawsuit says. So-called freeze-frame policies, that only allow inmates the level of treatment that they received before imprisonment and that allow no treatment for those who weren't initially classified as suffering from gender dysphoria are unconstitutional, the Justice Department brief says. Such policies violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. Without the hormone treatment for the past three years, Diamond's body has suffered a painful physical transformation back to its masculine state and she has experienced severe mental anguish, the lawsuit says. She has also been subject to ridicule by inmates and prison staff and has been sexually assaulted by inmates because she hasn't been offered safe accommodation, the lawsuit says. Diamond, 36, identifies as a female and has been on hormone therapy since she was 17 . Southern Poverty Law Center staff attorney Chinyere Ezie said in an emailed statement Friday that the Justice Department brief bolsters their arguments. 'Transgender inmates like Ashley have a right to proper medical care,' Ezie said. 'They have a right to protection from violence and abuse and these rights are secured by the U.S. Constitution.' Other courts have ordered hormones, psychotherapy and other treatments for transgender inmates. A federal judge on Thursday ordered California's corrections department to provide a transgender inmate with sex-reassignment surgery, the first time such an operation has been ordered in the state. It was only the second time anywhere in the country that a judge issued an injunction directing a state prison system to provide the surgery, said Ilona Turner, legal director at the Transgender Law Center in Oakland. The previous order in a Massachusetts case was overturned last year and is being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court."
"A senior Islamist party official convicted of crimes against humanity has been executed in Bangladesh. Mohammad Qamaruzzaman was hanged around 10.30pm on Saturday inside a jail in Dhaka. The assistant secretary general of the Jamaat-e-Islami party headed a militia group that collaborated with the Pakistani army in the 1971 independence war and was behind the killing of around 120 unarmed farmers, prosecutors said. Scroll down for video . Senior Islamist party official Mohammad Qamaruzzaman was convicted of crimes against humanity and has been executed in Bangladesh. Above, Bangladeshi security personnel escort an ambulance leaving Central Jail carrying his body . But the move has been slammed by the man’s supporters, who have called for a nationwide general strike. His execution took place after he refused to seek presidential clemency. The country’s Supreme Court rejected his final legal appeal against the death sentence, which he received in May 2013. Members of Qamaruzzaman's family visited him yesterday afternoon for the last time, his lawyer Shishir Manir said. Shortly after TV footage showed an ambulance, thought to be carrying Qamaruzzman's body, leaving the jail under police escort. In a statement Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh's largest Islamist political party, denounced the execution and called for a protest against the government's action. A Geneva-based UN High Commissioner for Human Rights urged officials not to carry out the execution, claiming that Qamaruzzman's trial did not meet ‘fair international’ standards. His execution took place after he refused to seek presidential clemency. The country’s Supreme Court rejected his final legal appeal against the death sentence, which he received in May 2013 . Bangladeshi security personnel stand guard outside Central Jail. In a statement Jamaat-e-Islami, the country's largest Islamist political party, denounced the execution and called for a protest against the government's action . A spokesman from the U.S. State Department added: ‘We have seen progress, but still believe that further improvements… could ensure these proceedings meet domestic and international obligations.’ Bangladesh blames Pakistani soldiers and local collaborators for the deaths of 3million people during the nine-month war seeking independence from Pakistan more than 40 years ago. An estimated 200,000 women were raped and around 10million people were forced to take shelter in refugee camps in neighbouring India."
"A fire was started when the building was broken into sometime between Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning.
The museum is located in the Bogside, close to where some of the 14 victims of Bloody Sunday were killed in 1972.
John Kelly, whose brother, Michael, was killed said the damage to the building could have been a lot worse.
""I looked at it and thought: ""Good God, if that had really caught fire, we could have had an explosion"".
A Â£2.4m reconstruction of the Glenfada Park museum began in 2015 and is now close to completion.
Mr Kelly has been working on the project for the past 10 years.
""It shows total disrespect for my brother and all those who died during Bloody Sunday and all the others who lost their lives in that period of time, total disrespect for our family members and their memory,"" he said.
""The police told me there was a fire and it was in the back store, that's where we have the gas mains and electronic equipment as well.
""The building is next door to people's houses and everyone could have been affected by it. It didn't travel any further, thank God, and we still have an intact building,"" Mr Kelly added.
Building site foreman Dermott McGrotty said they have now improved security at the site.
""They had to climb over an eight foot fence to get in, so overnight security has now been arranged and we're making sure the doors are well secured.""
The Northern Ireland Fire Service is treating the fire as deliberate. The police have appealed for information."
"He held off a late charge by Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo in a nail-biting climax and leads his team-mate by eight points after Hamilton took third.
Mercedes' decision to switch Hamilton to a three-stop strategy got him back ahead of Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen.
When Ricciardo followed suit, he closed rapidly on Rosberg, who just held on.
Australian Ricciardo rejoined just under 30 seconds adrift, with 16 laps remaining, and initially sliced into Rosberg's advantage at nearly three seconds a lap.
But as the laps ticked by the advantage of Ricciardo's fresh tyres began to fade and the edge was taken off his charge.
Rosberg had just enough pace, despite managing fading brakes, to keep the Red Bull at bay, crossing the line just 0.488 seconds ahead for a win that could prove crucial in the destiny of the world title.
Listen as Rosberg holds off Ricciardo to win Singapore GP
Hamilton had an out-of-sorts weekend, qualifying only third, 0.7 seconds slower than Rosberg, lacking grip after failing to set up his car properly because of track time lost to a hydraulic failure in Friday practice.
He drove a steady race, unable to do anything about Rosberg and Ricciardo ahead of him, and intermittently pleading with his engineers to come up with a strategy that could gain him places.
Both Mercedes drivers were struggling with overheating brakes and Hamilton struggled so much that he was caught by Raikkonen in the second stint, and actually lost third place following a mistake at Turn Seven just after half distance.
Listen as Raikkonen passes Hamilton for third
Raikkonen made his second stop at the end of the lap, Hamilton a lap later, and the world champion rejoined still in fourth place.
At this point, Mercedes decided to switch Hamilton's strategy and unleashed him from managing his tyres and told him to close on Raikkonen.
Hamilton's final pit stop on lap 45 triggered his rivals to follow suit, with Raikkonen pitting on the following lap and Ricciardo the lap after that.
The move worked for Mercedes - it leapfrogged Hamilton back ahead of Raikkonen and despite being on super-soft tyres rather than the ultra-softs chosen by Ferrari, Hamilton was comfortably able to hold on to the final podium place.
Behind the top four, McLaren's Fernando Alonso ran fifth from the start of the race after a quick getaway. It took him down the outside as Force India's Nico Hulkenberg and Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz collided, and he passed Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat into the first corner.
Alonso held on to the place through the subsequent safety car period and the first and second stops, fending off heavy pressure from Sainz's team-mate Daniil Kvyat and Verstappen.
Around mid-distance, Alonso got some breathing space thanks to an intense battle between Kvyat and Verstappen.
Listen to Hulkenberg's crash at the start
The fight had added needle because of the Russian's demotion in Verstappen's favour after four races this season and after Kvyat had squeezed Verstappen close to the wall on a couple of occasions to keep him behind, the Dutchman complained over team radio.
In the end, Red Bull pitted Verstappen to give him some clear air to exploit his pace - a decision that ultimately won him sixth place.
But as the race progressed and strategies diverged, Alonso was passed by Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, recovering strongly from a start at the back of the grid following a suspension failure in qualifying, and found himself defending from Verstappen, who was on fresher tyres, in the closing laps.
The extra grip from the rubber and the superiority of the Red Bull car meant Verstappen could pull off an aggressive dive down the inside of Turn Seven with a handful of laps to go.
Alonso had to be satisfied with seventh, behind Vettel and Verstappen, a strong performance at the end of a difficult weekend for McLaren.
Jenson Button retired at two-thirds distance after an early pit stop to replace a damaged front wing and spending much of his time struggling with poor grip at the back of the field.

"A football fan is facing a three-year ban after running topless onto a pitch and performing a series of somersaults during his first ever game at the stadium. Charlie Sumner, 20, staged a one-man pitch invasion at Reading's Madejski Stadium during the team's FA cup quarter final replay with Bradford City last month. The Reading supporter, whose team were 3-0 up at the time, did four front flips on the pitch, landing on his back each time, before being tackled by stewards. Charlie Sumner, 20, staged a one-man pitch invasion at Reading's Madejski Stadium during their quarter final replay with Bradford City last month (pictured) The Reading supporter, whose team were 3-0 up at the time, did four front flips on the pitch, landing on his back each time . Sumner - who said going to his first game was a 'brilliant experience - is now facing a potential three-year ban for carrying out the stunt. The order, due to be decided on April 30, would stop him going to all Reading's future home and away matches. Today, Sumner, from Wokingham, Berkshire, said he has no regrets about the incident, saying that he had done it for 'laugh' and that his family had 'seen the funny side'. Speaking outside court, he said: 'After doing it and seeing good comments and messages, even from the away fans, I don't look back and regret it. 'Obviously I wouldn't inform other people to do it. It was just spur of the moment. It's good to see good feedback and not negative feedback. 'I'd had a few drinks, I was happy and Reading were winning and I just went for it and had a laugh. It was brilliant.' Asked whether he goes to many Reading matches, he added: 'That was my first game actually. It was a good experience. Obviously being there on the first game - not after what I've done, but standing in the stadium, watching the game from the stadium - it's a brilliant experience. 'Obviously with the ban, I wouldn't be able to experience that experience again.' Charlie Sumner, pictured outside Reading Magistrates' Court today. He is facing a potential banning order . After running onto the pitch, Sumner was tackled by stewards. The footage of Sumner's antics went viral . The incident took place on March 16, when the match was being broadcast live to millions of viewers on BBC One. Afterwards, footage of Sumner's antics also went viral on the internet. Sumner, who went to the match with a group of eight friends, said he talked with his friends in a taxi on the way to the match about potentially running on to the pitch. 'I did say no at first. Then Reading were winning and I got a bit excited,' he said. 'I went to rave on Friday and there's another video on Facebook and I'm doing flips there. I've had a few selfies, a few drinks bought for me.' Sumner said he spoke to friends on the way to the stadium about carrying out the stunt. He said he had no regrets and that his family had seen 'the funny side' But Sumner, who works as a dry liner fixing ceilings, said he thought a potential football banning order 'seemed a bit much.' 'I don't want a three year ban because obviously it's quite a bit,' he said. 'I'm not encouraging people do it and if I go to another game, I'm not going to do it again.' At today's hearing, Sumner's solicitor entered a guilty plea on his client's behalf to one count of going on to a playing area at a football match under the Football Offences Act 1991. Sumner, who was at court but missed his hearing after leaving the building briefly, was released on bail with conditions that he does not attend Reading's home or away matches. He will appear at Reading Magistrates' Court on April 30 when a decision will be made on whether he receives a football banning order."
"A white German Shepard puppy named Lt.Dan from South Carolina born without his paw now has a new friend who understands his unique struggle. On Monday the nine-week-old puppy was given to three-year-old Sapphyre Johnson who is missing both of her feet. 'He's just like me!,' the toddler exclaimed with joy the first time she ever saw a photo of Lt. Dan. The dog's original owner Karen Riddle said that Lt. Dan, who was born with eight other puppies in a litter - and could have been euthanized. Missing their feet: Of the nine pups in the litter, Lt. Dan, named for the character in Forest Gump who lost his legs, was the only one missing a paw and Sapphyre Johnson had to have her feet amputated . On Monday, the nine-week-old puppy Lt. Dan without a paw found a new home with Sapphyre Johnson, a toddler who lost both of her feet . Just like me!: Sapphyre and Lt. Dan made fast friends on Monday and the two will grow up together at Sapphyre's family's home in Tennesee . Greenville Online reports that the puppy was named after a character in the film Forest Gump who lost both of his legs. Fellow breeders suggested to Riddle when Lt. Dan was born that he should be put down because he might be too sick to live. But Riddle didn't buy it. When the hound grew a little, Riddle was determined to find a home for him with someone with special needs. Because her father was a Shriner she called Shriners Hospital to see if there was a special needs child or wounded veteran who might want a pet in their home. Sapphyre, who is from Tennessee, has been in the hospital ever since she was just three-months-old. 'When I was seven months pregnant, they did an ultra sound and told us she may be missing some fingers and toes,' said Sapphyre’s mother, Ashley Johnson. 'They don't know what caused it,' she said. Different: Lt.Dan was the only one out of nine puppies who was born without a paw and fellow breeders suggested to his original owner that he be put down . Brilliant Idea: Rather than kill Lt. Dan because he was different, his original owner Karen Riddle suggested that he be placed in a home with a wounded veteran or special needs child . Playing and learning: 'In the future, I could see Sapphyre at her first show-and-tell in school and she could bring in her dog and explain about her dog and herself,' said an employee at Shriners Hospital . Shriners gives prosthetics and orthopedic services to children under 18 no matter what their family's income is. 'She had just two really long toes on each foot. And when she was 1, we had them amputated so she could be fitted for prosthetics,' said Sapphyre's mother. Shriners even suggested prosthetic leg could be made for Lt.Dan when he grows large enough. When Sapphyre saw a picture of her new puppy she knew that she had to have him and she felt an instant connection. 'The first time I showed her a picture of the dog, she looked at it for a moment, and she said, ""That's my puppy. He's just like me,"" ' said Elaine Hardin who works at Shriners. Best friends: Sapphyre and Lt. Dan only just met but from the looks of it they are already best friends . 'He's a special dog and he's going to a special child.' Hardin told Greenville Online that the dog will help Sapphyre make friends and will also help her to explain her disability to other kids. 'In the future, I could see Sapphyre at her first show-and-tell in school and she could bring in her dog and explain about her dog and herself,' Hardin said.

"Breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic 'markers' Breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic 'markers' in the tumour and determine its aggressiveness. After surgery, the cancer cells are sent to a lab where they are screened, and women can be told within days whether they have a high or low risk of the disease returning. For some women, the test can accurately tell if the risk is as low as five per cent, which is as good as if not better than the odds for those who have chemotherapy. The majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence. Although the medication kills off cancer cells, the side effects – including complete hair loss, nausea, sickness, weight gain or loss, and extreme fatigue – can be difficult to live with. For some women, the prospect of chemotherapy is more daunting than the surgery itself. But experts have long-believed that the risk of cancer recurrence for certain women is a lot less than for others, and that for some, chemotherapy may not be necessary. If the newest of the tests, called EndoPredict, shows a low score, patients can opt not to have chemotherapy. Most of the tests are available only privately and cost about £2,500, although breast specialists hope they may soon become properly available on the NHS. Surgeon Hemant Singhal said: 'I think there is a good case for the NHS to use this test on the basis that the cost is balanced out by savings in not giving chemotherapy.' Professor Kefah Mokbel, consultant breast surgeon at St George's Hospital, London, said: 'With this test we can help patients make an informed choice, whereas in the past we have just given chemotherapy to almost everyone.' Becca Cornford, a 49-year-old mother of three aged 11, six and four, was recovering from being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer last year only to then discover that she had cancer in her other breast. The majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence . She said: 'I dreaded chemo more than another mastectomy. I was worried it would interfere with me being able to look after my children.' Professor Mokbel operated on Becca in December at the Princess Grace Hospital, London, and afterwards a sample of her tumour was sent away and tested using the EndoPredict. A low score meant her chances of recurrence within ten years were just five per cent and she was told chemotherapy could not offer much better odds. 'I could have gone through chemo and the cancer could still return,' she says. 'There is no treatment that places your chances at zero. But if you have regular monitoring, there is every chance that any cancer that might come back would be nipped in the bud early.'"
"The outlines of a nuclear deal with Iran are in place. Unfortunately, it seems like too many in President Barack Obama's administration have forgotten that the only reason this terrorist-supporting state came to the negotiating table in the first place was because of tough sanctions imposed by the U.S. Congress. Indeed, the reality is that President Obama is giving up enormous leverage in his nuclear deal with Iran -- and I worry we will lose it for good. Bleeding money, and faced with falling oil prices, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei gave his government rare permission to bargain with the ""Great Satan"" -- the United States. But just as U.S. and European sanctions were forcing Iran to the nuclear crossroads, President Obama has given Tehran an easy exit. For Khamenei, the ""framework"" announced last week looks like a win-win: He gets to keep his nuclear infrastructure, and in return gets billions of dollars in sanctions relief. Congress offered a better strategy when the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, and I introduced a bill to hit Tehran with its toughest sanctions yet. Unfortunately, this bill -- which passed the House in a 400-20 vote -- was blocked in the Senate last year, despite the fact that it would have sharpened the Ayatollah's choice: Dismantle your nuclear weapons program or see your economy collapse. President Obama once had a tougher line, when in 2012 he said: ""The deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program. It's very straightforward."" But the framework announced last week does nothing of the sort. Negotiated between Iran and the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany, the framework concedes that Iran can maintain ""a mutually defined enrichment program,"" operate thousands of centrifuges, and continue its research and development of nuclear technologies. The deal currently on the table would hand Tehran billions of previously sanctioned funds, filling the coffers of the world's biggest state sponsor of terrorism, with strongholds in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon. Meanwhile, the strictest restrictions on Iran's enrichment will expire in only 10 years, despite the President receiving a letter from 367 Members of Congress -- both Democrats and Republicans -- in which we insisted that ""verifiable constraints on Iran's nuclear program must last for decades."" The President admitted as much when he conceded that ""in year 13, 14, 15, they have advanced centrifuges that enrich uranium fairly rapidly, and at that point the breakout times would have shrunk almost down to zero."" But as bad as these concessions are, the most concerning aspect of the April 2 deal is that it lacks tough safeguards to stop Iran from cheating. The key question is this: Will the inspectors at the International Atomic Energy Agency be allowed to inspect these military sites without warning? Because if the IAEA cannot conduct ""anytime, anywhere"" inspections, Iran will be able to ""sneak out"" to a bomb. It has been done before. Remember, in 1994, when President Bill Clinton told us he had struck a deal with North Korea that would ""make the United States, the Korean Peninsula, and the world safer""? President Clinton sounded a little too much like the current Secretary of State John Kerry, when he promised that the North Korea agreement ""does not rely on trust"" and that ""compliance will be certified by the International Atomic Energy Agency."" Twelve years after these assurances, North Korea detonated its first nuclear bomb. Iran could easily do the same. The best predictor of its future behavior is its past behavior -- between 2004 and 2009, the Iranian government built a huge centrifuge facility named Fordo under a mountain deep in the Iranian desert. Luckily for the world, Western intelligence agencies discovered Tehran's deception. But we cannot rely on such luck in the future, particularly when Iran still hasn't come clean about its history of secret weapons development and is still dodging basic questions from the IAEA. Let's not forget the other things Iran has been doing while its diplomats have been bargaining with the U.S. and its partners. While Iran was showing its friendly new face to the world, it has simultaneously been helping Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad kill his own people, training and funding the terrorist group Hezbollah, which aims to annihilate Israel, and supporting the Houthis, who started a civil war and overthrew the government in Yemen -- one of America's more reliable counterterrorism partners in the region. If President Obama is going to hand over billions of dollars to a regime that behaves like this, run by a man who publicly declares: ""Death to America,"" it has to be a better deal. The framework we have before us keeps Iran's nuclear door well and truly open."
"Players' chief Gordon Taylor insists Raheem Sterling is not being disloyal to Liverpool by putting any further talks about a new contract on hold until the summer.

Taylor said: 'I don't think it's meant to be a sign of disloyalty to Liverpool. 'Even Steven Gerrard, a Liverpool man all his career, had to think about his situation from time to time when there was a great deal of interest in him from other clubs. 'As a player with two years left on his contract he's obviously entitled to consider his options. 'It is a little bit untidy however when the negotiating is taking place in the full glare of the media. 'It's the nature of the game now and it is not necessarily a bad thing for both the club and the player to concentrate on football and leave things on the contract until the end of the season. Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal and leading clubs in Spain . Sterling scored for England in their Euro 2016 qualifier with Lithuania on Friday evening . 'They will want to focus on the run-in, the race for the top four and the Champions League places, and the FA Cup as well, and sometimes contract negotiations are the last thing you want to be worrying about.' Taylor added that he was confident Sterling was aware of what he owed to Liverpool and Rodgers. He said: 'Raheem has got to feel very close to Liverpool and he will be aware that they have looked after him, that the manager Brendan Rodgers has put his faith in him and given him his opportunity.'"

"Mohamed Diame will make his long-awaited return for Hull when the Tigers travel to Swansea on Saturday. Hull boss Steve Bruce has confirmed that the Sengalese midfielder, signed for £3.5million from West Ham in the summer but who has been out for more than four months with a knee injury, will be involved at some stage of the match. Bruce said: 'He will be involved. Physically he's immense, he's terrific, but he has been out for four months with a horrible injury. Mohamed Diame is set to return from injury for Hull City's visit to Swansea City on Saturday . The return of the £3.5m Senegalese midfielder is a boost for Hull as they face a relegation battle .

I would have loved to have had him back before but it was not possible.' The 27-year-old French-born midfielder's return could not be more timely for Hull as they look to secure their Premier League status for another season, and defender James Chester is also available again after a dislocated shoulder. Bruce admitted that Hull, currently 15th in the table, have a tough run-in - what he referred to as 'the tickly bit' of the season - but insists the side are in good form. He added: 'In the last few weeks we have played well but we have not got the results we hoped for. Now we have to make sure we turn those performances into points.' Manager Steve Bruce is pleased to have Diame back as Hull enter the 'tricky bit of the season' Owner Assem Allam has again applied to the Football Associations that the team's name become Hull Tigers . Bruce added that he hoped the ongoing debate over the proposed name change for the club can be put to one side for the rest of the season - an arbitration panel has ruled that owner Assem Allam can make another application to change the name to Hull Tigers after it was initially refused by the FA council who took into account opposition from fans' groups. 'For what he has done for the club, putting it on the map and putting in his hard-earned money, the owner is entitled to have an opinion,' said Bruce. 'Hopefully there's a middle ground but at the moment I hope it can be put to one side and we make sure that Hull City/Hull Tigers are in the Premier League next season and we can have that debate in the summer.'"

"They say the government is failing to promote back-to-nature schemes which protect lowland homes by deliberately creating floods in the hills.
The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM) say upland schemes to slow river flow cost a fraction of conventional flood walls – and should be spread round the UK.
Ministers back the principle but say the details need to be worked out.
The idea of creating floods upstream to prevent floods downstream was a key message from the Pitt Review into the 2007 floods.
A handful of pilot projects have pioneered cheap small-scale measures like felling trees into streams to slow down the flow, and building earth banks to catch run-off water and allow it to soak away.
One low-tech scheme in the hills above Belford in Northumberland cost about £300,000. It was put in place after a study suggested the cost of conventional flood defences would cost £4m.
But progress nationally has been slow, with funding a major problem.
Katherine Pygott, from CIWEM, told the BBC: “Flooding is getting worse with changing weather patterns, but these schemes are taking a very long time and a lot of energy.
“Projects working with nature to reduce flood risk are needed right across the country but it is complicated with many different organisations involved and it will need political leadership from the highest level to make it happen. So far we haven’t seen that leadership.”
The upland schemes are designed to reduce the regularity of flooding, not remove risk completely. Conventional flood defences will still be needed but CIWEM estimates that re-wilding rivers will save ten of millions by reducing the peak flow and lowering the specification for flood walls. The projects should also benefit wildlife.
Phil Welton, from the Environment Agency, says the UK should aspire to have ""a pond in every field in the areas where flood prevention is needed.
""We have got to give incentives to farmers to persuade them to capture water on their land,"" he argues. ""Farmers will lose a bit of land – but these areas are only wet for two to three days a year and quite often they are on bits of land that farmers don't use – boggy areas or buffer strips.”
Incentives for farmers are one key sticking point. In theory, funds from the Common Agricultural Policy can be used for catchment management but in practice Ms Pygott says that the standard of proof is much higher than for biodiversity projects which can also be supported under the CAP.
“With biodiversity schemes a farmer simply has to show that he has changed the land in a way that’s expected to benefit wildlife,"" she adds. ""With flood schemes they have to prove what the benefits will be and that’s very hard.
""We obviously don’t want to be wasting government money on the wrong projects but with weather patterns changing it really makes sense to take a leap of faith on this and say it’s obvious these schemes are going to help if you get them in the right place.”
While farmers’ union NFU supports the idea in principle, it maintains it is not a ""panacea"" and will not alleviate flood risk in all parts of the country.
""It is most beneficial in steeper catchments where rainfall is quickly funnelled into rivers that can result in high peaks in flows,"" its flood adviser Ian Moodie warned. “The measures are less likely to be beneficial within lowland areas such as the Somerset Levels where we’ve seen a lot of flooding in recent years.”
Taking the pilot schemes into upland areas nationwide will not be easy. CIWEM say thousands of farms need to be visited and surveyed to see where micro-schemes can be placed to protect catchments – a tough demand when Defra and the Environment Agency are shedding staff.
Environment Secretary Owen Paterson told the BBC he was ""passionate about keeping water in the uplands but details of how to do this need to be resolved"".
CIWEM say the quickest results for back-to-nature drainage will come in areas where land is owned by a few people.
For instance, near Pickering in Yorkshire, flood zones are being created and moorland drains stuffed with heather with the co-operation of just three large landowners including the Forestry Commission.
It was the need for forestry and farm output which saw the UK’s uplands drained in the first place when the farm department MAFF urged landowners to maximize productivity to overcome the U-boats during the Second World War.
Nearly seven decades later there’s still no concerted nationwide attempt to keep the rain on the uplands where it falls.

Amanda's housing expertise have been showcased on her years of presenting A Place In The Sun and now she is at hand to offer advice on how to perk up a house this Spring. Scroll down for video . Amanda Lamb stars in the new Air Wick fragrance campaign as she poses in lush flower arrangements . However, rather than knocking through walls or re-tiling the floor, Amanda says that it is simple touches that can enhance a home. 'You don't need to take drastic measures to make your house more homely. One of the quickest – and smartest – ways to transform your home is with fragrance.' The images behind the campaign take inspiration from scent. The seductive shoot has been captured by Vogue and GQ photographer, Willy Camden. The TV presenter offers advice on how to spruce up a home this spring . Amanda says that one of the easiest ways to instantly perk up a room is with a home fragrance . Willy's style is vibrant and colourful – in-keeping with the Air Wick Life Scents campaign. Amanda opts for floral scents when it comes to brightening up her own home. 'My favourite fragrance in the range is Summer Delights – it's my household hero,' she said. 'You get three constantly changing scents of white flowers, melon and vanilla orchid, so when I walk in the door, it never smells the same.'

"They’ve won seven on the spin in the Premier League and made Liverpool look like relegation candidates as opposed to Champions League rivals during Saturday’s first-half slaughter. So why are Arsenal destined to sign off from another campaign celebrating a top-four finish and not a serious title challenge? Finish second they may well, but never have they entered the race for the top-flight crown. This term they are simply the best of the ragged rest, each with their flaws which have made the title tussle something of a ‘no contest’. Arsenal celebrate after a fine strike from Alexis Sanchez put them 3-0 up against Liverpool on Saturday . This is the most impressive team the Gunners have boasted since the dying embers of the Invincibles side of more than a decade ago. They have pace, power, energy and invention in attack – and that is just Alexis Sanchez. At the other end they have hit upon an understanding which has seen them not concede more than once in the league since New Year’s Day. But their failure to marry all of those components over the course of an entire campaign has cost them, again. This year, however, is a reverse of previous seasons. More recently we have built up Arsene Wenger’s side as title challengers until the arrival of spring, only for it all to fall flat. Arsene Wenger watches on as his side cruise to a stylish win over their rivals for a top-four spot . This time, it is a stuttering start which has undermined their progress. By mid-October they had already dropped 13 points. There was talk of Wenger not even seeing the season out, let alone extending his stay into next term and beyond. But is the long-serving Frenchman finally about to hit upon a team which, given the manner in which they’re finishing this campaign, could well be installed as title favourites come August? Should Wenger strengthen in key areas then they would surely be vying for such status at the head of the market. He needs no more Mesut Ozils, no more Santi Cazorlas or Tomas Rosickys. Rather, he needs a new spine and characters with backbone. Mesut Ozil celebrates his goal on Saturday as the German World Cup winner continued his fine form . A central defender, central midfielder and centre forward need to arrive if this current vintage is to avoid going the same way as those who have promised so much yet delivered so little in recent years. Interestingly, Wenger’s policy of chasing the best British talent could be on the way out. Yes, there was the capture of Danny Welbeck last summer, but that was more opportunistic than a long-term pursuit. Welbeck, in turn, has netted just four league goals and watched from the bench as Liverpool were torn apart. So, too, did Theo Walcott. He has the mitigation of injury, of course, but does Wenger trust him to remain fit for an entire campaign? Likewise, Jack Wilshere. Teams which win titles have players who, in short, play. Jack Wilshere (centre) watches on from the stands on Saturday after missing out through injury . Theo Walcott (left) has struggled since returning from a year-long injury lay-off . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Aaron Ramsey have both started just 17 of 31 league games. For the latter, a return of four goals is a sorry show given the 16 he plundered last season. So while there is the promise of better times ahead, issues remain for Wenger to sort. You feel he is finally on the cusp of something exciting at the Emirates. But then we have been there before and it ultimately ends in the celebration of failure. Wenger needs to think big this summer, or else goodwill from frustrated fans could be in short supply."
"When these villagers in China spent £1,000 and hours of hard labour digging a new well, the least they expected was some fresh drinking water. But they were left disappointed after pumping the liquid to the surface, only to discover it was so polluted that they could set it on fire. Residents of Ansai, in Shaanxi Province, central China, said they could smell gas and petrol coming from the well, and blame a leak from a local petrol station, The People's Daily Online reports. Villagers in Ansai, Shaanxi Province, in central China, dug a 46m well in order to get fresh drinking water, but when the pumped it to the surface the found it was so polluted it could be set on fire . Local officials say they have now launched an investigation into how the water from the well, which cost £1,000 to build, became so polluted . Locals said they could smell  petrol when the water surfaced, and blame the pollution on a leak from a local gas petrol station, a claim which the owner denies . However, when Chinese officials investigated, they said they could find no trace of a spillage, leading some people to theorise that the villagers could have struck oil. However this is highly unlikely, as oil deposits only occur between 750 and 4,500m underground, and the well is only 46m deep. Tuo Zhijun, a villager in Ansai, said: 'Who knew when we turned on the pump, once the water was seeping through, everyone could smell gas and see oil slick.' Some locals have suggested that the lucky villager may have struck oil, but this is highly unlikely, as oil deposits typically occur between 750 and 4,5000m underground, and the well is only 46m deep . After drawing the first fresh water out of their new well, the villagers discovered they were able to set it on fire because it was so polluted . Local officials do not yet know exactly what substance is in the water, though they say they are conducting a specific investigation to discover the cause . ‘We suspect that there was an oil leak from a petrol station not far from here.’ However, Li Jianhua, the manager of the petrol station, refuted these claims, saying: ‘The authorities have already examined the place and nothing was wrong. 'There has not been any problems with the well in the petrol station either.' Local government officials in Ansai say they have already started a specific investigation. Intrigued locals take pictures of the flaming water near the site of the new well in Ansai, central China ."

Saurage later reported that the gator was safely hauled out of the pond, although it took a bit of work as it was being particularly 'aggressive'. Art Williams, of Groves, was the one who spotted the gator in his garden over Easter weekend. 'My wife and I are just going for a walk, with our new dog, and there's that 11 foot alligator just about 12 feet from us,' Williams told KBMT News. Williams said he's used to alligators being in the area, which is why he built a fence to keep them away from the pond where his grandchildren canoe.

He says there's no reason for people to fear the toothy lizards, as long as they keep a safe distance and never attempt to feed them. He points out that alligators can run 22 miles per hour on land and 'you can't run that fast.' Although it was big, Monday's catch wasn't Saurage's biggest.

Police ignored the sexual abuse of hundreds of young girls because they were too busy chasing Labour crime targets that would earn bonuses for senior staff (picture posed by model) It meant that, while young girls suffered heinous abuse at the hands of sex gangs in Sheffield and Rotherham, top brass could have had a perverse incentive to instruct their staff to look elsewhere. The targets have been scrapped by the Tories amid concern they were harming policing. Tory parliamentary candidate Michael Ellis, a former member of the home affairs select committee, said: ‘Labour’s grossly irresponsible obsession with targets led to a perverted sense of priorities whereby senior officers could get bonuses for prioritising car crime while hundreds of young girls were being abused with impunity.’ The first details of the scandal emerged earlier this year when papers from South Yorkshire Police, relating to child abuse in Sheffield, were leaked to the BBC. The documents and the testimony of former officers suggested the force failed to pursue a number of child sexual exploitation inquiries and ignored intelligence that girls as young as 12 were being raped. A copy of a document from the force’s intelligence database detailed more than 200 girls suspected of being sexually exploited. It listed more than 320 men accused of carrying out abuse, mainly between 2007 and 2010. Allegations included rapes, traffickings, child abduction and threats to scald girls by holding kettles of boiling water over them. The alleged victims were aged between 12 and 15 while their abusers included Iraqi Kurds, white British, black British, and men of Pakistani heritage. The dossier by Professor Alexis Jay (pictured) into the Rotherham scandal described how South Yorkshire Police were ‘more focused on dealing with offences such as burglary and vehicle crime’ than child abuse . In most cases, the files suggest there is no evidence police took any action. In 2007, after an investigation led to two Iraqi Kurds being convicted of abuse, officers asked for resources to mount a much wider investigation in Sheffield. Mr Brookes said he asked for £24,000 and was given £16,000. But after spending only half that amount he was told the entire budget had gone. He says the other £8,000 was diverted to spend chasing ‘district priorities, to investigate robbery, burglary and car crime’. These priorities were tied to Home Office targets introduced by Labour in 2002. In Rotherham, the dossier into the scandal there by Professor Alexis Jay described how senior and middle managers at South Yorkshire Police were ‘more focused on dealing with offences such as burglary and vehicle crime’ than tackling child abuse. At least 1,400 girls in the town were left to be abused by Asian men between 1997 and 2013 because the authorities were also too scared to admit there was a race issue, according to her report published in September. A second report by government adviser Louise Casey concluded the establishment in Rotherham ignored child sexual exploitation due to ‘misplaced political correctness’. And Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary found senior South Yorkshire officers prioritised burglary and car crime over victims of abuse. Labour’s crime targets meant forces were aware that chief constables could get the sack if performance was repeatedly inadequate. The link to performance-related pay that has emerged meant senior officers could pocket bonuses worth thousands for catching criminals or reducing the incidence of so-called priority offences. This system has also been scrapped by the Tories. South Yorkshire Police said: ‘Chief officer bonuses were ratified as part of a process overseen by police authorities.’"
"Norma Diffley, who ran a boutique in Donaghadee, died in the accident on the A2 dual carriageway between Bangor and Holywood close to the Devil's Elbow at Carney Hill on Monday afternoon.
The 33-year-old man is being questioned on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death.
He was arrested on Tuesday."
"The 22-year-old told his 3.6 million subscribers, as well his followers on Twitter, in a six-minute video called Coming Out.
I'm just going to be really honest,"" he said. ""2014 is truly the year that I have accepted who I am and become happy with that person.
""Today I want to talk to you guys about that and be open and honest, and tell you that I'm gay.""
Connor said he'd struggled with his sexuality since he was 12 and at first ignored his feelings.
""Growing up I knew that I was a little bit different than everyone else,"" he said. ""I always just had this feeling that I wasn't the same.
""But it wasn't until I was 12 years old until I really had pinpointed what that was.
""For some reason, my seventh-grade year, I had this thought in the back of my head, 'What if I'm gay?' I immediately was so terrified.
""I'm from a small town in the Midwest. That's not a normal thing there. I didn't know what the word meant. I'd only met a couple of gay people in my entire life.
""It was terrifying to me to have to think that I was something that I knew nothing about, so I immediately pushed it away and tried to not think about it.""
But Connor admitted he couldn't ignore what he felt and says he became depressed during his second year at university.
""As anyone who's gone through this knows, you can't not think about it.
""I was up all night for I can't tell you how many nights, just thinking about this. I was scared of it, I never told anyone.
""I tried to avoid it at high school by dating girls. All I wanted to be was like everyone else... but I would feel nothing.
""I felt so isolated... and it wasn't until my sophomore in college until I really thought about it.""
He says after telling a friend at university, he then told his friends, parents and siblings.
""They didn't look at me differently, they didn't treat me differently"" he said.
""Everyone was so great. They just said, 'OK,' like it was no big deal.
""This whole thing that I had built up inside me to be this huge deal for 22 years, wasn't.
""In just one year I've honestly felt like I am so happy with who I am.""
Connor's fans also rallied round the star with hashtags like #weloveyouconnor and #proudofconnor trending in the US.
However, some of his female followers said on Twitter that they were upset that they wouldn't be able to marry him.

"Attendances have fallen in recent years since the Premiership side moved from Edgeley Park in Stockport to AJ Bell Stadium in Barton in 2012.
Sale have moved home games back to Friday nights for the upcoming season.
""I think there is some rebuilding to do because I think people in the early days of moving have had a pretty poor experience,"" Cotton told BBC Sport.
""That could be queuing up on a motorway, couldn't get away from the stadium, couldn't buy a drink at the ground. Listening to the things we're going to do to change that, if people come down from now they will find a very different experience.
""The infrastructure is still well away from where it needs to be but there are plans to develop that.""
Cotton, 69, a former England and British and Irish Lions prop returned to Sale - a club he served as both a player and director - after Simon Orange's takeover of the Premiership side in June.
He has promised to be active in his role, despite his commitments with his clothing business.
""What I really want to see is a very strong north of England club that can compete at the highest level,"" he added.
""That is my motivation for giving up the precious thing that I have got, and that is my time.
""I think what was lacking before was that the board weren't very often represented at games home and away, and I think that is very wrong - board members will travel to away games and home games.""
One of the standout announcements from Sale's new 10-man board was that director of rugby Steve Diamond will have a seat on it.
However, Cotton insists there will be no conflict of interest with a member of the coaching staff also working as a director.
""It will put no strain whatsoever on the relationship, we're here to support him,"" Cotton continued.
""We'll be working very closely with Diamond to make sure we can achieve the ambition which we all hold - if we went down we'd still be with them.""
Diamond also confirmed they are close to signing a new full-back and are still looking for another player to add to their backline, with former Bath and London Welsh winger Nick Scott on trial with the club."

"A picture posing with a St Bernard dog in front of the snowy peak of the Matterhorn must top the list for the ultimate Swiss souvenir. But that iconic photo opportunity has been consigned to history after a Swiss town bans selfies with the giant rescue dogs. Zermatt in the Upper Valais area of Switzerland has imposed the ban after a report from an animal welfare charity alleged the dogs were kept in 'miserable conditions'. Scroll down for video . Posing with dogs like these St Bernards has now been banned by the Swiss town of Zermatt . According to the Swiss Animal Protection Agency, the St Bernard dogs are being kept as tourist props by a company in the town that treats them very badly. The organisation has carried out investigations into the conditions the dogs were being kept since 2012 and published a report earlier this year. The report said said when they were not being taken out on excursions with tourists, the dogs  were being kept locked up in confined conditions in an unheated condemned building for long periods of time. It claimed the dogs are left without food or water in foul smelling conditions and are not given enough exercise. When they are put on show,  the dogs are kept in the cold for long periods of time and quickly grow tired while posing for photographs, sometimes with children riding on their backs. The organisation has been calling for the town council of Zermatt to ban the use of the dogs for many years. In a statement, SAP said the town's decision showed it 'loves the animals'. Zermatt, under the shadow of the Matterhorn is a popular tourist desitnations . It said: 'SAP rejoices that the town of Zermatt has now taken action to ban taking pictures of St Bernard dogs in its territory. 'Zematt has shown that it loves the animals and it will put an end to the contemptible and dangerous shows these dogs were made part of by being used as tourist props. 'For several years, the SAP, and its section working in the Upper Valais have criticised the conditions in which these animals are kept, and time and time again, has complained about those who keep the animals in captivity, for their violation of laws on the protection of animals. 'The SAP will continue to do all its can to make sure these dogs, which at the moment are housed in a condemned building in miserable conditions flout animal protection rules, are kept in comfortable conditions that meet their needs. 'The SPA is offering its help on the condition those holding the owners decided to put these dogs in better accommodation after they have been used purely as objects for hire.' The mayor of the town, Christophe Bürgin, told Swiss radio station Walliser Bote: 'No Saint Bernard dogs will be used for photo shoots with tourists on the peaks of Gornergrat and Sunnegga. 'We have been able to convince providers that it is not right to continue to offer pictures in that way.' He said over the summer a few dogs might be found because of long-term contracts with tour operators but the practice will be stamped out by next winter. In March the association filed a legal complaint against the St Bernard owners, claiming that the dogs’ living and working conditions were abusive. MailOnline has contacted the St Bernard owners for comment."
"Over the same period Scotland housed 249 Syrian refugees and Northern Ireland 104, Home Office figures show.
Nine of Wales' 22 councils had taken part in the Syrian refugee settlement programme up to the end of June, four more than three months earlier.
Oxfam Cymru welcomed the increase but said the resettlement process remained ""painfully slow"" in Wales.
UK ministers have pledged to settle 20,000 Syrians in the UK by 2020 under a scheme launched in October 2015.
Between April and June Rhondda Cynon Taf resettled 18 refugees whilst Blaenau Gwent, Carmarthenshire and the Vale of Glamorgan took five each, as the four councils took part in the Home Office-funded scheme for the first time.
The five authorities already involved were Neath Port Talbot, which has now taken 27 refugees, Swansea (24), Ceredigion (11), Torfaen (10) and Caerphilly (seven).
Other local authorities, including Wrexham and Anglesey, also have plans to accommodate refugees fleeing war-torn Syria.
Matthew Hemsley from Oxfam Cymru said: ""We welcome the fact that more families have been brought to safety here and we know that more refugees from Syria have arrived over the summer.
""Yet we cannot ignore how painfully slow the resettlement process still is in Wales.
""While there is some improvement in terms of numbers resettled here, there is no doubt that Wales still could and should do more to help families who have seen their lives torn apart by this war.""
Mr Hemsley urged the Welsh Government and councils to work closely together to speed up the system."
"Eight San Francisco police officers accused of sending racist and homophobic text messages have been suspended, and the police chief is recommending that the veteran employees be sacked. Chief Greg Suhr announced in a statement Friday that he has asked a police oversight committee to approve firing the officers . He called the texts 'despicable' and says those who sent them 'clearly fall below the minimum standards required to be a police officer.' Authorities say that the offensive texts targeting blacks, Mexicans, Filipinos and gay men, which make repeated use of racist and homophobic slurs, were sent between 2011 and 2012. San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr (pictured) said that eight officers had been suspended and that he had recommended they be fired . Texts between San Francisco Police Department officers included racist, sexist and homophobic messages . Suhr says six others will face disciplinary actions that include reassignment to positions that don't have contact with the public. The messages were discovered by federal authorities investigating former sergeant Ian Furminger, who was convicted of corruption and sentenced to 41 months in prison. 'All n*****s must f*****g hang' and 'N*****s must be spayed' were among the texts uncovered. 'It's not against the law to put an animal down,' an officer said, referring to a black man in Furminger's house. Other texts were offensive to women and repeatedly used the word f**. The eight officers include Captain Jason Fox, 42, a two decade veteran and Sergeant Michael Wibunsin, a 12-year veteran, according to the San Francisco Chronicle's sources. Officers identified as Michael Robison, 46, a 23-year-veteran, Noel Schwab, 49, a 16-year-veteran and Michael Celis, who has been on the force for 16 years, have reportedly already resigned or said they will resign. Sean Doherty, an 11-year veteran and Rain Daugherty, a 15-year-officer, are also facing termination. Robison, Schwab and Celis have reportedly already resigned. Michael Robison, 46, a 23-year veteran of the force, has resigned. He gave an interview to the Advocate in 1999 (pictured) about being a gay officer. He said 'the ""good ol' boys"" system is on its way out' The offensive text messages were uncovered after federal corruption charges were brought against former SFPD sergeant Ian Furminger, who was sentenced to 41 months in prison last month . The eighth officer has not yet been identified, and was not aware about possible dismissal as of Friday. Robison is openly gay and told the LGBT magazine The Advocate in 1998: 'The ""good ol' boys"" system is on its way out, and the newer generation that's replaced them sees things from a more open-minded standpoint' He was accused of using a racial epithet against a suspect in the mid 1990s but the allegation was dismissed. In 2007 an officer named Jason Fox was accused of hitting a gay man's head against the wall and using his hair to clean up urine on the street outside a club. 'Do you think we want your AIDS-infected pee on our streets?’ Fox allegedly said. He  did not face police department discipline in the case because the statute of limitations had passed. Police commissioners at the time reached a $83,000 out of court settlement with the gay man. The SFPD did not respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online about whether the incident involved the same Jason Fox accused in the text message scandal. San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi said that more than 1,000 cases where the officers testified will need to be reviewed . Minutes from a San Francisco Family Violence Council meeting show that Fox was promoted from lieutenant to captain in 2013. Celis was suspended in 2004 after an incident when he tried to use his badge and pay a bribe to get into his wife's hotel room. Wibunsin and several other officers were accused of stealing $10,000 while executing a search warrant in 2011. Public Defender Jeff Adachi said he expects more than 1,000 cases where the officers testified to be reviewed. He has called for the Department of Justice to investigate San Francisco's police as it did with officers in Ferguson, Missouri, according to KQED."
"When you’re in good touch, it just takes a moment. Nathan Redmond had only been on the pitch for six minutes when he made the decisive intervention in this tightly-fought encounter, but what a crucial one it could prove to be. Steven Whittaker, with sharp eyes and precise feet, played Redmond in down the right touchline, the ball hugging the white line as it went forward. Redmond’s natural acceleration saw him spectacularly outpace Joe Bennett and his low cross was fired high into the net by Bradley Johnson at the back post.

Booked: Whittaker, Hooper . Referee: Andy Davies (Hampshire) Attendance: 28,890 (3,214 away) From start to finish, the move took about 10 seconds. Norwich were inferior for pretty much the rest of the contest but needed only this flash of inspiration to keep their Barclays Premier League promotion hopes on course. It just takes a moment. It took Alex Neil’s record as manager to 11 wins from 16 - a magnificent return - and has them breathing down the necks of Middlesbrough and Bournemouth, who occupy those coveted automatic spots. Down and out of the race at the New Year, they are now fancied by many. The manner of the defeat would have frustrated Chris Hughton, desperate to get one over on his former employers. But in the end, even he would appreciate the ruthless smash and grab nature of Norwich’s win here. Hughton insisted in advance of the game that he bore no animosity to his former employers, who dumped him in April 2014 as the club sat 17th and safe in the Premier League. They weren’t able to maintain that position and were relegated but under the masterful guidance of Neil have mounted an impressive late charge for an immediate return to the big time. The Canaries travelled down to the south coast having lost just once in their last dozen games and eight wins within that sequence had them anchored in the play-offs, with reasonable hope of more. And in persistent drizzle at The Amex, they made the brighter opening. Jonny Howson touched a free-kick short to Johnson who, off a fast bowler’s run-up, leathered a rocket shot that David Stockdale had to turn around the post. If Norwich do gain promotion, Cameron Jerome will have been one of the main reasons with his 19 goals and his awareness teed up Wes Hoolahan, whose shot was blocked by Stockdale at his near post. Jerome gesticulates during the Championship encounter at the Amex Stadium on Good Friday . Norwich midfielder Jonathan Howson shows his anger at a decision by shouting at the linesman . And Jerome was a stud’s length away from turning home Martin Olsson’s wicked left-wing cross just before the half-hour mark. Brighton, down in 16th, have little to play for but pride in the remaining weeks of the season but they seized control of the game as the first-half drew on. Rohan Ince and Beram Kayal gained a stranglehold on the midfield, while Liverpool loanee Joao Teixeira was often too hot for the Norwich defence to handle. He was wayward, however, when Kayal seized upon a weak pass from Sebastien Bassong, roamed unchallenged into the area and set him up in a good shooting-position. Teixeira dragged his effort wide of the post, to Bassong’s great relief. But the skilful Portuguese was soon back in the action, waltzing into the area and firing off a firm low shot that Ruddy palmed back out. Chris O’Grady was lurking but Norwich captain Russell Martin cleared. Johnson shoots at Brighton goalkeeper David Stockdale's during his side's 1-0 win against Brighton . In stoppage time, it was the turn of Graham Dorrans to be hesitant at the back, clearing in too much of a hurry and inviting Teixeira to run it back. Ruddy blocked with his legs at the near post. In the away technical area, Neil cut an irritated figure. He stomped around restlessly, throwing up his arms and cursing every time a move broke down. His half-time team talk was no doubt voluble. It took a while to sink in but the result was spectacular when it did as Johnson made the difference. ‘Going up, up, up’ chanted the 3,000-plus from Norfolk and for the only time all afternoon, Neil permitted himself a smile. Hughton rolled the dice, introducing Kazenga LuaLua first then Leon Best and Craig Mackail-Smith. Slowly, they started to create more and Ruddy bravely intervened to reach LuaLua’s drilled cross in front of Mackail-Smith. But the late siege didn’t come and Norwich go rolling on.

"Christopher Tate, who also runs Donington Park circuit, said most of the British industry was in ""Motorsport Valley"", in central England counties.
On Wednesday, the Welsh Government refused to underwrite the £350m private funding for the Welsh circuit.
Developers say they have a new deal which could proceed within eight weeks.
The Heads of the Valleys Development Company, which runs the Circuit of Wales, has said up to 6,000 jobs could be created by the project.
Mr Tate, a director of the Association of Motor Racing Circuit Owners, told the BBC's Good Morning Wales programme there had always been ""an eyebrow raised"" about some of the claims made about the size of the proposed Circuit of Wales.
He stressed it was not a question of not wanting more competition, but being ""surprised and concerned"" about the figures involved.
""When it came to the point that it was apparent that private investment felt it needed to be underwritten by the government of Wales, more eyebrows were raised, as you can imagine, among the members of our association - 17 of them, including circuits of course in Wales at Pembrey and on Anglesey - that said 'really?
""'Wouldn't be nice if all our private investors got underwritten by our government?'.""
He said the recent announcement by First Minister Carwyn Jones that the TVR car company would establish a new factory in the Ebbw Vale enterprise zone and bring about 150 jobs, was still ""a long way short of the much-vaunted 6,000"".
""That number depends on the building of hotels and restaurants and other factory units and industrial units and so on,"" he said.
""Right across the UK - not just in Wales - there is not a shortage of empty industrial space at the moment.
""The second [point] is, the British motor sport industry is very much focused on what they call 'Motorsport Valley' - running approximately from Oxford up in a loop through Northamptonshire towards Leicestershire and Derbyshire.
""Now, in that area lies 50,000 jobs and they're all a little bit interdependent.
""So it doesn't matter if someone had suggested that a new motor racing track be built in Cornwall or in Aberdeen or in Ebbw Vale or, for that matter, in Norwich.
""It would still have been well outside the natural agglomeration of these industries, and that's always been another reason for the raising of an eyebrow.""
Circuit of Wales director Michael Carrick has been contacted for a response.
The Welsh Government has declined to comment."

The cafe is the first of its kind to be opened in Russia and was influenced by the many cat cafes that have opened up in parts of far-east Asia . Its inaugural opening was captured on video and felines can be seen dotted around the room on various ledges as customers enjoy cups of tea and coffee. The fixtures and fittings are catered to the cats and feature scratching posts, hammocks and even feline-themed wallpaper.

Oleg Agronovich, co-owner of the cafe, also makes an appearance in the short clip. He says: ‘Almost every cat and animal fan would like to see a place like this near them, where they can communicate with animals and just relax.’ All of the cats that live at the cafe were rescued from a local shelter and have each been vaccinated and chipped ."
"A California woman who was recording police activity said she was terrified when a deputy U.S. marshal walked toward her, grabbed her cell phone out of her hands and smashed it with his foot. The incident was recorded by another woman with a smartphone camera across the street. Beatriz Paez filed a complaint Wednesday with police in South Gate, just south of Los Angeles. However, the police don't have authority over marshals. Paez is also considering a lawsuit. Paez said she was out walking Sunday when she noticed what looked like an arrest several houses up the street. She stood on the sidewalk, recording with her phone. The woman said marshals asked her to stop recording but she told them she had a right to do so. The second woman who was recording had focused on the interaction between Paez and the marshals, who Paez said told her to stop recording. At one point on the video you can hear Paez say, ""You're making me feel unsafe. I have a right to be here."" Paez said she was a few homes away from the center of the police activity. In the video, an officer with a rifle walks in her direction. ""I was terrified. I was getting really scared,"" she said. As he gets close, the marshal then runs a few steps toward her and wrestles the phone from her hands. Paez said he stomped on it then kicked it away. It is unclear what happened to the video she recorded. The U.S. Marshals Service said it is reviewing the incident. Janice Hahn, the U.S. representative for Paez's district, told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" that she had written a letter to outgoing U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. Hahn said she wants a federal investigation into the actions of the officer. She called the marshal's actions illegal because Paez wasn't hindering an investigation or arrest."
"The 23-year-old made 116 as Tim Groenewald and Lewis Gregory rattled through the rest of the hosts line-up.
Jennings, who hit 15 fours, finally fell top-edging Josh Davey to gully before Durham were bowled out for 256.
Tom Abell and Davey fell lbw to Rushworth, then Onions bowled Marcus Trescothick as Somerset closed on 30-3.
Durham batsmen Mark Stoneman and Scott Borthwick both fell cheaply as Somerset started brightly before Jack Burnham (33) helped repair the innings in a 79-run third-wicket partnership with Jennings.
Burnham eventually fell when he was bowled by Davey.
Gregory then claimed two wicket in two balls, including uprooting Paul Collingwood's middle stump first ball, as Somerset looked to gain some momentum.
Rushworth became Gregory's fourth victim of the day, departing to an exceptional slip catch from Jim Allenby it left the visitors with 12 overs to face.
And last year's Division One leading wicket-taker struck in his fourth when Abell was trapped playing across the line before nightwatchman Davey was caught out in the next over when the ball nipped back.
Onions' inswinging yorker then dismissed the Somerset captain as the away side limped to the close, trailing by 226 runs."
"The ruling is likely to encourage thousands of passengers with similar claims in the UK.
Jet2 argued the compensation payments should be delayed pending the outcome of a similar case in the Netherlands.
But the judge at Liverpool County Court ruled that ""a line should now be drawn. Justice delayed is justice denied"".
The EU has ruled that airlines must pay compensation for delayed flights, but a number of airlines have yet to pay out.
Four airlines in the UK have made applications to delay payments: Jet2, Thomas Cook, Ryanair and WizzAir.
The Jet2 case heard in Liverpool involved Kim Allen, who claimed â‚¬400 (Â£292) compensation after an almost seven-hour delay when flying from Manchester to Malaga in 2012.
""We've all been kept waiting for so long, but I'm really happy with today's decision,"" she said after the judge's ruling.
""Hopefully now it's time for the airlines to pay us what the law says they should.""
Her solicitor, Kevin Clarke from Bott & Co, said he hoped ""the airlines will now finally face up to their obligations to passengers and to settle the hundreds of thousands of legitimate claims outstanding.
""Sadly, the history of their conduct over the last decade would tell us to expect yet another legal challenge.""
The issue stems from the 2004 European regulations that oblige airlines, in some cases, to pay compensation to passengers for cancellations and delays, if they are not due to extraordinary circumstances.
A further ruling by the European Court of Justice in 2009 confirmed that delayed passengers should be treated as if their flights had been cancelled, if the delay was longer than three hours, entitling them to cash compensation.
Despite the ruling, a number of airlines in the UK are still arguing that some technical problems should be classified as extraordinary circumstances, and as such, no compensation should be due.
They have also argued that paying compensation for delays of three hours or more is disproportionate and too great a burden."
"The 30-year-old, excluded from the World Championships by USA Swimming after a drink-drive conviction, won in one minute 54.75 seconds in Texas.
Phelps, an 18-time Olympic champion, also recorded the year's fastest times to win the 100m and 200m butterfly.
Ryan Lochte won world 200m individual medley gold in 1:55.81 on Thursday.
American Lochte, 31, also holds the world record for the event of 1:54.00, which he swam in 2011.
""Ryan and I have been pretty dominant in that race since we started racing back in 2004,"" said Phelps.
""I'm looking forward to getting back in and competing with him.
""I've been away from the sport for a while and I feel like I'm kind of back where I used to be. It's good to be here.""
On Saturday, Phelps won the 100m butterfly in 50.45 seconds, faster than the 50.56 South African Chad Le Clos swam to win world gold on the same day.
A day earlier, Phelps won the American 200m butterfly title in one minute 52.94 seconds in San Antonio - 0.54secs faster than Hungary's Laszlo Cseh swam in winning the world title in Kazan, Russia.
Phelps, who was convicted of drink-driving in December and served a six-month ban from competition, now has a record 55 national titles."
"Heinrich Boere, who is in a wheelchair, was taken by ambulance from his nursing home in Germany to a prison hospital.
He was sentenced in March 2010 after confessing to the killings.
A German court rejected an appeal against his jail term and a medical expert said he was fit to serve his sentence at a ""suitable"" facility.
During his trial, Boere had admitted to the killings in 1944, but said he had been acting on orders from his superiors.
He shot dead Fritz Bicknese, a chemist and father of 12; Frans Kusters, a Dutch resistance member who owned a bicycle shop; and Teun de Groot, who helped Jews go into hiding.
Boere argued that he risked being sent to a concentration camp if he refused to carry out the shootings.
""At no time in 1944 did I act with the feeling that I was committing a crime,"" he told the court during his trial, but added that 65 years later he saw things from a different perspective.
The presiding judge, Gerd Nohl, said all three killings had been carried out ""on a totally random basis"" and constituted murder.
Boere was born in Germany to a Dutch father and a German mother but grew up in the Dutch town of Maastricht.
He joined the Waffen SS when the Nazis overran his hometown in 1940.
In 1947 he escaped from a prisoner of war camp in the Netherlands and returned to Germany.
A tribunal in Amsterdam sentenced him to death for the killings in his absence in 1949, but this was later commuted to life in prison.
He was never extradited and a German court ruled in the 1980s that the Dutch trial had been unfair because Boere had not been present.
In April 2008, more than 60 years after the killings, he was indicted in Germany.
After legal arguments about whether he was well enough to stand trial he was eventually convicted last year."
"The bird and wildlife charity was due to unveil its new sites at Snape and Hollesley later.
However, the flooded River Alde over-topped the reserve at Snape, filling the freshwater marshes with saltwater.
Work to clear up the damage is continuing and the RSPB said it hoped to open the reserves in the spring.
Aaron Howe, RSPB reserves project manager, said: ""The rain has helped flush out virtually all of the salt and the marsh will recover, but the project has been delayed.""
The 125-acre marsh at Snape is an extension to the existing 70-acre reserve.
The reserve at Hollesley was not flooded, but the RSPB was hoping to formally open it on the same day as it opened Snape."
"A gay couple getting married this summer had their wedding plans featured on Hillary Clinton's announcement that she is joining the race for the White House. Democrat campaigners Jared Milrad and Nate Johnson, from Chicago, Illinois, claimed they were surprised to find out that their same-sex wedding plans were featured on Sunday's video announcing Clinton's 2016 bid. The pair were seen walking hand in hand in what quickly became one of the most widely viewed political clips of the year. Milrad's voice is heard in a voiceover saying: 'I’m getting married this summer to someone I really care about.' Scroll down for videos . Jared Milrad (pictured right) and his fiancé Nate Johnson, who are campaigning Democrats, were featured in Hillary Clinton's video announcing her 2016 White House bid . The couple, who are planning a summer wedding, were featured walking hand in hand during Clinton's video to announce her 2016 bid for the White House . 'We were both out shopping, working on wedding invitations,' Milrad said of finding out about their new-found fame. He said he was overjoyed to be part of the Clinton rollout - and part of a large-scale change in U.S. social attitudes. 'It shows how far we've come,' said Milrad, 31-year-old lawyer and social activist, pleased that public support for same-sex marriage rights has grown so far as to appear in a presidential campaign launch. Mr Johnson, 30, is a project manager for a health care consulting company. The couple will get married in July in a Chicago park bordering Lake Michigan then have their reception at a LGBT community center, The Washington Blade reported. The couple told The Blade that they would be making financial contributions to Clinton's campaign and would volunteer. Both have previously volunteered in presidential campaigns. Johnson supported Clinton in 2008 while Milrad worked for Obama in New Hampshire. The gay couple were only one in a diverse series of aspirational Americans featured in the Clinton ad, which casts a broad demographic net as she hunts for a winning coalition of voters. The video also featured Spanish-speaking brothers preparing to start a business, a mother seeking to return to the work force, an Asian-American college graduate and expectant African-American parents. 'Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion,' Clinton says on the video. 'So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote.' The vibrant clip, set to snappy music and featuring Clinton for less than half the video's length, is a dramatic departure from Clinton's drab announcement of seven years ago. The video which kicked off her former unsuccessful campaign showed Clinton on a couch, talking about ending the Iraq war, shrinking deficits and expanding affordable health care. Mr Milrad, who is the founder of social enterprise program the Civic Legal Corps, worked for Obama during the 2008 Democrat primaries in New Hampshire when the President was running against Clinton . Milrad, who is a lawyer and social campaigner, worked for Obama in New Hampshire during his 2008 White House bid . The couple pictured at the White House. They have been active campaigners in Democrat campaigns and plan to donate financially to Clinton's White House bid . It made no mention of same-sex unions. Barack Obama, the candidate who beat her to the White House, was personally opposed to gay marriage in 2008 and only recently converted to the cause. 'It's a sea change in progress that we see in our country,' Milrad said. Minutes after the Clinton announcement, Milrad took to Twitter to offer his endorsement -- and to invite Clinton to the upcoming Milrad-Johnson nuptials. 'We have not officially heard from Hillary,' admitted Johnson, a health consultant. 'We are going to extend an option of a plus-one for her. She'll probably want to bring someone.'"
"Looking after elderly parents can be difficult at the best of times. But this man takes caring for his Alzheimer's-suffering mother to another level. A security guard from China has touched hearts across the country because he takes his 84-year-old mother with him to work on the back of his motorbike every single day, reported the People's Daily Online. Lu Xincai, who lives in Zhejiang province in eastern China, says that he is scared his mother will get lost if he leaves her at home by herself because she suffers from the degenerative disease. Devoted: Lu Xincai takes his 84-year-old mother to work with him on the back of his motorbike every day. He ties a sash around both of their waists to make sure she doesn't fall off . She would often go up to the mountains to collect firewood and there were a few occasions when she got lost after dark. When Mr Lu's father passed away earlier this year, he decided to take his mother with him to work because there was no one else who could look after her. His wife works in a different city and his son is still in school. After helping his mother to get up at 5am every morning, he puts her on the back seat of his motorbike and ties a sash around both of their waists to ensure that she does not fall off. Mr Lu said that he rides the four kilometres to work slowly to make sure his mother feels safe and so that they can chat along the way. The whole journey takes an hour. Even when at work he checks up on his mother, who has been given her own room by his employers, a bank, to make sure that she has not wandered off somewhere. He said that his mother devoted her life to caring for her children, and now he feels like he has a duty to care for her in return. Vulnerable: His elderly mother suffers from Alzheimer's and used to get lost when she was left alone . He said: 'I was an apple in my mum's eye, and now she's my apple.' 'Our mother carried us on her back to the fields when she went to work on the farm and collect firewood when we were young.' He added: 'Only if I see her will I feel relaxed. Otherwise I would be afraid is she had wandered away.'"
"A man accused of removing women’s teeth with pliers and a screwdriver during sex because he liked ‘gummy ladies’ claims he was just trying to ‘help’ them. New Zealander Philip Lyle Hansen, 56, has pleaded not guilty to 11 charges, including unlawful sexual connection and charges of wounding with intent to injure four women between 1988 and 2011. On Wednesday a Wellington District Court jury continued hearing evidence from a woman, 47, who was in a relationship with Hansen during the 1990s. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the court she never consented to Hansen pulling out her teeth but was too ‘afraid’ to say anything. Crown prosecutor Sally Carter warned the jury that during the trial they would hear evidence about Hansen's ‘fascination or obsession with them [women] not having any teeth’. New Zealander Philip Lyle Hansen, 56, is accused of removing women’s teeth with pliers and a screwdriver during sex . ‘He liked his women without teeth,’ Ms Carter said in her opening address, the New Zealand Herald reports. The court watched a video form 2012 of the woman talking about how Hansen allegedly held her against a car door and removed six of her bottom teeth, using an oily rag to stop the bleeding, during sex. She later had all her teeth removed and replaced with dentures, but when her wisdom teeth started coming through Hansen allegedly removed them with a screwdriver. ‘He had a screwdriver in his hand, he then tilted my head back... after that he had grabbed the screwdriver and started digging at the back of my gums to try and get out these wisdom teeth,’ she said in the video. A woman, 47, has claimed Hansen 'grabbed the screwdriver and started digging at the back of my gums' During cross-examination defence lawyer Mike Antunovic said the woman had let Hansen pull out six teeth from her lower jaw and that Hansen was just trying to help the women, not hurt them. ‘So after he pulled out the first tooth ... the second tooth, the third tooth, the fourth tooth, the fifth tooth, the sixth tooth ... you didn't ask him to stop?’ said Mr Antunovic. ‘No,’ replied the woman, who said she had been drinking that night but was not heavily intoxicated. The lawyer said the woman had not objected to Hansen extracting her teeth with pliers. ‘You opened your mouth to allow him to put the pliers in,’ said Mr Antunovic. ‘I would not just freely open my mouth to a pair of pliers,’ said the woman. Hansen's lawyer said the woman had not objected to Hansen extracting her teeth with pliers . ‘Well, you didn't shut your mouth. You didn't tell him to stop,’ said the lawyer. The woman told the court she couldn't, saying ‘I had no choice’. Mr Antunovic suggested Hansen had been trying to help the woman when he tried to remove her emerging wisdom teeth with a screwdriver after she complained about the problems they were causing her. ‘Do you think Philip was trying to help you, in his own way?’ he said. ‘Not really, no,’ said the woman. Hansen was arrested in December 2012. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."

"The former Hearts captain recently left Leeds, having moved to Elland Road last summer despite a trial at Rangers.
""I'm excited to come here from Leeds and on the first day it felt like it was the right decision,"" Zaliukas told the club's website.
""It's a brilliant stadium and it's going to be fun to play here.""
Zaliukas played more than 200 times for Hearts over seven years, but made just 15 appearances for Leeds last term.
His first competitive match for Rangers could be against Hibs in the Challenge Cup on 5 August.
The Ibrox outfit's first Scottish Championship fixture of the campaign is against Hearts at Ibrox on 10 August.
""I think the Championship is going to be a very interesting league because Hearts and Hibs are in here, and even Falkirk and Queen of the South are going to be tough teams,"" the 30-year-old added.
""I think our squad could compete straight away in the Premiership, everyone is experienced and top players. I think we are going to have a very good squad.""
Rangers have also added former St Mirren defender Darren McGregor to their ranks this summer."
"Sheriffs are hunting a gunman who shot a young woman through the neck as she was driving down a Colorado interstate, amid fears he may have tried to attack other drivers too. The unnamed 20-year-old woman was driving on the I-25 in Weld County, north of Denver, when her window shattered and she felt bleeding from both sides of her neck. In a chilling 911 call from around 11pm Wednesday night, she told operators: 'I'm on the highway right now and somebody just hit me and I'm bleeding from my neck and I'm scared. 'I don't know if they hit me or if they threw something out the window... my neck hurts. I think there's glass in my neck.' Scroll down for video . Highway shooting: A bullet passed clean through a woman's neck after she was shot at by an unknown gunman driving down the I-25 highway north of Denver, Colorado . She was taken to hospital where surgeons found she had been shot clean through the neck. Miraculously, the bullet did not damage the woman's airway or sever any major blood vessels. She is expected to recover, according to 7News Denver. The woman, from the nearby town of Milliken, said that she had seen a dark SUV just before her window shattered and she felt the gunshot wound. Deputies from the Weld County Sheriff's Office have said that the shooting may be linked to other unexplained reports of shattered windows on highways in northern Colorado. Hours before the woman was shot, a man's rear window was shattered as he drove on the nearby I-76 after he heard a 'pop' sound which could have been gunfire. The previous day a prison van transporting inmates along the I-25 had its window shattered by an unidentified 'projectile', the Coloradoan reported. Another incident came on Thursday, when a man's driver-side window shattered as he drove down a nearby county road during the daytime. Nobody was injured in any of the other incidents. Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said drivers should be aware and report suspicious behavior as deputies investigate. 'There's a lot more leg work that needs to be done on this case,' Smith said. 'It's hard because at this point we have no indication that this person was targeted by a person looking for her.' Deputies were yesterday pictured investigating an abandoned black SUV on I-25, which had shattered rear windows. It is not clear whether this was the vehicle the woman had seen."
"Bethany Haines also told ITV News that she hoped her father's body would be returned to his family.
Mr Haines, who was born in Yorkshire and educated in Perth, was killed by IS earlier this month.
He had been taken hostage while carrying out aid work with refugees in Syria.
Mr Haines had been living in Croatia with his second wife, who is Croatian, and their four-year-old daughter. His parents live in Ayr.
His older daughter Bethany gave her television interview from her home in Scotland as MPs prepare to vote on military action against IS.
The 17-year-old said: ""IS need to be eradicated. They can't continue this way. They can't be doing this to people and get away with it. No matter what nationality, if they are Western or not.
""Hundreds of Syrians have been killed by them. They need to be stopped. If airstrikes and ground force is what it takes, that's what it takes.""
Ms Haines said her family had been touched and moved by the messages of support they had received.
She added: ""Anyone who needed help he was there. Tragically he's lost his life doing what he loved but he wouldn't have stopped. Even if he'd come back after this he would've gone out again and again and again. He loved helping people.
""He was such a bright character. Always making people laugh, telling jokes. He was a brilliant man. And he will be remembered like that by everyone who knew him and probably by people who didn't know him.
""He will be remembered and not for the way he was shown in that video. But for the truly amazing work he did and the bright character he was.""
Bethany Haines said her father's commitment to helping others had encouraged her to follow his example.
""I'm hoping to do some aid work after next year and do a bit of work with a charity,"" she said.
""Hopefully it will spark a career doing that. He'd tell me of all the people he'd helped and I want to do that too."""
"At least 54 sailors are dead and 63 have been rescued after a trawler sank off the Russian coast north of Japan. The freezer trawler with an international crew of 132 sank this morning in the freezing waters of the Sea of Okhotsk 205 miles off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. Emergency services in Kamchatka said 63 crew members of the Dalny Vostok were rescued with the sea's temperature near zero degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) - but a further 15 are still missing. Scroll down for video . The freezer trawler with an international crew of 132 sank this morning in the freezing waters of the Sea of Okhotsk 205 miles off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula . More than 25 fishing boats in the area helped to pull the crew members to safety, the emergency services said in a statement on their website. The ship was carrying 78 Russian nationals, as well as 54 foreign nationals from Myanmar, Ukraine, Lithuania and Vanuatu. No official cause for the sinking has been given but the Interfax news agency said drifting ice in the chilly Pacific waters may have played a role. Water flooded the engine compartment and the trawler sank within 15 minutes, the BBC said. The trawler sank 205 miles west of Krutogorovsky settlement in the Kamchatka region and 250 km south of the city of Magadan. Emergency services in Kamchatka said 63 crew members of the Dalny Vostok trawler were rescued with the sea's temperature near zero degrees Celsius (file picture of the Sea of Okhotsk) The Russian Emergencies Ministry sent an Mi-8 helicopter with rescuers and doctors aboard to deliver medical assistance and transport rescued crew members to hospitals in Magadan.

"The distinctive head bop was still there and the white socks pulled up over the calves but plastered across her face was something we are not used to seeing during Paula Radcliffe’s races – a beaming smile. When she set the World Record of 2:15.25 in the London Marathon in April 2003 – a time no woman has threatened 12 years later – there was no grinning until after she crossed the line. Similarly in 2005 when she recorded her third and final victory over the 26.2mile course from Blackheath to The Mall, emotions were kept in check until the end. The crowd lining the London Marathon course cheers for Paula Radcliffe as she wraps up a stellar career . Radcliffe breaks down at the end of the London Marathon on Sunday, her final competitive race . The world record holder for 12 years, Radcliffe said the time was irrelevant in her final London Marathon . Radcliffe runs down The Mall hand-in-hand with a fellow runner as she  takes in the atmosphere . But a time of 2:36.55 in her final competitive marathon is not to be sniffed at for a 41-year-old with a left foot as flexible as a rod of iron who described herself as ‘unfit and unprepared’ for the race. It is well inside 2:42.00, the IAAF qualifying standard for the Rio Olympics next summer. The British Athletics standards – which are likely to be sterner - have yet to be announced but it is immaterial as Radcliffe maintained this was it for her elite running career. ‘My body can’t train at this level any more,’ she said, ‘In Kenya [where she did a winter training camp] I pushed myself too hard and I broke down. I’m sure the magic of London helped me run faster than I would or should have been capable of.’ Radcliffe was due to give a BBC interview on Tower Bridge with Denise Lewis but the former heptathlete could not keep up. ‘She ran alongside me for a little bit but it was too loud and I didn’t want to stop because I was worried my foot wouldn’t be able to start again.’ Instead of running with the elite women, Radcliffe chose to take off with the 37,000-strong mass field . Radcliffe smiles at the front of the mass group as the elite men prepare to set off on their run . The 41-year-old sets off with the main field after having barely run since February due to injury . Radcliffe was in nowhere near the condition she was in when she set the 26.2mile world record in 2003 . Radcliffe began strongly, running at 2:30.00 pace for the opening 10kilometres. ‘I ran the first mile in 5min30sec which was way too quick but every time someone shouted in the crowd it boosted me up again,’ said Radcliffe, . ‘I felt the achilles twinge at 7 miles then backed off. As much as my body wanted it to finish I didn’t want it to end.’ In the women’s elite race, the attention pre-race was centred on four Kenyan women but Tigist Tufa broke away from the pack to become only the third Ethiopian to win the London marathon, after Derata Tulu in 2001 and Aselefech Mergia in 2010. Tufa, who the bookmakers judged a 25/1 shot before the race, crossed the line in 2:23.22 with two-time winner Mary Keitany 18 seconds behind. Ethiopia’s Tirfi Tsegaye was third in 2:23.41. Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge, a World Champion over 5,000m, triumphed in the men’s race in 2:04.42, five seconds ahead of his compatriot Wilson Kipsang.

"Aaron Ramsey has scored 25 goals for Arsenal since the start of last season, none more vital than a dramatic extra-time winner in the FA Cup final. But his last one — the only goal of the game at Burnley — meant the world, because it was for someone special. ‘I’ve had a tough few weeks,’ said Ramsey, who pointed skywards after scoring at Turf Moor. ‘I’ve been on an emotional rollercoaster of late. My gran passed away a few weeks ago and she meant an awful lot to me. We had a great relationship and I’ve dedicated my last couple of goals to her. Aaron Ramsey celebrates his goal against Burnley by dedicating it to his late Gran who passed away . ‘Her name is Eileen. She’s on my Mum’s side and we used to call her Nanny Leany. She was 84. She was an incredible woman. ‘She lost her husband early in her life and raised seven kids on her own and in those days it was an incredibly difficult thing to do. She was always happy, making jokes and I had that sort of outlook on life. She always believed in me and gave me reassurances. It has been a difficult time.’ His grandmother would have been proud of young Aaron as he took time out from preparations for today’s FA Cup semi-final against Reading to pay his tribute to her. Just as she must have been proud of his career in football and the way he rebuilt it after a badly broken leg. ‘She used to watch me play and would take me to games when I was eight or nine,’ Ramsey added. ‘She would always be asking how I was doing. She didn’t go to my games but I got her Sky to watch a few. She would always complain it was not on normal TV.’ Ramsey will be on ‘normal TV’ when the BBC screen today’s semi-final from Wembley, as he was last May when his 16th goal of a prolific season won the FA Cup and ended Arsenal’s nine-year wait for a trophy. ‘It was a great day and a great moment in my career,’ he said. ‘It was a relief as well.’ Ramsey points to the sky has the goalscorer is greeted by Arsenal right back Hector Bellerin at Turf Moor . Ramsey and Bellerin celebrate on the deck after the Welsh midfielder had fired home for the Gunners . Arsenal had fought back from two down against Hull and 108 minutes had elapsed when Ramsey fired his side into a 3-2 lead before going off on a celebratory sprint which he ended flat on his back, exhausted, beneath a pile of jubilant team-mates. ‘I was knackered,’ smiled Ramsey. ‘We were in extra-time and my celebration, I didn’t really know what to do. I was just running about and it all caught up on me then so I needed a couple of seconds just to get my breath back and realise just what I’d just actually done. It was definitely overwhelming. And it was a great way to finish the season for me personally and for the team finally to win something. It was an amazing feeling. Ramsey wheels away in celebration after scoring in extra time at Wembley against Hull City . Ramsey is joined by Spanish midfielder Mikel Arteta during the FA Cup Final at Wembley in 2014 . The Welsh goalscorer is mobbed by his friends as they celebrate his goal at Wembley in 2014 . ‘I’m no different to anyone else. My dream was always scoring a goal in the FA Cup final and I had managed to live my dream. Then to see how much it meant to people when a quarter of a million came out on the streets the next day. It was a beautiful day and you could see everyone was in it together.’ Ramsey had played in the 2008 FA Cup final for Cardiff aged 17, but his winners’ medal now takes pride of place in a display cabinet in the study at his home. ‘I’ve a few shirts in there, my debut shirt at Cardiff, the FA Cup winners’ shirt, some boots to mark my achievements,’ said Ramsey. ‘And there’s a big desk in there which I never use. The Welshman looks chuffed as he sets his eyes on the gleaming silverware he helped earn his side . Goalscorer Ramsey hugs his FA Cup following his goal against Hull City at Wembley in 2014 . More than a quarter of a million fans took to the streets to celebrates Arsenal's 2014 FA Cup success . ‘That feeling you get after winning is difficult to get. Everyone realised we wanted more. We are putting pressure on ourselves to get the best from each other and I feel we’ve done that in the second half of this season. ‘We’ve really stuck by each other, worked hard for each other and we want another feeling like we had last season. We do push ourselves as a team and I think the title is getting closer. Last season we started really well and maybe faded away. We lost against the bigger teams, but this season we’ve done better against them. This season, we didn’t start too well but the second half has been really good and consistent. I feel we are very close.’ If Chelsea collapse against the odds in the title race, Arsenal are best placed to pounce after a run of 33 points from a dozen Barclays Premier League games since New Year’s Day. ‘That’s still a possibility,’ said Ramsey. ‘You can’t rule it out. You can’t. When you have that momentum, it is still possible. Even though it will be difficult we have to win our remaining games and see where that leaves us. ‘It’s going to be difficult. Chelsea have a lot of points, so they will have to slip up a few times for us to catch them. So it will be difficult, but it’s still possible.’ His optimism reflects the mood in Arsenal’s camp, very different from this time last year when they went into an FA Cup semi-final stifled by the desperation to end the trophy-free years and Arsene Wenger’s uncertain future. They staggered past Wigan on penalties. Arsenal goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski makes a save against Wigan Athletic during FA Cup semi final match . Fabianski's save helped Arsenal to progress to the FA Cup final which they won at Wembley in 2014 . Arsenal are stronger and more solid now, with more weaponry, flair and freedom than last year. But that does not mean they will swat Reading aside. ‘We probably did feel the pressure,’ admitted Ramsey. ‘But we got through and went on to win it and we haven’t got that sort of pressure now. That pressure is gone because we won something and there is no more of this “nine years”. ‘It’s a different sort of pressure, but one we’ve been up against many times when we’ve played lesser teams. It’s important not to take the game lightly. We just have to focus and if we manage ourselves correctly, we will go through.’ Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will be hoping to add another piece of silverware to his collection ."
"These eerie photographs show the inside of an abandoned 19th century Victorian  asylum which has lay dormant for 20 years. Opened in 1818, the asylum once housed nearly 1,000 patients and expands over 350 metres in length overlooking the town of Stafford in the West Midlands. It closed in 1995 but is now set to have new life breathed into it after planning permission was granted to build 102 apartments in its place. Shattered doors, overturned bathtubs and crumbling floors dominate the Grade II listed St George's County Asylum where patients were restrained by means of 'the leather muff,' 'iron handcuffs' and 'restraint chair'. There are also reports of prevalent dysentery and syphilis. Scroll down for video . A mysterious past: The history of this 19th century asylum in the West Midlands saw patients being restrained by means of 'the leather muff,' 'iron handcuffs' and 'restraint chair'. St George's County Asylum first opened in 1818 and once housed nearly 1,000 patients . Run down: Shattered doors, overturned bathtubs and crumbling floors dominate the Grade II listed St George's County Asylum in Stafford . Empty room: The asylum was initially large enough for 120 patients but between 1879 and 1884 two extra wings were added. This included workshops and bakeries bringing capacity to just under 1,000. The hospital shut its doors in 1995 and 145 long-term patients were re-located . Derelict: An overturned bath tub as it was abandoned (left). Dysentery and syphilis were said to have been commonplace at the now run down asylum (as pictured in 1940 right) where suicide cages were erected in the stairwells after a female patient threw herself off the fourth floor . Suicide cages were erected in the stairwells after a female patient threw herself off the fourth floor and landed near the reception. It now lies in a terrible state, but building work is under way to transform the site into new homes. Property developer Shropshire Homes is beginning work on demolishing parts of the asylum beyond repair as part of a project to revamp the structure into 102 apartments. The apartments, the first of which are due to be occupied by early next year, will be priced between just under £100,000 and up to £300,000 for what company director Howard Thorne described as the 'penthouse apartments'. He said the parts of the asylum being demolished were 'structurally unsound' and that it was impossible for them to be preserved. St George's County Asylum, which was renamed St George’s Hospital in 1937, was built at a time when Pauper Asylums were being constructed nationwide. It was designed by Joseph Potter in the style of a Georgian mansion at a cost of £35,000. It was initially large enough to hold 120 patients but between 1879 and 1884 two extra wings were added. This included workshops and bakeries bringing capacity to just under 1,000. The lauded James Wilkes who was medical superintendent of the asylum from 1841 - 1855 said this about conditions before he arrived at his post. 'Previous to the year 1841, mechanical restraints were part of the system of treatment habitually employed. In need of a makeover: The asylum is now set to be transformed into 102 apartments. Parts of the building will have to be demolished as they are beyond repair but the main structure is to be converted into the apartments. The project is planned for completion by early 2017 .

An eerie exterior: The imposing asylum looms over a site in Stafford in the West Midlands. It will soon undergo a major makeover project . Back in the day: Taken in 1992, this picture show what the asylum looked like before falling into disrepair. It closed three years later in 1995 . 'The means of restraint employed were the leather muff and wrist straps, iron handcuffs, long leather sleeves, hobbles for the legs, the restraint chair and various other devices. 'Many of them were employed day and night. In addition many of the patients were confined to their beds by means of straps passing through iron loops. 'The evil of this system was perpetuated by high windows protected by iron guards and strongly guarded fireplaces which gave a gloomy prison like aspect to the interior of the building. 'Above all it was evident that the system adopted had a natural and inevitable tendency to demoralise if not to brutalize the attendants.' The hospital shut its doors in 1995 and 145 long-term patients who still lived at the asylum were re-located into the surrounding community. The means of restraint employed were the leather muff and wrist straps, iron handcuffs, long leather sleeves, hobbles for the legs, the restraint chair and various other devices, according to James Wilkes who was medical superintendent of the asylum from 1841-1855 .

"This is the university equality officer at the centre of a sexism and racism row pictured in front of a 'no white men' sign showing  their tears dripping into a cup. A picture of Bahar Mustafa, 27, student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University in London, pretending to cry was posted online  as she was being accused of discrimination. The handmade poster also refers to a ban on 'cis' or cisgender men, a term used of those whose mental gender and physical sex match, which is the opposite of transgender. Message: This picture of Bahar Mustafa, the student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University, shows her posing in front if a 'no white men' sign while pretending to cry . Row: Ms Mustafa appeared to ban men and white people from attending the meeting in this Facebook post . The photograph first appeared on Miss Mustafa's Facebook profile on Tuesday, six days after she told white people and men 'not to come' to a meeting she was organising to discuss 'diversifying the curriculum'. She wrote on Facebook last week: ‘Invite loads of BME [black and minority ethnic] Women and non-binary people!! Also, if you’ve been invited and you’re a man and/or white PLEASE DON’T COME just cos i invited a bunch of people and hope you will be responsible enough to respect this is a BME Women and non-binary event only.’ Non-binary is a term used to describe people who do not consider themselves exclusively male or female. Miss Mustafa, 27, added: ‘Don’t worry lads we will give you and allies things to do’, followed by a wink. The event’s online page said it was open to ‘self-defining BLACK and ETHNIC MINORITY women and non-binary people with gender identities that include “woman”.’ A notice about the meeting later appeared to show the ban had been dropped, stating: 'Allies now welcome!' Miss Mustafa, pictured at a demonstration, describes herself as a ‘queer, anti-racist feminist killjoy’ and previously organised a 'BME ONLY social’ before showing the film Dear White People . The post was met with outrage by students of the university, one of whom described the exclusive policy as 'patronising beyond belief'. The story was covered by student newspaper The Tab just hours after Miss Mustafa first posted the image. Goldsmiths' union eventually backed down after a backlash from students. The ban on men and white students is surprising, since the organisers claim to promote ‘zero tolerance’ for ‘all forms of prejudice, discrimination and oppression’. A senior union member told student newspaper The Tab that Miss Mustafa’s actions had made it ‘very difficult’ for male students. In the hours after the story made national news yesterday, a friend of Miss Mustafa again posted the picture of her pretending to cry to Facebook. He wrote: 'When you thought the cup in the picture was big enough for white tears'. In February, Miss Mustafa, whose Twitter biography says she is ‘queer, anti-racist feminist killjoy’, also organised a 'BME ONLY social’ before showing the film Dear White People. Today her friends posted supportive messages on her Facebook page and also offered her a place to stay if she needed it. But not everyone was so supportive. One Facebook friend, called Jessie, wrote: 'You do not speak for me. I voted you into the position of Welfare and Diversity Officer. 'Your passion is inspiring. But I can't defend this. We cannot best ""them"" by being them. We cannot demand to be included by excluding. 'To specifically exclude a group of people from any event is to become the oppressor. As the oppressed, we should not wish to inflict upon others that pain which we know to be harmful to us. 'This is not the Goldsmiths I love'. Bahar Mustafa, student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University in London, sparked anger when she banned men and white people from a 'diversity' meeting . Graduate: Miss Mustafa recently completed an MA in gender and media studies and won election to become the union's Welfare and Diversity Officer . Miss Mustafa recently graduated from Goldsmiths with an MA in gender and media studies. Criticism: Critics have said that Miss Mustafa’s actions had made it ‘very difficult’ for male students but friends have also defended her . She is understood to live with her mother Nursen, 55, father Ismail, 57, and sister Ipek, 23, in Enfield in a £450,000 three-bedroom terrace. The Daily Mail tried to contact Miss Mustafa but she was not available to explain the comments apparently posted from her Facebook account. A friend told MailOnline  she 'does not want to talk to you'. Yesterday a spokesman for Goldsmiths said the university had no part in the decisions of the union, adding: ‘We are proud of our diverse community and do not tolerate any form of oppression, including racism, sexism or any other form of bigotry. ‘We have written to the students’ union to express our concern.’ The union said: ‘Goldsmiths Students’ Union places huge importance on equality and diversity. ‘It is in this vein that we host spaces where specific minority groups who experience similar discrimination can talk together confidently about overcoming the structural disadvantages and prejudice they face. ‘The accusation that we discriminate is one we refute wholeheartedly'. Goldsmiths has insisted the Student Union is a separate organisation over which it has no control ."
"New figures show the total number of teachers across Scotland has risen, but 12 council areas saw numbers fall.
Mr Swinney said the stats were ""good news"" in light of recruitment ""challenges"" in some areas.
Opposition parties said numbers were still down over the long term.
And they said parents ""have a right to be very angry"" about the attainment gap between pupils from better and worse-off backgrounds.
The latest figures showed teacher numbers were up for the first time in several years, with 51,000 employed in state schools in 2016.
But in 12 local authorities the numbers fell, with the largest percentage drop in Moray, which has highlighted recruitment problems in the past.
The figures were among a fresh batch of important statistics being published on the state of the Scottish education system.
The ratio of pupils to teachers was maintained across Scotland but the average size of a class crept up slightly to 23.5 students.
Nationally, the number of teachers fell between 2010 and 2014 then stabilised.
The number of teachers fell in 12 council areas, including in Highland and Dumfries and Galloway, although in both these regions the ratio of pupils to teachers was maintained at the same level.
In 12 council areas the ratio of pupils to teachers got worse in 2016, including in Edinburgh and Fife where teacher numbers had risen. These were:
The government expects the ratio of pupils to teachers to be maintained, although BBC Scotland understands the councils will not face any financial sanctions.
Many councils have told BBC Scotland that they are finding it hard to fill some vacancies.
Recently the Scottish government unveiled a number of initiatives to try to encourage more people into teaching, and some local authorities have also launched their own initiatives.
The latest statistics also showed:
Separate figures, published on Tuesday, looked at the number of children considered by teachers to be performing at the required level for their age in Curriculum for Excellence.
The data showed that between 65% and 85% of pupils in primary schools achieved the relevant level in aspects of literacy and numeracy. However, the proportion of pupils achieving the relevant level for their stage decreased throughout the primary stages.
Updating MSPs on the figures, Mr Swinney said: ""I very much welcome the rise in teacher numbers compared to last year, the fact that class sizes are broadly stable and that the pupil-teacher ratio has been maintained.
""This is all good news, particularly when you consider the teacher recruitment challenges being faced in some areas.
""The data shows that significant improvements are required in some local authorities, and real challenges exist in delivering the progress in literacy and numeracy we seek.
""There is much to be proud of in Scottish education; we need to remain focused on and committed to Curriculum for Excellence and we need to continue to implement the reforms we are putting in place.""
Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, welcomed the rise in teacher numbers but said some ""significant challenges"" continued to face schools.
General secretary Larry Flanagan said: ""The number of teachers employed across Scotland has held steady, and actually shows a small increase overall, indicating the local authorities have adhered to a commitment brokered between the EIS and local and national government to maintain teacher numbers over the year.
""This is very welcome, and is helping to improve employment prospects for qualified teachers and ensure that young people have consistent levels of provision in schools across Scotland.
""The EIS would certainly expect the Scottish government to continue its commitment to maintaining teacher numbers, and we hope to hear confirmation soon from the finance minister in his forthcoming financial statement.""
He added: ""Given the welcome Scottish government commitment to tackling the attainment gap, the trend of rising class sizes is an issue that must be tackled through greater investment in a greater number of qualified teachers.""
The Scottish Conservatives said teacher numbers were still thousands below the levels they were at in 2007.
The party's education spokeswoman Liz Smith said: ""With teacher numbers having plummeted from the levels they were at a decade ago, it once again calls into question whether the CfE can be delivered properly.
""There are a number of legitimate concerns about the curriculum, and these statistics are further evidence that we need to have proper independent scrutiny of how it is being implemented.""
Ms Smith also told Mr Swinney that parents ""have a right to be very angry"" about the gulf in achievement between pupils from differing financial circumstances.
The Scottish Greens' education spokesman Ross Greer questioned the government's decision to publish statistics on how well schools pupils were doing in certain areas of the Curriculum for Excellence.
He said: ""Today's figures demonstrate the utterly bizarre education priorities the Scottish government has. We see class sizes continue to creep up, making them the highest they've been since the SNP formed the government and nine years after they promised to reduce them to 18.
""More teachers and smaller classes are vital if we're to improve the quality of education.""
Meanwhile, Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale accused the SNP of ""slashing"" spending on Scotland's school pupils by more than 8%.
She highlighted analysis by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) which she said showed that real-terms spend on education fell from Â£6,692-per-pupil in 2010/11 to Â£6,152 in 2014-15.
She said: ""Nicola Sturgeon promised to make education her top priority, but Scotland has plunged down the international league tables on her watch.
""Year-on-year cuts to school budgets, teacher numbers and support staff are damaging the life chances of Scotland's children.""
Scottish Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Tavish Scott MSP said: ""Today's figures show that after a decade in power, the SNP has failed to deliver on its commitment of smaller class sizes for our youngest pupils.""
The latest figures a week after it emerged that Scotland's schools had recorded their worst-ever performance in an international survey of pupils.
The country's scores for maths, reading and science all declined in the latest set of Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) figures.
It was the first time since the tests began in 2000 that Scotland's performance in all three subject areas was classed as ""average"", with none ""above average"", among the 72 countries that took part.
The Curriculum for Excellence has been introduced in Scottish schools in recent years, with the country's qualifications system also overhauled.
However, teaching unions have complained about ""excessive and unsustainable"" workloads as a result of some of the changes."
"The BBC has been accused of launching a Left-wing stitch-up on David Cameron after the Conservative party leader was repeatedly interrupted while trying to answer questions on Radio 1.

The Prime Minister was consistently interrupted while trying to answer questions on the Live Lounge programme, with some Twitter users branding it 'disgusting' At one point, the Prime Minister was asked to rule out a deal with Northern Ireland’s DUP because of its policies towards lesbian and gay people. Mr Cameron said he did not want a coalition with anybody and insisted he could win a majority – prompting Mr Smith to insist be forced into coalition. Clearly irritated, the Prime Minister replied: ‘You seem to know the outcome of the election. How do you know. Have you got some God-given right to declare what the result of the election is?’ Mr Smith then said: ‘I bet you a thousand pounds you don’t win a majority.’ The PM insisted: ‘I’m not going to start taking bets but there is every opportunity in the next 15 days for there to be a majority government.’ People used social media to complain about the programme, broadcast this evening, during which many felt like David Cameron got a hostile reaction . Users of social media criticised the presenter as ‘childish’ and ‘arrogant’. ‘Who is this guy? Simply shouldn’t be allowed to present,’ wrote one. Twitter user Calvin Robinson said: 'Wow, that BBC Radio 1 interview of David Cameron is disgusting. Talk about a biased and hostile interviewer, utter contempt from Chris Smith.' Meanwhile Adam Ewies added: 'Cameron ambushed by lefty presenter and audience on Radio 1 tonight, as was Farage with Evans. Lefty BBC has no credibility.' Mr Cameron also clashed with an audience member who accused him of adopting a policy of ‘let them drown’ over migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean. While some complained about the audience and their apparent reluctance to listen to the Prime Minister, others turned their ire on host Chris Smith ."

"Judge Carlos Castro Martins reversed the order he had issued in September, which had barred any work on the Belo Monte dam that interfered with the natural flow of the Xingu river.
He said the company behind the project had subsequently shown its work would not harm local fishing.
The project has been heavily criticised by environmentalists.
Judge Martins had originally ruled in favour of a fisheries group which argued that the dam would affect local fish stocks and could harm indigenous families who make a living from fishing.
He had barred the Norte Energia company behind the project from all work which could interfere with the natural flow of the Xingu river, including building a port, using explosives, installing dikes and building canals.
Legal wrangling
Norte Energia appealed against the decision and Judge Martins ruled on Friday that construction work on the dam could go ahead as the company had shown that local fishing boats would not be blocked or hindered in their work.
""Since the course of the water won't be altered, and there won't be much variation in the speed of its flow, (the project) won't have a major influence on the habitat of ornamental fish species used for fishing,"" he said.
Judge Martins did, however, say that the wider environmental impact of the project ""could only be felt and analysed once the work was completed, as the studies into its effects were only forecasts of what could happen"".
He also said that any work would have to comply with the regulations laid down by Brazil's Indian Affairs Department (Funai) and the National Environment Agency, Ibama.
Norte Energia said the temporary halt on the building work had not affected the project, as it had not yet reached the stage where the company needed to do any of the specific type of work which had fallen under the ban.
If it goes ahead, the 11,000-megawatt dam will be the third biggest in the world - after the Three Gorges in China and Itaipu, which is jointly run by Brazil and Paraguay.
The government says it is crucial to meeting growing energy needs, but environmentalists and those fighting for indigenous rights have been vociferous in their opposition."

"The move is part of Police Scotland's cost-cutting plan to centralise control rooms.
If a decision is taken at a board meeting on 22 March it is thought likely that the centre will close quickly afterwards.
SPA chairman Andrew Flanagan said he had been consulting widely on the move.
He told BBC Scotland: ""I think there are a number of local concerns about the closure. It's important we take account of local concerns.
""We need an assurance it's going to be effective."""
"The moment a pregnant woman was fatally shot by two Idaho police officers has been revealed in surveillance footage. Jeanetta Riley, 35, a mother-of-three daughters was killed last July after she brandished a knife at two cops outside of a hospital in Sandpoint on the evening of July 8, 2014. The troubled Native American woman, who was addicted to meth and alcohol, had been taken to the hospital by her husband, 44-year-old Shane, following threats she made to kill herself, according to the Guardian. While parked outside of the emergency room of Bonner General Hospital, she pulled a knife from under the car seat featuring a three-and-a-half-inch blade, and was confronted by police before she was shot and killed. In the video, Jeanetta is heard in an exchange with officers as they repeatedly tell her to put the knife down but she refuses before a commotion is heard and they shoot her. Jeanetta Riley (pictured left with her husband Shane), 35, a mother-of-three daughters was killed last July after she brandished a knife at two cops outside of a hospital in Sandpoint on the evening of July 8, 2014 . She was taken to hospital by her husband, Shane, after he heard her fiddling with blades and talked about killing herself and stabbing people (Jeanetta pictured above with her daughters Dayna, top, Dolly, left, and Hannah, right) Officers Michael Valenzuela, 27 and Skyler Ziegler, 29 were cleared of any wrongdoing following the incident and the case was closed in November. In the footage, Valenzuela, Ziegler and a third officer, Garrett Johnson, 23 arrived at the scene where Jeanetta was sitting in the car holding the bottle of vodka and the knife. She then walked towards them with the knife at her side, according to the Guardian. In the footage, Ziegler is heard shouting 'walk over here' and 'show me your hands' before she responds 'f*** you. no.' She is told again to put down the knife and continues to refuse and shouts 'bring it on, no.' Jeanetta then steps off the curb and into the road towards the two officers when gun fired is heard, with three bullets striking her torso and one striking her heart. Jeanetta took the knife from under the car seat and was confronted by officers who repeatedly told her to put the knife down but she refused (above scenes from the incident) After she stepped off the curb and walked towards them, they fired their guns and she was killed (above the moment she was shot) The events leading to the incident unfolded when the couple, who was homeless and living out of a 1996 Chevrolet van parked next to a lake, had spent the day with Jeanetta's daughter, 13-year-old Hannah. Jeanetta and Shane had arguments earlier in the day that were escalating when she began mentioning harming herself. The pair dropped Hannah off at her stepfather's house, and after drinking half a bottle of vodka while back at their camp, Jeanetta spoke about killing herself and stabbing people, Shane said. When he heard her fiddling with blades he decided to take her to the hospital. The Native American woman, who was addicted to alcohol and meth, and drank half a bottle of vodka before she was taken to the hospital on the day she died . In the summer of 2012, Jeanetta married Shane and two years later the couple gave up their newborn baby for adoption . Shane said he told Jeanetta at the time: 'This isn't a joke. It's not a game.' While parked outside of the emergency room, Jeanetta took out the knife and Shane ran inside and told a staff member behind the desk to call the police. Following the exchange with police, Jeanetta was shot and killed. Valenzuela told detectives he thought she was 'absolutely gonna thrust at me' when he pulled the trigger, while Ziegler said the knife looked 'huge in her hands', according to the Guardian. In November, the officers were cleared of wrongdoing by a local prosecutor. Fourteen hours after Jeanetta was shot and killed, a dog called Arfee was fatally shot by police in nearby Coeur d’Alene, in a killing that was ruled unjustified. His owner received an $80,000 payout two weeks ago as well as an apology from the mayor. Shane and Riley's three daughters so far have not even received an apology. The officers involved in the incident were cleared of any wrongdoing by a local prosecutor in November. Jeanetta and her husband were homeless and living out of their van which was parked next to a lake . On the day of the incident, Shane ran into the hospital (above) and alerted staff to call the police . Peter Reedy, an FBI-trained hostage negotiator and former sergeant, said the officers should not have gone so quickly into a tense stand-off with their guns drawn, he told the Guardian. He said: 'First of all, do nothing. Keep your distance, try to talk to her, don't even take your gun out of your holster, try to calm things down and work out what you're up against.' Reedy added: 'If they had not responded to the call they way she did, I truly believe she would be alive right now.' There are close to 1,000 people killed by police on average each year, according to a recent U.S. government study, and reportedly at least half of those fatally shot by police in the U.S. have mental health issues, another study reported."
"Eddie Hearn has insisted his £1.5million purse offer to Carl Frampton comes with no strings attached, but efforts to make a super-fight with Scott Quigg remain deadlocked. Hearn unveiled a cheque with his offer to Sky TV cameras in a bid to force a deal with the IBF super-bantamweight champion, as the Matchroom promoter upped the ante in a bid to book a July 18 date at Manchester Arena. However, Frampton’s promoters, Cyclone Promotions, headed by former world champ Barry McGuigan, released a press release in response to the offer, claiming they were awaiting formal communication from Hearn’s Matchroom Sports before renewing negotiations over the much-hyped bout. Eddie Hearn presents the cheque for £1.5m to set-up Scott Quigg's fight with Carl Frampton . Matchroom Sport boss Hearn said the cheque offered 1.5m reasons for the two boxers to fight . Quigg stares down the camera to tell Frampton to 'put his money where his mouth is' TV rights were believed to be a major stumbling block in negotiations as Matchroom are tied to Sky Sports, while Frampton’s recent title defence against Chris Avalos attracted millions of viewers between ITV in the UK and UTV Ireland. Now Hearn has seemingly attempted to force the fight with a big-money offer in the hope that the bout can be screened on Sky Box Office. While past negotiations were believed to have collapsed due to a failure to agree a deal on future promotional ‘options’ on fights, the Matchroom promoter also insisted he has not demanded rights to promote Frampton’s future fights. ‘Nothing at all — no options, no rematch clause, absolutely nothing,’ Hearn told Sportsmail when questioned on whether such terms were included in his £1.5m offer. ‘He can have this fight, he can go back to whatever broadcaster he wants [after it]. He can go and move to the moon if he wants, it’s nothing to do with us.’ Quigg is the defending WBA super-bantamweight champion and wants to fight Frampton in Manchester . Quigg celebrates his win over Hidenori Othake at the Liverpool Echo Arena in November last year . McGuigan declined to comment further on the saga when contacted by Sportsmail, refusing to elaborate on Cyclone Promotions’ statement which said they ‘have made several attempts to organise a follow-up meeting with Eddie Hearn of Matchroom Sport to progress these negotiations’. The Cyclone statement added: ‘If Matchroom Sport are interested in joining Cyclone Promotions in staging this domestic superfight, we recommend Matchroom accept the invitation for a follow-up meeting.’ Hearn countered the Cyclone statement, telling Sportsmail: ‘We just want to get it done, it’s so frustrating… I know their statement said we turned down another meeting but that’s because it was getting nowhere. We’re trying to make things happen. ‘The only thing that Cyclone Promotions want is they want to co-promote the show. We’re bringing all the money, we’re putting all the money up,’ said the Matchroom promoter. ‘If there was another broadcaster that they were willing to work with, who could throw a load of money at this fight, then make us an offer. They can’t. We’re in such a strong position, but we’re still being fair. Scott Quigg is the one taking all the risk here. If it doesn’t do that great at the box office, Scott might get only £400-500,000 and Carl still gets his £1.5m, there is no risk. 'This is the offer that I believe has to make Carl Frampton say yes. I’ve already responded [to Cyclone] to say “if you want to co-promote, co-promote it”,’ added Hearn. Frampton lands a punch on American opponent Chris Avalos during their fight last month . Frampton celebrates after his win over Spain's Kiko Martinez in September last year ."
"No-one is absolutely certain it will happen, but most people I've spoken to assume it's coming.
In reality, the Americans will just tell everyone what they want and when they want it. I'm told that European governments don't get much say in the matter or much notice of any changes - in fact they're watching the media and Twitter just in case it's sprung on them.
Any ban would hit Heathrow the hardest. Three-quarters of UK flights to the US go from Heathrow. That's 761 planes a week, by far the most from any European airport.
However, there is widespread concern that by tackling one threat, terrorism, the Americans could be fuelling another, even more serious problem. Fire.
If lithium-ion batteries are damaged or short-circuited they make a hell of a bang.
It could even be enough to bring down a plane.
Captain John Cox is as knowledgeable as anyone you will meet when it comes to plane fires. The former pilot and member of the Royal Aeronautical Society has studied them for more than a decade and now travels the world advising operators, manufacturers and regulators.
""Bunching lots of electronic devices together into the same secure box in the hold is the worst possible thing you could do,"" he told me. ""Devices collected together will dramatically increase the ferocity of any fire.""
Aircraft holds do have fire extinguishers and limited oxygen, but that doesn't help when it comes to lithium battery fires.
""The cargo hold extinguisher will put out the open flame but it will reignite. Lithium battery fires produce their own oxygen as a by-product of thermal runaway, and that keeps the fire going,"" says Mr Cox.
Thermal runaway is the process whereby the fire spreads from one battery cell to the next. Once it gets going it's impossible to stop.
And the more cells you have bunched together, the bigger the fire.
Catching the fire early and stopping thermal runaway is critical. The best device for doing that remains an old fashioned, well-trained human being.
Airline staff practise what to do: you put the battery into water if you can. Or wet towels. No-one can do that if it's in the hold.
Steve Landells is the safety expert at the British Airline Pilots Association,
""Given the risk of fire from these devices when they are damaged or they short circuit, an incident in the cabin would be spotted earlier and this would enable the crew to react quickly before any fire becomes uncontainable,"" he says.
""If these devices are kept in the hold, the risk is that if a fire occurs the results can be catastrophic; indeed, there have been two crashes where lithium batteries have been cited in the accident reports.""
Mr Cox says that balancing the different risks is complex and needs a thorough assessment from a range of experts. But along with many others in the industry, he's not confident that will happen.
The feeling is that the people at the US Department for Homeland Security will take their decision in isolation from the safety people at the US Federation Aviation Administration.
That's what happened when the current laptop ban on some flights from the Middle East was brought in.
Passengers will no doubt support a ban if they are convinced it'll keep them safer.
But the experts are lining up to say that a laptop ban could make flying more dangerous."

"A cat has been freed after spending 27 days trapped under a bath tub, it has been revealed. Simba was rescued by firefighters in Meckenheim, near Bonn, Germany, after a neighbour heard scratching in her newly refitted bathroom. Owners Helga and Eberhard Henkel had lost their pet in early March and had looked everywhere - even hanging up notices in surrounding streets. Lucky escape: Simba the cat was freed by firefigthers after spending 27 days trapped under a bath tub . Pet rescue: It is thought the animal had crawled under the floor boards as the bathroom was being renovated . But nearly four weeks later, a neighbour  raised the alarm after hearing noises from under the bath. It is thought the animal had crawled under the floor as the bathroom was being renovated. According to The Local, Mrs Henkel told a local newspaper: 'It's a miracle, a gift. 'We looked everywhere for Simba, hung up notices, watched out for cats' eyes with a torch at night.' She said that Simba was showing the effects of not having eaten for four weeks - but that he had put back on 300 grammes. Owners Helga and Eberhard Henkel (pictured with Simba) had lost their pet in early March and had looked everywhere - even hanging up notices in surrounding streets . On the mend: Although Simba was 'traumatised' by his experience, he is quickly recovering and has put back on 300 grammes . 'He is skin and bones. You feel all the ribs, the backbone, Simba has fallen sharply and is traumatised,' Die Welt quotes her as saying. The Local quotes Professor Neigel an animal expert from Giessen, Germany, as saying cats were capable of surviving for long periods on only a small amount of water. He said that a month was still a long time for a cat to survive, but that it was not 'out of the ordinary'."

Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths praised Rodgers for his ""exceptional"" man-management skills, adding: ""he's different to what I've had before.
""He's very straight down the line. He tells you why you're not playing. His attention to detail in everything we do [was evident] from the first day he came in.
""We have progressed as a team and grown in stature and we're showing everyone what we're all about now. The only way we're going to go is forward.""
Griffiths added: ""If I had to choose one of the other three, I'd go for Alan Archibald.

"Pablo Osvaldo has urged Italian legends Andrea Pirlo and Francisco Totti to move continents and join him at Argentinian giants Boca Juniors. The 29-year-old moved to his current side on a loan deal from Southampton and has become an instant hit - scoring three goals in six games. Osvaldo believes that the duo would be a good fit for Boca, and says the fans would love to have them line up on the La Bombonera pitch. Pablo Osvaldo thinks that his former team-mates Andrea Pirlo and Francesco Totti should move to Boca . 'Who I would like to join me at Boca? Pirlo and Totti,' the 29-year-old told Corriere dello Sport. 'I have played with many great players over the years and many of them are my friends. I don't want to do injustice to anyone, but if I had to pick two, it would be Pirlo and Totti. 'They have a bit of a South-American style and they would be perfect for Boca with their abilities. 'The Bombonera would go absolutely crazy for players like them.' Pirlo has established himself as one of the best midfielders in world football and is hugely popular . Totti (10) is a Roma legend and Osvaldo feels that he would be just as loved if he moved to Argentina ."

"The Manchester derby will be more like El Clasico, with 14 native Spanish-speaking players due to be involved. Eight of United’s first-team squad and six from City are from Spain or Spanish-speaking countries. They are David de Gea, Victor Valdes, Juan Mata, Ander Herrera (all Spain), Marcos Rojo, Angel di Maria (both Argentina), Antonio Valencia (Ecuador) and Falcao (Colombia) at United, and Willy Caballero, Pablo Zabaleta, Martin Demichelis, Sergio Aguero (all Argentina), Jesus Navas and David Silva (both Spain) at City. Sergio Aguero will be one of 14 native Spanish-speaking players to feature in the Manchester derby on Sunday . United captain Wayne Rooney (centre) is likely to be just one of nine English-speakers to feature on Sunday . Nine English-speakers are expected to be in the two sides’ respective 18-man squads including England internationals Phil Jones, Michael Carrick, Ashley Young, Wayne Rooney, Joe Hart, James Milner as well as Frank Lampard. Both clubs pride themselves on bringing through their own products. However, when Sir Alex arrived at Old Trafford he was disgusted to learn that City scooped the cream of Manchester's talent and quickly (and successfully) set about putting that right. A generation such as the Class of '92 is unlikely to be seen again, but the derby could see no Mancunians in either squad for the second time in a row. Sir Alex Ferguson was disgusted that City's youth academy was more profitable on arrival at United . Along with Ferguson, Eric Harrison (left) brought through the Class of 92, to include Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Terry Cooke . For three years, after the departure of Wes Brown to Sunderland, Danny Welbeck flew the Manchester flag. But following the Longsight lad's move to Arsenal, November's first instalment at the Etihad Stadium saw not one hometown native in either squad for the first time in living memory. Rooney was only born 30 miles down the road but he may as well be from another planet as far as many from this neck of the woods are concerned. Unless Tyler Blackett can stun the football world and force his way into Louis van Gaal's United line-up, it will be a Manc-free derby. Unless Tyler Blackett (centre) makes a comeback for United there won't be any local lads in the two XIs ."
"Javier Hernandez made it six goals in eight starts as Real Madrid kept up their pursuit of Barcelona at the top of La Liga with a 4-2 win over Celta Vigo. Chicharito is currently scoring a goal every 83 minutes with a scoring ratio that is only two minutes short of Lionel Messi who nets once every 81 minutes. The Manchester United loanee put his team in the Champions League semi-finals in midweek with the winner against Atletico Madrid and in Baliados on Sunday night he scored twice to keep Real in the title race. READ PETE JENSON'S FULL MATCH REPORT HERE . Host commentator . Real Madrid are now just two points behind league leaders Barcelona. Chelsea may have wrapped up the title in England but it seems like the La Liga race will go right down to the wire. Real Madrid will have Hernandez to thanks for tonight's win as his two goals were decisive in their win over Celta. The home side the better side for large stages throughout the game but Real's quality in the final third made the difference. Yet another sign of respect by Ancelotti towards Celta. The Italian tactician now has six defenders on the pitch following the arrival of Arbeloa. Real Madrid now have three at the back with Carvajal and Marcelo acting as wing backs. Ancelotti's tactical switch shows just how much of a threat Celta have been during the 80-odd minutes or so. Hernandez will not get the chance of scoring a hat-trick as Ancelotti has decided to take the Mexican off. Pepe has been brought on to shore up the back-line. It's that man Hernandez again. Sergio Ramos runs up the pitch before playing a delightful through pass to Hernandez with the outside of his foot. The Mexican then takes one touch to bring the ball down before placing the ball into the net. A fine goal by the Real Madrid loanee. Some great football being played by Celta - and remember their wage bill is €12m compared with the €17m Real pay Ronaldo. But they are inevitably leaving themselves wide open on the counter. An equaliser doesn't look far off as Real fail to get to grips with Celta. The away side continue to counter attack with Hernandez going close after a neat run from the halfway line. Real Madrid are playing with fire. The home side should have been given a penalty as Kroos has just swiped the legs of Orellana, who was racing towards goal. Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti may have to freshen his side up during the next 10 minutes or so. They are still look far from convincing. Here's a reminder of who the Italian tactician can call on from the bench. Real Madrid subs: Navas, Pepe, Coentrao, Lucas Silva, Arbeloa, Nacho, Jese . Ronaldo has always scored against Celta Vigo whenever he has faced the La Liga outfit while wearing a Real Madrid shirt. He will be desperate to add to his outstanding tally of 39 league goals. No Bale and Benzema, no problem - Chicharito and James Rodriguez very good in the first half. Celta still in it but to play that well in the first 45 minutes and to go in at half time losing, it will be hard to lift themselves again. Real Madrid are extremely fortunate to be winning this game. Celta have looked assured and have really troubled their opponent's back-line. Nolito opened the scoring before Real took the lead thanks to goals by Toni Kroos and Javier Hernandez. Celta looked to be heading into the interval on level terms after Santi Mina's goal, however James Rodriguez struck before the break to make it 3-2 to Real. Real Madrid's luck appears to be in tonight as James Rodriguez has just scored an extremely fortunate goal. His shot is heading towards the arms of Sergio, in the Celta goal, until his shot deflects into the opposite corner and lands in the back of the net. Real do not deserve to be winning this game. Ronaldo almost puts his side back in the lead. The Portuguese forward races past Celta's defence before unleashing a low shot which looks destined to be heading for the back of the net. However his left-footed drives smashes against the post and rebounds to a Celta player. Remains 2-2. Barcelona will be delighted with the scoreline and Celta Vigo's performance during the opening 40 minutes of tonight's game. The home side continue to look the better side but they must be wary of Real's threat on the counter-attack. Real appear to be struggling in the absence of two members of the famous 'BBC' trio. They seem to be missing the pace of both Bale and Benzema in the final third. Not just because he's just scored, and not just because he scored four in one game two weeks ago, but 19-year-old Santi Mina is going to be one hell of a player. What is going on here? Just as we think Real are starting to find second gear - Celta go and grab an equaliser. This time it is Santi Mina who beats Casillas. He smashes the ball against the woodwork before tapping in the rebound from close range. One man who does seem to have taken confidence from the win over Atletico id Hernandez. He may have had to make do with a place on the bench during the majority of the season but he is now showing his worth. Hernandez shows a burst of pace before finishing past Sergio. I expected Real to come into this match with an extra bounce in their step following their win over Atletico but it has been the complete opposite. They look rattled and have really struggled during the opening 20 minutes of tonight's match. Second big assist in a week from Ronaldo. He's after his 40th league goal tonight. Celta have scored 38 as a team - that's what they are up against. It didn't take long for Real to get back on level terms. Ronaldo goes on a dangerous run down the right but fails to pick out a Real Madrid team-mate. The ball eventually falls to Kroos, who has the easy task of side-footing the ball into the net. Game on. Celta Vigo, who have started the brighter of the two sides, score by hitting Real on the counter attack. Nolito bursts down the left before cutting in between two defenders and shooting low past Iker Casillas. Fully deserved lead for the home side. Bright enough start from Celta. Ancelotti has not won here in any of his previous three visits with three different teams - Juventus, Milan and Madrid last season. Celta have started the match brightly with Real having to sit back and deal with their opponent's attacking threat. It looks like they will not be afraid of the European champions which should make for a good spectacle. Evidence shows that Real Madrid have a better win percentage without their Welsh wizard. Read Ben Nagle's piece on Bale's impact HERE. Manchester United's Javier Hernandez will lead the line for Real Madrid due to the absence of Karim Benzema. The Mexican international will be high in confidence following his late winner in the Champions League against rivals Atletico. Real Madrid XI: Casillas, Carvajal, Varane, Ramos, Marcelo, Kroos, Illarramendi, Isco, Rodriguez, Hernandez, Ronaldo . Real Madrid subs: Navas, Pepe, Coentrao, Lucas Silva, Arbeloa, Nacho, Jese . Celta Vigo XI: Sergio, Hugo Mallo, Cabral, Fontas, Jonny, Augusto, Krohn-Dehli, Orellana, Santi Mina, Nolito, Larrivey . Attention switches from the Barclays Premier League to the La Liga title race as Real Madrid face Celta Vigo at Balaidos in tonight's evening kick-off. The European champions will be desperate to claim all three points in order to pile pressure on rivals Barcelona. Carlo Ancelotti's side will have to make do without the injured Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Luka Modric. Real Madrid will be hoping to follow up their late Champions League triumph against rivals Atletico Madrid by picking up all three points against mid-table Celta Vigo. League leaders Barcelona piled pressure on Real by defeating Espanyol 2-0, to leave the Catalan giants five points clear at the top of the table. Carlo Ancelotti will have to make do without the injured Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Luka Modric for Sunday evening's encounter at Balaidos, however the Italian tactician will be able to call on the services of a rejuvenated Javier Hernandez."

"Belly flop to belly up?  It’s fair to say Steve Bruce has had better weeks than this one, which featured the publication of some poolside diving snaps and culminated in a defeat that suggests Hull might yet bomb out of the Premier League. This was a game they could not afford to lose. Not when their final seven games include fixtures against Southampton, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United. But lose they did, bringing their winless run to five and leaving themselves in a right mess. Bafetimbi Gomis roars with celebration after giving Swansea a 2-0 lead against Hull at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday . Gomis unleashed a thunderous overhead kick shortly before half-time to capitalise on some poor Hull defending . The French striker fires a spectacular volley past Allan McGregor and into the roof of the Hull net to double the home side's lead . The Swansea striker celebrates his strike in front of a group of young supporters after doubling his side's lead in the first half . Swansea (4-3-3): Fabianski 6.5; Naughton 6 (Rangel 56, 6), Fernandez 6.5, Williams 7, Taylor 7; Ki 7, Cork 6.5 (Dyer 65, 6), Shelvey 6.5 (Grimes 90); Sigurdsson 6.5, Gomis 7.5, Routledge 6.5 .

Bafetimbi Gomis scored a spectacular overhead. CLICK HERE for more match zone . True, they could have benefited more from refereeing decisions – Bafetimbi Gomis was offside in the build up to his brilliant first goal and David Meyler’s second-half red card could have gone either way – but that should not exonerate a side that is supposed to be fighting for it life and yet looked so meek for half of this match. They managed no shots on goal in the time it took Swansea to go 2-0 ahead through Ki Sung-Yueng and Gomis’s bicycle kick. And it was only in the second half that they mounted a challenge. As fate would have it, Meyler was sent off for fouling Kyle Naughton two minutes after Paul McShane had given Hull a lifeline. Gomis finished them in stoppage time. Bruce was exasperated. He said: ‘We were disappointed to lose the game and we knew we were nowhere near good enough in the first-half in particular. ‘But the two big decisions went against us and they could have turned the game. Gomis’ first goal is a fantastic piece of skill but he is five yards offside. Gomis grabbed his second of the match after racing on to Jonjo Shelvey's pass and chipping McGregor in injury time . The 29-year-old celebrates in front of the Swansea fans on his hands and knees after making sure of the three points . Paul McShane pulled a goal back for Hull five minutes into the second half when he pounced in the six-yard box . The Hull defender slotted past Lukasz Fabianski from just four yard out after latching onto a free kick totally unmarked . ‘We had got back into the game at 2-1 but unfortunately David has picked up a red card. I’ve seen it six times now and from three angles and to me it’s a perfectly decent challenge. ‘The other three I look at it and he takes part of the ball and the leg collides with the boy. We may as well say with these grey areas that you are not allowed to tackle if you tackle on the floor.’ The consequence of the challenge, beyond damage to Hull’s survival prospects, is that Naughton went to hospital for an X-ray on his ankle. Garry Monk said: ‘His ankle is really swollen. That is the real negative. We hope it is not serious. At the time I thought it was a genuine 50-50 challenge. My initial reaction was “bad challenge” but I don’t think there was any malice. You run that risk if your foot is high and goes over the ball.’ For Monk, it was the only complaint from a match that Swansea probably could have won in third gear. That’s no exaggeration in the context of how poor Hull were in the opening 45 minutes. For a team in that kind of mess, with those fixtures still to come, it was incomprehensible. That’s not to say Swansea stormed from the blocks. Ki’s opener after 18 minutes was actually the first chance of the game. Jonjo Shelvey had taken his usual punt from distance and while Allan McGregor did well to get down and save, his parry fell squarely at the feet of the South Korean. David Meyler was sent off for the visitors just three minutes after McShane pulled a goal back for a lunge on Kyle Naughton . Hull midfielder Meyler and his team-mates look on in disbelief as Andre Mariner reaches for the red card . Swansea right back Naughton limps from the field and has to be replaced by Angel Rangel following Meyler's tackle . Ki buried the finish without taking a touch and now has scored four goals in eight games. With seven this season, the deep-lying midfielder has become a delightfully complete player. It took 24 minutes for Hull to have their first chance – Abel Hernandez hit a bouncing ball from 30 yards and it trickled all the way to Lukasz Fabianski. It wasn’t even on target. The rest of their attacks fizzled, a side with five across the middle seemingly incapable of holding possession. Gomis nailed the second with a goal that was hardly at home in such a subdued game. It really was a beautiful finish. Kyle Naughton delivered a ball into the area, Michael Dawson attempted to head clear and the striker buried a bicycle kick. Replays showed he had come back from an offside position, but the finish was magnificent. At that stage, Hull appeared out of it. Monk warned his side of complacency at the break and, in his words, ‘they did the total opposite’. It enabled Hull to pull one back after 49 minutes. Ashley Williams had tangled with Dame N’Doye and conceded a free-kick which Robbie Brady delivered from the right. Alex Bruce found space from six yards to flick a header at goal and McShane poked a finish past Fabianski. For two minutes Hull looked a genuine threat. And then, just as quickly, hope was gone. Meyler went high on Naughton and will miss the next three games. Ki Sung-Yueng opened the scoring for the home side inside 20 minutes after pouncing following an Allan McGregor save . Ki leads the celebrations after giving Garry Monk's side an early advantage at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday . Hull, to their credit, did not give up. But it was in their desperation for a leveller that they conceded a third. Nathan Dyer dispossessed Brady and Sigurdsson sent a long ball to Gomis. With none of Hull’s outfield players in their own half, the Frenchman had time to think before a nice chip over McGregor. In this strange old season of moans and a feint, he has also made his way to eight goals in all competitions. It will be interesting to see if his improved recent form has soothed some of the anger caused by his January agitations. It will be more interesting in the shorter term to see if Hull can find the significant improvement needed to get themselves out of this hole."
"His neighbors wouldn't let him build a film studio. So George Lucas is retaliating in a way that only the cream of Hollywood could - by building the largest affordable housing development in the area. The complex of affordable housing, funded and designed by the Star Wars director, would provide homes to 224 low-income families. And there's very little his fellow Bay Area residents can do about it. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Making waves: George Lucas has unveiled plans to build an affordable housing complex on the plot of land in Lucas Valley, Bay Area, which his neighbors are determined to leave untouched . Lucas dropped plans for a Lucasfilm Ltd studio complex on Lucas Valley Road in 2012. Citing opposition from neighbors, a spokesman said they did not want to be seen as an 'evil empire'. But it seems the award-winning director is determined to do something with the 1,039 acres of land on his Grady Ranch estate in Marin County, California. The project, submitted for planning on Wednesday, would span 52 acres and cost around $200m. Just a few meters from his own Skywalker Ranch, the community would consist of two complexes. One would contain 120 two-bedroom and three-bedroom homes for low-income families. The other would be for pensioners: a four-story building with 104 one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments. Because Lucas proposes to fund the project himself, his lawyers say he has the right to select who lives there. However, his representatives insist the project is not a form of retaliation. 'He said ""we've got enough millionaires here. What we need is some houses for regular working people"",' his lawyer Gary Giacomini told CBS. Scrapped: This was a rendering of the film studio that Lucas planned to build on the estate but was overruled . Idyllic: The 224-home community would be built in this idyllic spot of California for low-income families . Marin County Supervisor Steve Kinsey told the station: 'George Lucas said, ""if I’m not going to do what I wanted to do there, what can I do that would be really beneficial to this community?""' It is not the first time Lucas has courted controversy. In November 2014, residents of Chicago filed a lawsuit against Lucas' plans to build a museum along the shore of Lake Michigan. The case was a major blow to the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, a shrine his collection of art and movie memorabilia, after negotiations over a waterfront site fell through with San Francisco."

Pellegrini reiterated his stance that he is not fearful about losing his job but admitted his team have extra motivation ahead of Sunday's game. 'I think the first motivation is always to win,' he said. 'Being a derby against a team like United that dominated the league for so many years, it's more.

"Charged with four offences: Sunderland footballer Adam Johnson arrives to answer bail at Peterlee police station in County Durham yesterday . An England footballer was yesterday charged with grooming and sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. Adam Johnson, 27, who plays in the Premier League for Sunderland and has represented his country 12 times, faces a lengthy jail term if he is convicted. The £10million winger was arrested seven weeks ago and learnt his fate during an arranged appointment at Peterlee police station, Durham. Johnson, the father of a three-month-old daughter, has been accused of three offences of sexual activity with a child under 16 and one of grooming. The £50,000-a-week player is due to appear before Peterlee magistrates on May 20 and the case will then be transferred to crown court. His team is playing Arsenal away that evening in the penultimate game of their league battle against relegation. The case threatens to put an end to the talented attacker’s glittering career. Last night, it was not clear if he will be allowed to continue playing before his case is dealt with. Gerry Wareham, of the Crown Prosecution Service, announced the decision to charge Johnson. He said it was in the public interest to charge the footballer and there was a ‘realistic prospect’ of a conviction. Johnson was told of the charges he will face during a 20-minute meeting with detectives. Dressed in a navy tracksuit and white trainers, he emerged grim-faced and walked swiftly out of the police station without commenting before being driven away. He stands accused of three offences of sexual activity with a child, contrary to Section 9 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The offences are said to have taken place between December 30 last year and February 26. He has also been charged with meeting a child following sexual grooming under Section 15 of the Act. Johnson was arrested on March 2 at his six-bedroom, £1.9million home in Castle Eden, near Hartlepool. Court date: Premier League winger Johnson (centre) will appear at Peterlee Magistrates’ Court on May 20 . Winger: Johnson (left, with long-time girlfriend Stacey Flounders, and right, in a match against Newcastle United on April 5) has made 31 appearances for Sunderland this season, scoring five goals . He became a father for the first time on January 8 when his girlfriend Stacey Flounders, 25, gave birth to their daughter Ayla Sofia. The alleged sexual activity offences cover a period while she was pregnant and after she gave birth. Johnson was born in Sunderland and raised in Easington, County Durham, before joining Middlesbrough’s youth academy as a 12-year-old. He made his Premier League debut for the club in 2005 and was sold in 2010 to Manchester City. Sunderland signed him for £10million in 2012. Initially the player was suspended after his arrest. But two weeks later, he was allowed back to training and returned to the team under Sunderland’s new manager Dick Advocaat. Home: The Premier League winger was arrested at his mansion (pictured) in County Durham on March 2 . Former Middlesbrough star: Adam Johnson has represented England at senior level 12 times . Adam Johnson began his career at Middlesbrough, where he made his debut in a Uefa Cup game in 2005, aged just 17. Almost six months later, he turned out for the first time in the Premier League, taking part in a 2-1 home win against Arsenal. He was loaned out to Leeds United then Watford, scoring 12 goals in his three-month stay at the Hertfordshire club. On his return to Middlesbrough, he again showed strong form, then made a £7million move to Manchester City in February 2010. In three seasons at the Etihad Stadium, the speedy winger made 97 appearances, helping win the Barclays Premier League, FA Cup and Community Shield. In August 2012 he moved back to his native North East, to Sunderland, in a £10million deal, and highlights of his time there have included a hat-trick on January 11 last year in a 4-1 away win over Fulham. He said after taking the match ball as a memento: ‘These days don't come along too often unless you're Messi or Ronaldo, so it was nice for me to get that ball as a souvenir to look back on. ‘This is up there with one of my best days of my career along with playing for England, scoring for England.’ He was awarded the Barclays Player of the Month award that month. The 27-year-old has represented England at under-19 and under-21 level, and at senior level 12 times, the last of them in a friendly victory over Italy in August 2012. He has struggled to reproduce his best form on a sustained basis at Sunderland, but endeared himself to the fans with goals in each of the club's three derby victories at Newcastle in as many seasons, including a late winner at St James' Park on December 21 last year. Derby win: Winger Johnson scored a late winner against Newcastle United at St James' Park last December . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."
"SKYFARING . by Mark Vanhoenacker . (Chatto & Windus £16.99) Our fascination with aeroplanes, and the men who fly them (it is still overwhelmingly men), has acquired a morbid flavour since Germanwings flight 9525 was deliberately crashed into the French Alps by its troubled co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. The tragedy ignited an ongoing debate about stress and depression among pilots, and airline vetting procedures, in which just about all of us have a vested interest. This makes Mark Vanhoenacker’s book, unwittingly, very timely indeed. When he was writing it he had never heard of Lubitz, of course, but nor does he dwell on the horrors of 9/11 or any other plane crashes either accidental or premeditated. Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways, who wants us simply to understand his passion for his job, and to share with us many of its more beguiling secrets. Like me, he was still a child when he was first invited into an aeroplane cockpit, and like me, he regarded it as one of the transcendent treats of his young life. But for him, the mystique endured. It is reassuring, now more than ever, to be reminded that even for experienced pilots air travel can still be an exhilarating, almost magical experience. Mark Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways and he wants the reader to simply understand his passion for his job . Vanhoenacker, an American, worked as a management consultant before rekindling that childhood obsession. He learned to fly in Britain, tempted by our ‘historic relationship with aviation’. Coincidentally, his first job was to pilot the Airbus 320 on medium-distance European flights — exactly what Lubitz was doing on that catastrophically fateful day. But Vanhoenacker moved on to Boeing 747s, and they are his great love. He admires the 747 like a sculptor might a perfect human torso, observing how pleasing they are to the eye. Vanhoenacker recalls a wildlife writer once describing Virginia’s great blue heron as ‘the 747 of the swamp’ and notes how this would delight the aircraft’s chief designer, Joseph Sutter, who was greatly influenced by the anatomy of birds. But Sutter (now in his mid-90s) once stated that the 747 is more ‘a place’ than a conveyance. Pilots like flying 747s for all kinds of reasons, Vanhoenacker tells us, but not the least of them is one of the most prosaic: unlike the Airbus, in which pilots usually wear heavy socks, they have foot heaters. And the ‘frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean looks better — everything looks better — when your feet are warm’. He writes elegantly about his pilot’s eye view of the world and explains that he has come to measure countries in jet time, ie how long they take to cross. Thus, Russia is a seven-hour country and Belgium, with a tailwind, is merely a 15-minute country. Noting the vast, desolate regions he routinely flies over, it does not surprise him that, according to one calculation, the portion of the Earth’s surface on which an unclothed human could survive for 24 hours is just 15 per cent. But of even more interest, certainly to those of us who occasionally fly long-haul, are the nuts and bolts of those journeys. Vanhoenacker will get to the airport 90 minutes before he pilots his 747 to Los Angeles or Tokyo, and there will meet the rest of the crew, 20 or so strong. And ‘meet’ really means ‘meet’: air crews do not move as a pack, and are usually strangers to each other. As he puts it, ‘our nametags are not worn only for passengers... There is a reasonable chance we may never speak to each other again in our lives.’ Before boarding, he will brief the cabin crew on what kind of flight time and weather to expect, while they will tell him if there’s anything noteworthy about the passenger roster, and whether any of the BA staff on board have friends or family on the flight, people known, splendidly, as ‘Klingons’. Unsurprisingly, life on a 747 is full of jargon: a second co-pilot on longer flights is known as ‘the heavy’, one acting as ‘heavy out’, the other as ‘heavy home’. And for a pilot, the sky is full of aerial milestones called waypoints, with names usually comprising five capital letters. These often relate directly to the place below, so above Boston in Vanhoenacker’s home state, there is the waypoint LBSTA, referring to the region’s prized shellfish, and another, NIMOY, after one of the city’s more notable sons, the late actor Leonard Nimoy, who played Mr Spock in Star Trek. But other names are harder to explain. Above St Louis, Missouri, are the waypoints ANNII and LENXX. Vanhoenacker’s best guess is that an air-traffic controller there was a fan of Eurythmics’ singer Annie Lennox. Who would have thought that the mysteries of flying would embrace Mr Spock, Klingons and Annie Lennox? Skyfaring is crammed with these revelations and more, while the acknowledgments end on a plaintive note. Maybe one day, Vanhoenacker hopes, wide-eyed children will again be allowed in the cockpit during a flight. In the meantime, he does a very good job of telling us what happens in there, and why we should still trust the men at the controls."
"The car tried to crash through the barriers at Place de la Concorde, and police opened fire as it sped away.
One of the two is a 16-year-old male who said he was at the wheel.
A third person, a young woman in hospital with bullet wounds, is also thought to have been in the car.
She was operated on overnight at the hospital in a suburb to the west of the French capital.
Her life is not in danger, a police source told journalists.
A bullet-ridden car was later found abandoned near to the incident. Two men and two women were reported to have been seen leaving the vehicle.
British cyclist Chris Froome won his second Tour de France later on Sunday."
"Labour MP for Bassetlaw, John Mann, a Leave campaigner, said people voted to leave because of immigration, zero-hour contracts and job prospects and said a ""divide in Britain"" had been exposed.
Mansfield voted most strongly to leave, with 70.9% backing Brexit.
Rushcliffe, which includes the towns of West Bridgford and Bingham, was the only area to vote for Remain.
It saw the East Midland's highest turnout.
Meanwhile, the turnout in Nottingham was the fifth lowest in the UK at 61.8%.
Leave won by a tiny margin of just over 2,000 votes in the city.
Mr Mann said his party was ""somewhat out of touch"".
""With the middle classes largely voting remain because they see it as benefiting them and the working classes largely voting to leave because it dis-benefits them - that's the divide in Britain,"" he said.
Latest reaction and updates from Nottinghamshire
Like large parts of England, Nottinghamshire overwhelmingly voted to leave the European Union.
The margin of victory in Bassetlaw, Ashfield and Mansfield was huge, with less than a third of people voting remain.
Arguably the biggest surprise came in Nottingham, which narrowly backed Brexit.
Affluent Rushcliffe was the only area to vote Remain.
Overall Nottinghamshire voted 57.9% for Leave and 42.1% for Remain.
Conservative Anna Soubry, the MP for Broxtowe and a Remain campaigner, tweeted it was ""a dreadful decision"".
""People like me were told you're scaremongering, we don't want to listen to the experts,"" she said.
""All that has been unfortunately proved to be accurate. We have made a very, very, very bad mistake.""
Labour MP for Nottingham North, Graham Allen, said David Cameron had ""gambled with Britain's future"" by calling for a referendum, saying people voted to leave ""in protest"" at the current government.
Turnout was 81.5% in Rushcliffe - the highest in the East Midlands and the only council area to vote Remain.
The vote was close elsewhere, including in Nottingham, where the split was 50.8% Leave, 49.2% Remain.
Alice, a caller to BBC Radio Nottingham from the Carrington area of the city, said she felt ""frightened of the future"".
""It potentially gives a mandate for a lot of prejudice against people who have immigrated here, whether from the EU or elsewhere,"" she said."
"Jordon Ibe is on the verge of signing a new long-term contract as Brendan Rodgers prepares to re-launch the exciting teenager’s season. Liverpool offered Ibe fresh terms in February after he had a deep impression in a sequence of games, particularly against Everton and Tottenham, that coincided with an improvement in the club’s fortunes. A deal has now been agreed and it is simply a case of the highly-regarded Ibe, who has been absent since damaging knee ligaments against Besiktas on February 26, putting pen to paper. Jordon Ibe in training for Liverpool at Melwood as he prepares to make a return from injury . Ibe is set to sign a new long-term deal at Liverpool after breaking into the first team this season . Rodgers says Ibe, 19, has looked ‘absolutely sensational’ after stepping up his rehabilitation work in the last couple of weeks and he could come straight back into the starting line-up against Newcastle on Monday night. The issue Rodgers must address is whether to stick with the 4-3-3 formation he used at Blackburn in the FA Cup last Wednesday or revert to the 3-4-3 system that had been the catalyst for an improvement in results. One thing Liverpool’s manager has conceded, though, is that Daniel Sturridge is unlikely to recapture his very best form this season, given all the injuries he has suffered. Ibe, pictured in action against Tottenham, damaged his knee ligaments while playing against Besiktas . Sturridge, who has only scored four goals in his last 15 games, admitted last week that he felt it would have to wait until the new campaign to show last year’s sparkle and his manager agrees, following 12 months in which he has suffered thigh, calf and hip issues. ‘It’s a long time out,’ said Rodgers. ‘When you’re out for that length of time it maybe takes you the same amount of time to get back again. ‘The key for him was to get back and be fit but he needs a good pre-season under his belt, a total run at pre-season and hopefully he’ll be fine for next season. Until that point we have to maximise what we can get out of him.’ Brendan Rodgers prepares his Liverpool team for the visit of Newcastle to Anfield on Monday . Daniel Sturridge is yet to rediscover his best form since returning from a lengthy injury lay off . Rodgers added: ‘Every player is different. With Daniel there’s been a number of injuries that he’s had and that’s before he came here. He had a fairly sustained run last season and served us well but this season has been difficult. ‘He just needs to find a way to physically and mentally try to keep himself as fit as he can but sometimes that isn’t all down to you — sometimes it’s about luck as well.’"
"The victim was attacked because her son had eloped with an upper-caste girl about a month ago.
She has alleged that police initially refused to file a case saying such incidents were not uncommon.
The incident took place in Mulgaon village on Monday afternoon but reports of the atrocity have just come out.
The village in Satara district falls in the constituency of the state's Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan.
""The women pushed me to the ground, took off my sari and started beating me up with chappals [slipper] and a stick. They pulled my hair,"" the victim told a television channel.
She said the beatings continued for two hours.
On Wednesday, police arrested five people, including the eloped girl's parents.

"A Connecticut teenager with cancer who took her fight to stop her chemotherapy treatments to the state's Supreme Court must remain in custody of the state even though her disease has gone into remission, a judge ruled on Wednesday. Superior Court Judge Carl Taylor in Middletown, Connecticut, denied requests made last month by attorneys for both Cassandra and her mother, Jackie Fortin, that the 17-year-old be released from the temporary custody of the state Department of Children and Families, or that her mother be permitted to visit her in the hospital. The judge ruled on Wednesday she must remain in DCF custody until completing court-ordered chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, at Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford. Scroll down for video... Going nowhere: Cassandra Fortin was ordered by the Connecticut Supreme Court to undergo cancer treatment . Picture of health: Cassandra has been at Children's Medical Center in Hartford since December receiving chemo to which she was originally opposed . In state care: The Department of Children and Families took temporary custody after Cassandra refused her chemotherapy treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma . The state agency last fall won temporary custody of Cassandra after she and her mother argued she did not want chemo treatments despite the risk of dying without them. The state Supreme Court then ruled against Cassandra's claim that she was mature enough to make her own medical decisions. Treatments were ordered for at least six months after doctors said the teen had an 85 percent chance of survival with chemotherapy, but faced a near certainty of death within two years without it. But after she was declared by doctors to be in remission in March, her lawyer Joshua Michtom and attorneys for her mother appealed at a closed-door court hearing seeking permission to allow her to go home to complete treatments, or at least to permit her mother to visit her in the hospital. Staying put: Ms Fortin, left, said the hospital tried to prevent her mother, Jackie, right, from visiting her room . Support: Mrs Fortin, pictured, said she was behind her daughter's decision to not undergo cancer treatment. Hodgkins lymphoma (cells pictured) is a disease of the white blood cells . Hodgkin's Lymphoma is cancer of the white blood cells called B lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body. The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes or glands. These lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of HL is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. It usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50. The cause is unknown but risk factors include medical conditiona that weakens your immune system, taking immunosuppressant medication and being previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (which causes glandular fever). It isn't thought a family member having the disease increases the chances of developing it. The only way to confirm a diagnosis of HL is by carrying out a biopsy. Almost all young people with HL will be fully cured. For older people over the age of 50, the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent. Treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and drugs including steroids. 'She hasn't been able to see her mother for months, and now that she's in remission we don't think that's in her best interests,' said Attorney James Sexton, representing Fortin. DCF Commissioner Joette Katz said in a statement Wednesday her agency is 'looking forward to the day later this month when Cassandra can happily return home after her treatment is completed and the doctors are confident that she has beaten the cancer.' The case drew national attention when the teen rejected chemotherapy treatments after being diagnosed in September. Both the teen and her mother said she didn't want to poison her body, and she ran away after two chemo treatments. Michael Taylor, an attorney for the teen's mother, Jackie Fortin, said if the judge will not lift the temporary custody order, they would like for the teen at least to be able to visit with her mother at the hospital. Ms Fortinh said DCF has prohibited her from having contact with her mother. 'We'd like to end the whole thing,' Taylor said, according to The Hartford Courant, during a break in the hearing, 'but if we can't, we want to do as much as we can for her. She wants to be with her mother.' After Ms Fortin was diagnosed with high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma in September, she and her mother missed several appointments, prompting doctors to notify the DCF, court documents say. A trial court in November granted DCF temporary custody of Ms Fortin. Lawyers for Cassandra and her mother then sought an injunction prohibiting medical treatment but failed. The case went to the state Supreme Court, which ruled in January that the state wasn't violating Ms Fortin's rights by forcing her to undergo chemotherapy. The case centered on the mature minor doctrine recognised by several other states — whether 16- and 17-year-olds are mature enough to make their own medical decisions. Ms Fortin told People.com that she did not want to undergo chemotherapy and that when she was taken into care the state tried to prevent her mother from paying a visit. She said the hospital even posted a guard outside her door because they feared that she would try to escape. On the day before her chemotherapy, hospital staff were forced to restrain her before they could administer an anaesthetic. A judge has ruled against the 17-year-old girl who originally refused chemotherapy, and she will have to finish her treatments at the hospital instead of going home . She said: 'When a nurse came in and I told myself just to fight. When she started to put an IV in me, I wouldn't let her.' Ms Fortin spent two hours arguing with a doctor trying to convince them to suspend her treatment. 'Security had to pick me up, pin me to the bed and strap me down by my wrists and ankles, When I woke up, I looked down and there was a port in my chest. I thought, 'I cannot believe they did this to me.' 'I felt violated. I felt like I was being treated like an animal. I thought, 'How can you force a person, regardless of how old they are, to do something they haven't given consent to?''' In a statement Connecticut's DCF said:  'When experts -- such as the several physicians involved in this case -- tell us with certainty that a child will die as a result of leaving a decision up to a parent, then the Department has a responsibility to take action. Even if the decision might result in criticism, we have an obligation to protect the life of the child when there is consensus among the medical experts that action is required. 'Much of the improvements in Connecticut's child welfare system have come from working with families voluntarily to realise solutions to family challenges. 'Unfortunately that can't happen in every situation, especially when the life of a child is at stake.' Ms Fortin received three weeks' chemotherapy at Connecticut Children's Medical Center (pictured)"
"Manny Pacquiao has a better chance of beating Floyd Mayweather now than he did in 2010, claims his trainer Freddie Roach. The pair came close to agreeing a big-money bout five years ago but it eventually fell through, leaving the boxing world waiting and wondering whether they would ever meet. But after half a decade of speculation, the pair will finally go head-to-head in Las Vegas on May 2 - and Roach believes his man will have the advantage at the MGM Grand. Manny Pacquiao poses with his family and author Nik Vujicic in a photo posted to his Twitter account . Floyd Mayweather continues his training as he prepares to face Pacquiao after years of speculation . Pacquiao's trainer, Freddie Roach, believes his man is ready to beat Mayweather in Las Vegas on May 2 . Asked whether the 2010 or 2015 version of Pacquiao would have a better chance of victory against the unbeaten Mayweather, Roach told boxingscene.com: 'That is an interesting question because there are obviously trade-offs between the two versions of Manny. But I am convinced that the 2015 model is the more formidable fighter for a few reasons. 'Back in 2010, Manny was still growing into a welterweight. His first two welterweight fights were against Oscar De La Hoya in 2008 and Miguel Cotto in 2009 where he only weighed 142 and 144 pounds respectively, and in between he dropped down to 138 to fight Ricky Hatton. 'Floyd has been campaining as a welterweight since 2005 and weighed 150 in his fight against De La Hoya so that might have given Floyd an advantage. I still like Manny's chances in that fight but I think the Manny of today has a lot more in his favour. Pacquiao is better equipped to beat Mayweather now than he was in 2010, according to his trainer Roach . Mayweather is looking to extend his 47-fight unbeaten streak when he meets Pacquiao next month . The pair will go head-to-head in a $300million mega-fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2 . 'In 2010 the two-year age difference between the fighters was not significant to either, but that's not true today. Floyd at 38 is doing things he didn't do in the past. Floyd is a defensive genius but he has always depended on his legs to perform and you can see now that his legs do not have the same spring or fluidness of his earlier years. Mayweather remains the bookmakers' favourite for the $300million mega-fight next month but Roach is adamant that Pacquiao is primed to cause an upset. 'The 2015 version of Manny is more mature, smarter and less reckless than the 2010 version,' said Roach. 'He will be treating the ring like a chess board anticipating Floyd's moves - ready to cut him off and attack every time he creates an opening. 'I have all the confidence in the world that Manny is going to knock Floyd out on May 2.'"
"James McClean's reaction said it all. As Scott Carson's long, hopeful punt downfield floated harmlessly out of play, the talented winger spun in disgust, shook his head and threw open his arms. Wigan are better than this, and they know it. They were 2-1 down at that point, two moments of genius from Ross McCormack and Matt Smith the difference. They rallied to come away from Fulham with a point - it was a night in which new manager Gary Caldwell certainly saw enough to build on - but all at the club know their stay in the Championship is unlikely to be extended beyond May. It is an infuriating situation, the damage inflicted by an ultimately doomed appointment of Malky Mackay incurable this season.

The ever industrious Parker (left) dribbles away from the challenge of Wigan's Kim Bo-Kyung (right) Wigan winger Jermaine Pennant (left) scores a stunning free-kick to level the scores 1-1 against Fulham .

Booked: Burn, Kavanagh . Scorers: McCormack 4, Smith 35 . WIGAN (4-1-4-1): Carson, Boyce (McCann 70), Maguire, Pearce, Bong, Kvist, Perch, Pennant (Murphy 84), McClean, Kim Bo-kyung, Fortune (Waghorn 57) Subs not used: Mckay, Ojo, Barnett, Al Habsi . Scorers: Pennant 22, Pearce 69 . Referee: Mick Russell . Attendance: 15,994 . Caldwell must hope he has the character to build next year if they do fail to perform the improbable and remain in this division. Seven points is now the difference, Wigan having played at least a game more than their rivals with just four games to play. Their band of supporters in one corner of Craven Cottage recognise this is not the fault of Caldwell and are actually excited about what the future may hold. No Malky, no problem. But as McClean's annoyance indicates, they are all too aware that this impending relegation should not have been allowed to happen. The frustration is that their squad is more than capable of challenging under the right guidance, but probably won't have the opportunity to do so. Wigan showed guts and dug in for Caldwell, whose more patient style in possession was referenced by the Latics' official Twitter account midway through this. It felt like a sly dig to his predecessor. Matt Smith scores Fulham's second goal to restore their lead against Wigan at Carven Cottage on Friday . Smith slides to his knees as he celebrates putting the home side back in front in the Championship match . And to come from behind twice shows qualities they just did not possess under Mackay. Caldwell, a rugged central defender, will be unhappy with the ease with which McCormack opened the scoring after just four minutes; Harry Maguire's header was a poor one, straight into the path of Sean Kavanagh, who fed the Scot and he was afforded the time to pick a spot and curl beyond Scott Carson. In a game lacking genuine chances, there were then two moments of real class. Firstly Jermaine Pennant levelled for Wigan, bending a wicked 25-yard free-kick away from the despairing Marcus Bettinelli. He ran the full length of the pitch to celebrate in front of the travelling hundreds. Wigan utility player James Perch (left) jumps for the ball and is challenged by Fulham's Sean Kavanagh (right) But anything the winger could do, lanky Smith would match. Fulham's target man - again in too much space - looked up from the same distance and marvellously clipped over Carson to net just his third goal for the club since a summer move from Leeds. Those flashes from the front two rather masked what was a disjointed display by the Cottagers, still smarting from their derby humiliation against Brentford last week. Fans were furious at Kit Symons' lack of tactical imagination, further compounded when Jason Pearce gambled at the back post to equalise for the visitors in the 69th minute. Smith had been taken off six minutes previously to a chorus of boos and chants of 'you don't know what you're doing' rained down on Symons. The same when McCormack was hooked for defender Kostas Stafylidis. Much like against Brentford, Fulham's paying customers did not shirk away from telling him exactly what they thought. These are testing times for Symons, whose relationship with the fans is at its lowest ebb since he took over earlier this season. How he must've prayed Scott Parker didn't fluff his lines in stoppage time. Compare that to Wigan who, even though they will almost definitely join Blackpool in League One, are pulling in the same direction. Their new chairman David Sharpe, grandson of Dave Whelan, spoke of a long-term vision on appointing Caldwell on Tuesday, and that is something which has galvanised the place. Had Pennant's late header not been superbly blocked by Dan Burn, the talk might have been of an unlikeliest of survival miracles. Wigan's Jason Pearce (right) is congratulated by Pennant (left) as he scores the second equaliser for his side ."

World champion Hamilton started from the back, suffered a broken front wing on lap one and did five pit stops.
The Briton faces the prospect of trying to overhaul a 36-point deficit in the remaining 18 races of the season.
Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel came second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap.
The incident damaged both cars, with Raikkonen fighting back to fifth behind the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo.
Raikkonen's rise through the field included passing Hamilton in the closing stages, Ferrari's decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the mediums chosen by Mercedes giving the Finn an advantage as the Briton fought in vain to try to pass the Williams of Felipe Massa.
Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg's points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship.
The race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four.
By that stage, Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions.
Raikkonen moved right into Vettel's path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat.
Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber's Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen's damaged car swerving back on to the circuit.
Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: ""If I don't go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo.""
Kvyat replied: ""We didn't crash."" Vettel responded: ""You didn't. You were lucky this time."" Kvyat shrugged: ""I'm on the podium; you're on the podium.""
In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: ""You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium.""
Listen to Vettel's post-race rant
At the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner.
In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass.
Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front.
Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance.
Listen to the first-lap madness
Hamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race.
So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart.
He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr.
""The car was pretty damaged,"" said the 31-year-old afterwards. ""I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place.""
Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a ""lot of aerodynamic performance"".
After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year.

"Laura Matthews, 29, was told her signature - ""L. Skywalker"" - infringed a trademark in July this year.
She was issued with the document several weeks later, after threatening to take legal action.
But she has now been told the passport was issued in error and has been cancelled.
Ms Matthews told the BBC the decision has left her feeling ""upset, frustrated and disappointed"".
A Home Office spokesman said: ""Protecting the integrity of the UK passport is vital and we do not accept a change of name for frivolous reasons.""
In a letter to Ms Matthews, the Passport Office said its ""published guidance provides that we will refuse to recognise a change of name... if it is made for a bet or frivolous purpose.
""Additionally, in your case, the signature used in the passport is different to your surname and by your own admission was done for 'a laugh'"".
""Regrettably, an error was made in issuing your passport,"" the letter said.
""I am sorry that the error was made but I have to inform you that your passport will be cancelled.""
Ms Matthews, from Southend in Essex, added the middle name using a deed poll in 2008 ""for a bit of fun"".
She had not renewed her passport since adding the moniker, and experienced several weeks of delays when she tried to do so in April.
She was told the delays were because her signature ""infringed a trademark"".
Her passport was issued at the end of August after she contacted a law firm specialising in intellectual property law and said she would take legal action unless her application was approved.
Ms Matthews said this was the fourth time the Passport Office had changed its mind about her case.
""Now I'm not sure if it's my signature they have a problem with, or my middle name,"" she said.
""All I know it's extremely disappointing that I've been let down again by an organisation which doesn't seem to know if it's coming or going.
""I don't think I'm going to be able to fight it. I don't know what else I can do.""
The Home Office spokesman added: ""We have apologised to the applicant and agreed to meet the cost of a new passport in a name that meets the published guidance."""
"At long last, there's been a Scooby sighting in Iowa. Hillary Clinton's now-famous Mystery Mobile, an oversized, armored Chevy van, stopped in Iowa on Tuesday long enough for photographers to catch a glimpse of the vehicle that hauled the former secretary of state from New York to the American midwest. Unlike on Monday when Hillary stopped at an Ohio Chipotle for lunch, she popped into a coffee house in Le Claire, Iowa, for a cup of joe - and of tea. And at Tuesday's stop people actually recognized her. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . And she's off: Hillary Clinton gets ready to board the armored Chevy van which she is using to tour Iowa . MYSTERY MACHINE: Hillary Clinton's Secret Service-approved campaign van, nicknamed 'Scooby,' was photographed outside Jones Street Java House during a campaign visit on April 14 in Le Claire, Iowa . ORDINARY AMERICANS: Clinton sipped alongside Le Claire residents before heading to the town of Monticello for an education roundtable at Kirkwood Community College . Clinton talked with a panel of six at Kirkwood Community College on Tuesday in the school's auto-technology shop . ROAD TRIP: Clinton's black van started at her palatial Chappaqua, New York home and reached Monticello, Iowa as of Tuesday afternoon . Clinton focused her roundtable discussion on education issues, student loans and income inequality . Hillary and top aide Huma Abedin wore sunglasses inside the Chipotle on Monday in the Toledo suburb of Maumee and left without being engaged by anyone other than a cashier. Campaign operatives later phoned the New York Times, according to a journalist familiar with the chain of events, so reporters would know she had been there. A Times reporter later persuaded the restaurant's manager to send her photographs of his security-camera footage. Clinton ordered a chicken bowl with guacamole, a chicken salad and a fruit juice. The manager, Charles Wright, told Daily Mail Online that 'it's true nobody recognized her.' 'When the reporters started to call, I went back to the security footage, and there she was,' Wright said. 'The sunglasses probably made her harder to spot.' 'But it's not like there was anything special going on. She just stood in line like everyone else. I hope she stopped at Chipotle locations all the way from New York to wherever she's headed.' The 'Scooby' van, named as an homage to the Scooby-Doo cartoon and its 'Mystery Machine' vehicle, is an upgraded Chevrolet 1500.

'ALL HAIL THE QUEEN': Joey Gallagher of Iowa City, Iowa shouted as he staged a protest outside Kirkwood Community College on April 14, 2015 . Iowa City resident Matthew Evans scratched out his 'Stand w/ Rand' sign in favor of an anti-Hillary slogan as Mrs. Clinton was set to arrive for her first official presidential campaign event . THIS MANY PEOPLE KNEW ME! No one in an Ohio Chipotle restaurant recognized Clinton on Monday when she and aide Huma Abedin stopped for lunch . At Kirkwood Community College in Monticello, Iowa, supporters turned out in force to see Hillary, with one activist telling Mail Online 'we're here to see the queen' You go girl: Two senior voters turned out to show their support for Hillary with this homemade sign . In Monticello, Kirkwood Community College became a carnival bazaar as reporters staked out the building awaiting Mrs. Clinton. Two protesters, possibly the first of her nascent campaign, held signs complaining that she was a friend of Wall Street and cast a U.S. Senate vote to support the Iraq war. 'All hail the queen!' shouted Iowa City resident Joey Gallagher, one of the pair. As journalists passed by, he carefully scribbled on the back of his sign to cover up a 'Stand With Rand' campaign slogan.

Before visiting Le Claire, Hillary help a roundtable discussion with students at Kirkwood Community College . Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican senator, launched his own presidential campaign earlier this month in Louisville. But Matthew Evans, the second protester, insisted that 'we're not here with anybody.' 'We're here to see the queen.' As Clinton's van pulled into the Kirkwood parking lot - trailed at a short distance by a black Humvee - Evans waved a sign and repeatedly shouted, 'Give the Saudi money back!' Clinton nicknamed her campaign van 'Scooby' in honor of the popular television show Scooby Doo, in which a gang of teenagers drive around a van and solve mysteries . Hillary Clinton's custom van is Chevrolet Express Explorer Limited SE, 'a kind of full-size living room on wheels,' according to Yahoo News. It sports a 6-liter V-8 engine and a six-speed automatic transmission, more than enough horsepower for a Secret Service driver to outrun most any ne-er-do-well. Yahoo reports that the vehicle was produced with all union labor and made in the USA, as any UAW-friendly Democrat would have to ensure. Among other enhancements, Clinton's private ride is armor plated. Armor is usually placed underneath the original exterior of the vehicle. She said in a 2014 speech that it had been nearly two decades since she had driven a car, however, making it likely that she's being chauffeured around the midwest this week. That's a reference to the millions of dollars the Saudi Arabian government donated to the Clinton Foundation while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. Republicans cite it as one of many examples of the Clinton family philanthropy pocketing money from countries seeking special dispensation from the State Department during her tenure. The foundation now bears her name, along with those of former president Bill Clinton and their daughter Chelsea. As morning turned to afternoon in Monticello, smoke billowed on the horizon and reporters asked the locals what was burning. The likely culprit, a controlled leaf-burning. But Joe Murphy, who said he was part of the audio crew for Clinton's visit, told Daily Mail Online that 'Hillary might have crashed her Mystery Machine.' 'I should shut up,' he added. On Monday Daily Mail Online spoke with Kirkwood students anticipating Clinton's arrival. One, Corey Jones, said he was chosen to ask her a question, and would focus on illegal immigration. 'You know, Obama's plan was to make the illegal immigrants legal,' said Jones. 'She's part of all that. And some people think – well, I think maybe – it's just a tactic to have more Democratic votes' from millions of grateful new citizens. While inside the school, according to administrators, Clinton will tour the Advance Manufacturing Lab and see the Auto Technology Lab. Then she is scheduled to sit with a hand-picked group of students and faculty to take questions in a roundtable format. At Casey's General Store in Monticello, cashier Kathy Rigby said she was open to hearing what Hillary has to say . 'I think the whole government sucks. They need to stop running my life. It's everything, including my health care. Especially my health care.' 'But if Hillary comes, I'd go listen to her. I wouldn't vote for anyone I haven't heard from.' INCOGNITO: Hillary Clinton (center) and Huma Abedin (behind her) were spotted – only by a security camera – lunching on Monday at Chipotle in Maumee, Ohio . LISTENING: Clinton's coffee shop visit is part of an effort to make her appear more personable as she chats with ordinary Iowans in living rooms and at small businesses .

"La Liga strugglers Almeria have named former Barcelona player Sergi Barjuan as their third coach of the season.

Almeria confirmed that if all the necessary paperwork is complete Barjuan will coach Almeria's away match at Barcelona on Wednesday.

Barjuan spent nine years at Barcelona as a defender and played in two World Cups for Spain. He coached Recreativo in Spain's second division from 2012-14. Almeria are in the relegation zone after failing to win in seven straight matches. The club fired their first manager of the season, Francisco Rodriguez, in December."
"Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called it a ""jihadist attack"". It is believed an Islamist cell of at least eight militants was involved.
In June 2015, Spain raised its terror alert level to four - one short of the maximum, level five. And since June 2016, Spanish security sources say, police have detained 164 suspected jihadists.
The use of a van zig-zagging at high speed through a pedestrian zone recalls the jihadist attacks in London, Berlin and Nice.
In December, Spain's interior ministry recommended installing barriers to stop any vehicle being driven into Las Ramblas, but the city did not do so, the ABC daily reports.
The Barcelona attack was claimed by so-called Islamic State (IS), though nothing confirms a direct IS link to it yet.
Five suspected jihadists were shot dead by police on Thursday night in Cambrils, a town 120km (75 miles) south of Barcelona.
Suspects killed in second Spain attack
Spain attacks - latest updates
Spain attacks: What we know so far
In pictures: Barcelona van attack
In recent years Spain has intensified its security co-operation with nearby Morocco. There is believed to be a Moroccan connection in the Barcelona case.
The van driver is still on the run, but police have arrested four suspects - three Moroccans and a Spaniard from the North African enclave of Melilla.
One of the Moroccans was named as 28-year-old Driss Oukabir. The hunt is on for his brother Moussa, thought to have rented the van using Driss's name.
Barcelona has just seen Spain's worst attack since the Madrid train bombings of March 2004, in which 191 people died and more than 1,800 were injured.
Islamist militants detonated 10 bombs on four commuter trains in the capital, in what remains Europe's bloodiest terror attack this century.
Spain has long been a potential target because hundreds of its soldiers are in the international coalition against IS. They are training Iraqi security forces but do not have a combat role.
In recent years Spain has seen a home-grown problem of Islamist radicalisation, said political violence expert Javier Argomaniz of St Andrews University.
Since 2013 about half of the suspects arrested have been Spanish-born, mostly very young, from poor, marginalised immigrant families, he told the BBC.
""There is radicalisation both online and through peer groups, but the online element is very strong,"" he said.
The violent Basque independence campaign waged by Eta for decades led Spain to pour resources into anti-terrorism units. The lack of major terror attacks in Spain since 2004 may be evidence of their professionalism.
What is Eta?
The last terror attack in Barcelona was the murder of a policeman by Eta militants in 2000.
Facing up to the Eta threat saw Spanish anti-terror expertise shared with the French police, who played a key role in sapping the group's capability.
Eta is now disarming. The last Eta attack on Spanish soil was in Majorca in 2009, when a car bomb killed two Civil Guard officers.
Islamist radicalisation has been concentrated in four areas of Spain in recent years, the Spanish daily El Pais reports. Barcelona - with a large Muslim community - is the main area where it has happened.
The others are: Melilla, Ceuta (Spain's other North African enclave), and Madrid and its suburbs.
As part of its anti-terror measures, Spain brought in new laws against funding of terrorism, self-radicalisation through social media and travel abroad to train or fight with a jihadist group. All those crimes carry prison sentences.
Most of the 178 Spanish citizens who have gone to fight for IS or other jihadist groups have been from Ceuta or Melilla. About 10 times more jihadists have gone to the Middle East from France, it is believed."
"""CETA is done and we will not reopen it,"" said EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom.
Ms Malmstrom was speaking as EU trade ministers met in Slovakia to discuss CETA and a similar deal with the US, TTIP, which has also faced criticism.
A draft CETA deal has been agreed, but parliaments could still delay it.
Thousands of activists protested against CETA and TTIP in Germany on Saturday and thousands more in Brussels - outside the EU's headquarters - on Tuesday.
Activists fear that the deals could water down European standards in the key areas of workers' rights, public health and the environment.
There is also great anxiety about proposed special courts where investors will be able to sue governments if they feel that legislation hurts their business unfairly.
Critics say the mere existence of such courts - an alternative to national courts - will have a ""chilling"" effect on policymakers, leading to slacker regulation on the environment and welfare.
Would CETA be a good model for the UK?
European Parliament briefing on CETA
TTIP: The EU-US trade deal explained
Are US-Europe TTIP trade talks tanking?
Ms Malmstrom said CETA would dominate Friday's meeting in Bratislava. The Commission hopes the deal can be signed with Canada at the end of October, so that it can then go to the European Parliament for ratification. But it will also need to be ratified by national parliaments across the EU.
""What we are discussing with the Canadians is if we should make some clarifications, a declaration so that we can cover some of those concerns,"" Ms Malmstrom said.
She acknowledged fears in some countries that politicians might see their ""the right to regulate"" diluted. ""Maybe that [right] needs to be even clearer in a declaration,"" she said, admitting that the CETA negotiations were still ""difficult"".
Karoline Graswander-Hainz, an Austrian Socialist MEP, said the EU's top court - the European Court of Justice - must first examine the proposed Investment Court System (ICS) to check its legality.
CETA holds ""great risks"" for Europe, she warned, adding that some of her fellow MEPs thought likewise.
German Vice-Chancellor and Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel called CETA ""a model for future deals"".
But he was pessimistic about TTIP. ""The Americans were not prepared to make Europe offers that Canada made, and so there will definitely not be a [TTIP] deal this year,"" he said.
Supporters of CETA and TTIP say such deals could set global trade standards, warning that failure could mean China setting the standards.
CETA and TTIP promise to remove tariffs and non-tariff barriers, boosting growth on both sides of the Atlantic, free trade advocates say."

Her apology read: 'I would like to apologise to all MCFC fans for the error of judgement I made last night. 'I now appreciate the significance of my actions and can assure everyone connected with Manchester City that I am proud to represent the Club and wear the shirt.'

The Class of '92 have eaten there, and Wayne Rooney is a regular. The England and United captain celebrated his last two birthdays there, and held a Q&A session at the restaurant. Rooney was helping Wing's gain publicity after starring in an educational video in the build-up to the Chinese New Year on February 19.

"Three girls, aged 10, eight and five, and two five-year-old boys were taken to hospital following the collision on Wentedge Road, near Kirk Smeaton.
The crash, involving a red Mercedes A180 and a blue Vauxhall Corsa, happened at about 18:20 on Thursday.
North Yorkshire Police said a number of the casualties had suffered serious but not life threatening injuries.
Women aged 36, 19 and 18 were also taken to hospital.
The force has appealed for witnesses to the collision to come forward.
The road was closed for about four hours to allow investigators to examine the scene."
"Girl power was the definite winner at yesterday’s historic Boat Race as women rowed on the same course and same day as the men for the first time. Oxford University women’s rowing team beat Cambridge – inspiring their male colleagues to win for the third time running in the 161st race. The women’s race has been held since 1927 further up river at Henley, but after years of campaigning for equal billing, they were finally given equality with the men. Scroll down for video . Water babes: Oxford's women's team made history and competed alongside the men for the first time . Joy: Oxford, who entered the race as favourites, took an early lead and finished more than six lengths ahead . Oxford, who entered the race as favourites, took the lead within the first few minutes and never looked like losing it. They finished six-and-a-half lengths and 19 seconds ahead. The team’s performance was undoubtedly boosted by American Olympic Gold medallist and world champion Caryn Davies, who was the most experienced rower – male or female – on the river. She said winning had been tougher than the Olympics. ‘It hurts a lot,’ she added. Cox Jennifer Ehr had told her colleagues before the start of the race: ‘Let’s do this for everyone who made it happen. Let’s make history today.’ There were scenes of tears and jubilation when the victorious women were helped out of their boat. Team captain Anastasia Chitty said it had been ‘humbling’ to win on the same course as the men. ‘It’s just amazing. It’s a really special moment,’ she said. Oxford’s preparations had been far from smooth. Ten days ago, the crew had to be rescued by the RNLI when their boat sank during a training session. Huge crowds watched yesterday’s event, which will transform perceptions of the women’s race, meaning that its days as the poor relation are well and truly over. Winners: Anastasia Chitty, president of the Oxford University Women's Boat Club, celebrates today's win ."

"It has been almost 20 years since a 21-year-old Tiger Woods stormed the course at Augusta en route to his first victory at the Masters in 1997, and now there is a new American star on the block in the form of 2015 Masters champion Jordan Spieth. Spieth shattered record after record on the way to his triumph at Augusta on Sunday. The 21-year-old held a a four-shot lead heading into the final day of action and never looked back as he became the first man ever to reach 19 under par in the Masters. Having finished joint-second, along with Jonas Blixt, to Bubba Watson at last year's tournament, Spieth stormed to a final round of 70 to cap off an incredible few days on the Georgia course.

Spieth kisses his girlfriend Annie Verret following his record-breaking title win on Sunday . Born in Dallas, Texas - Spieth grew up the oldest of three siblings to Shawn and Chris Spieth. Spieth began gaining attention in the golf world when he was just a teenager, becoming the only American besides Woods to claim two US Junior Amateur titles after winning in 2009 and 2011. As a result of his accomplishments in junior play, he even gained entry into a PGA event, becoming the sixth youngest player to ever make the cut when at just 17 years of age he began the third round in the PGA Tour's HP Byron Nelson Championship, ultimately finishing in an impressive tie for 16th place. Soon after he decided to attend the University of Texas, leading them to the NCAA Championship in his first year and getting to play in the US Open in 2012, where he finished as a low amateur.

He left however during his second year, and by the end of the 2013 season found himself 10th on the PGA Tour money list, winning the PGA Tour Rookie of the Year, an honor also won by Woods. This after he became the fourth youngest winner in PGA history after taking the John Deere Classic when he was just 19-years-old and was selected by golfing great Fred Couples to play in the 2013 Presidents Cup. His Masters debut and subsequent second-placed finish to Watson followed in 2014. Spieth will no longer have to dwell on that disappointment, however, after his Augusta heroics on Sunday. Things are going just as well off the course for the young golf star. Spieth, who is going out with high school sweetheart Annie Verret, recently bought a stunning mansion in his hometown at a cost of $2.3million."

Walking the journey from Turf Moor to Selhurst would usually take 69 hours, according to Google Maps' estimations, but Boyd has managed it in less than 40 hours of playing time.

"Ed Miliband made his first appearance on the campaign trail in three days this morning after going to ground over the Easter weekend. The Labour leader was out campaigning in Bristol this morning – his first public appearance since Saturday. While Mr Miliband decided to take the weekend off to spend time with his family – his political rivals wasted no opportunity to drum up support with just a month to go before polling day. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband made his first appearance on the campaign trail in over 72 hours this morning after going to ground over the Easter weekend . While Mr Miliband decided to take the weekend off to spend time with his family – his political rivals wasted no opportunity to drum up support with just a month to go before polling day . After a low-key day campaigning in his constituency in Doncaster on Saturday, the Labour leader spent all of Sunday and Monday with his family . Labour election chiefs have reportedly calculated that it is better to keep a low profile outside of the live TV debates, where he can speak directly to voters. There have already been rumblings of discontent in the party over the amount of time Mr Miliband appears to be spending preparing for the debates. After a low-key day campaigning in his constituency in Doncaster on Saturday, the Labour leader spent all of Sunday and Monday with his family. At the same time, David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Nigel Farage and Nicola Sturgeon was prominent on the campaign trail. The Prime Minister was pictured kissing an orphaned lamb on Easter Sunday, and he delivered a major speech on the economy on Bank Holiday Monday yesterday. Mr Clegg spent Easter Sunday with his family, but he made a series of campaign visits yesterday. David Cameron - greeted in Belfast by Tory minister Theresa Villiers - is on a whirlwind tour of the UK his wife Samantha  - visiting Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England . Mr Cameron, holding his wife's hand, visited the Titanic Studios in Belfast, where they saw the film sets for the TV drama Game of Thrones . The Prime Minister visited Edinburgh this morning - where he tucked into breakfast with Samantha . Both Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg recorded televised Easter messages, while the Labour Leader only posted a statement to Facebook. The Prime Minister has also ramped up his campaigning today – visiting constituencies in all four countries of the United Kingdom while Mr Miliband is appearing at an event in Bristol. A number of Labour MPs are concerned at Mr Miliband’s decision to appear in a third TV debate a week on Thursday. The showdown – dubbed the ‘Challengers Debate’ – will not feature the Prime Minister or his Mr Clegg, leaving the Labour leader open to attacks from the SNP, Plaid and the Greens. One MP said it was ‘madness’ for him to take part in the debate minor parties without the Tories and Lib Dems. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg works while traveling on a train to the north west of England while on the  campaign trail . Nigel Farage - who was campaigning in Kent yesterday - met workers at Bird and Yates car repairs during campaigning in Cannock in the Midlands today . First Minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP Nicola Sturgeon met with residents of Livingston, west Lothian . A Labour source told the Telegraph: ‘We understand that there are different views but we took a simple decision: the more people see a man with the energy, principles and the ideas to change Britain the better it is. ‘And the more opportunity we can have to speak directly with the public the better it is. ‘You can gameplay 100 different scenarios but if someone offers us 90 minutes of airtime to talk to the public, if he has a chance to talk to millions of people, we should take it.’ Mr Miliband this morning used his first campaign appearance since Saturday to launch a fresh attack on the Tory record on the NHS. The Labour leader said A&E waiting times had soared because the Government had failed to keep GP surgeries open at evenings and weekends. Addressing an audience in Bristol, he said: ‘The NHS cannot go forward if queues to see your GP are stretching backwards and I believe that Britain can do a lot better than people waiting day after day for basic healthcare. That's what our plan will do.’ While Ed Miliband went to ground yesterday, the Prime Minister hit the campaign trail - visiting supporters in Poole, Dorset . Ukip leader Nigel Farage was also out campaigning yesterday, on Bank Holiday Monday, visiting families in South Thanet, Kent . Mr Cameron meanwhile was on a whirlwind tour visiting all four nations of the UK in a day. He kicked off his aeroplane tour in Edinburgh, visiting the Scottish Widows headquarters for breakfast with wife Samantha. The Prime Minister chatted to staff about pension changes as he tucked into haggis, egg and fried bread, while Mrs Cameron had a bacon roll. He was later due to fly to Wales before addressing a rally of supporters in the south-west of England. Ahead of the 600-mile trip, Mr Cameron insisted he had a ‘simple message’. He said: ‘We have one month to save our economy from the disaster of an Ed Miliband government. ‘We have one month to save Britain from his mountain of debt; one month to save Britain from his punitive taxes; one month to save Britain, and British families, from his anti-business and anti-aspiration agenda.’ The premier said Britain had been put back on its feet over the past five years, adding all four parts of the UK were now growing."
"Haile Gebrselassie - Olympic gold medallist, winner of more than 20 sporting records, businessman and activist - pulled out of his first appearance at the New York marathon with a knee injury and told journalists afterwards that he was quitting competitive sports.
Ethiopian state television carried the announcement on Monday morning.
""We love Haile very much, every Ethiopian loves him,"" Eyoseyas Daniel, 23, told the BBC on the streets of the capital Addis Ababa.
He said he was sorry to hear of Haile's retirement and that he hoped he would reconsider.
""He is our hero and I don't think there is any runner who runs like him and I don't think any runner who will come like him. He is just a hero.""
Abebe Abebaw said he was a model for the country, while another Addis Ababa resident Walelgn Tamir recalled how he had been at the forefront of Ethiopia's long-distance running rivalry with neighbouring Kenya.
But he recognised that Gebrselassie's career could not go on for ever.
""He is getting old, older and older, so it is getting difficult after this time for him because of age,"" he said.
Haile Gebrselassie, 37, leaves the sport he dominated for the last two decades with a string of records.
But he has also made a name for himself outside the sporting world, as a businessman, educator, philanthropist and art collector.
He and his wife, Alem, have three daughters and one son. He told a local magazine last year that he would like his children to become runners, to achieve more than he has and to make their own names.
The couple also own a construction business and built the country's first private cinema, which shows only Ethiopian films. Alem Cinema is in the same building that houses the gym where he trains, Alem Fitness Centre.
He has built and owns two schools, and his resort in the southern tourist town of Hawassa opened earlier this year.
Gebrselassie's influence even stretches into politics. He is one of the Elders, a group of Ethiopians who have mediated in political crises in the country since 2005.
The Elders helped negotiate the release of the people imprisoned in the aftermath of the bitterly-disputed 2005 parliamentary election.
They also helped broker the pardon and release last month of the opposition leader, Birtukan Mideksa. Gebrselassie apparently allowed Ms Birtukan to recuperate at his resort, free of charge, with her mother and young daughter.
He is aware that his achievements in sports have made him an international legend, and told me last year that he would use that platform to make a difference in the world.
And so, beyond national politics, Gebrselassie is involved in international campaigns against climate change and malaria.
He feels strongly that athletes must be taught to manage their finances, and spent one week last November training with and mentoring young runners.
Ten years ago, he founded the Great Ethiopian Run, which has since become known as Africa's biggest road race.
The contest is open to amateur and professional runners and is recognised as a show of talent from the continent's next generation of runners.
So beloved is Gebrselassie in Ethiopia that in 2001, the country's best known musician Tedi Afro composed a song in his honour and with his name.
Given his status both nationally and beyond, there are some who believe that Gebrselassie may not have finished running - but that his next race may well be a political one."
"Rangers were knocked out of the Europa League qualifiers while Alves was on international duty with Portugal.
The 35 year old has now started training with the club and has set his sights on winning trophies at Ibrox.
""Even if we didn't play European games of course I would have joined this club,"" Alves said.
""It was [frustrating] because I have expectations to play European games but it was not this year.
""Maybe it is going to be next year. We need to be focused now.""
Alves signed a two-year deal at Rangers after leaving Serie A side Cagliari, but was late joining up with the squad in pre-season because he was playing in the Confederations Cup in Russia with Portugal, who finished third.
Rangers defeated Progres Niederkorn 1-0 in the first-leg at Ibrox, but lost in Luxembourg 2-0 as manager Pedro Caixinha tries to blend in his summer signings - with nine players having joined the club this summer.
Alves is the most experienced, and the former Porto, Zenit St Petersburg and Fenerbahce defender is focused on helping the Ibrox club to a successful season.
""I already know how big is this club and for me I am proud to come here and join this team,"" he said.
""Everybody has good expectations for the season and we are working very hard to achieve what we propose to do.
""I can bring my experience and what I have learned in football.
""I have won with almost all of the clubs I have played with and I hope to bring that again to this big club.
""I am looking forward to putting the jersey on and playing and giving my best and also learn because football is continuous learning. It is going to be a good experience for myself."""
"Shaun Ritchie, 20, was last seen with friends at a remote woodland area near Strichen on the night of Friday 31 October into the Saturday morning.
Police Scotland said it had been one of the biggest ever search operations carried out by the force.
There was no evidence, said the police, that he had been the victim of a crime.
Insp Stewart Drummond said: ""The searches carried out to locate Shaun have been extensive and also challenging due to the difficult terrain.
""Items of Shaun's clothing were recovered as part of the early stages of the enquiry which would have placed him in the Greenburn area.
""If Shaun has walked on from this area, as appears to be the case, we have no indication of the direction he has taken, which compounds further searches due to the size of terrain already searched.""
He explained:  ""We have interviewed a number of people, including those who were with Shaun on the night he was last seen.
""Although we will always keep an open mind as to the circumstances, there is no evidence to date which would indicate that Shaun has been a victim of any crime.
""We understand this is a difficult time for Shaun's family who just want answers and not knowing where he is or what has happened to him is beyond frustration for them.
""We are therefore again appealing for any information which may assist us in finding Shaun and ask people to come forward and contact Police Scotland.""
A CCTV image released earlier showed Mr Ritchie wearing dark grey skinny jeans, a white t-shirt, a grey hoodie and brown trainers."
"A young woman says she lives on almost nothing but Rice Krispies – and insists she is still healthier than most people. Natalie Swindells, 26, eats four bowls of the cereal every day. She can’t face eating much else and has not tasted a vegetable for nearly two decades. The bank worker, who says she has never taken a day off sick, stopped eating most other foods from the age of two. She now believes overeating causes more health problems than having a very restricted diet like her own. In a typical day, Miss Swindells will have two bowls of Rice Krispies with milk for breakfast, followed by a slice of bread and butter for lunch, and two bowls of Rice Krispies again for dinner . ‘I think doctors overestimate the amount of vitamins that we need to be healthy,’ she said. ‘I think it is about how much you eat, not what you’re eating.’ In a typical day, Miss Swindells will have two bowls of Rice Krispies with milk for breakfast, followed by a slice of bread and butter for lunch, and two bowls of Rice Krispies again for dinner. Consultant dietician Sian Porter said: ‘It might not sound like it but Natalie is actually getting a pretty balanced diet . She will also occasionally eat milk chocolate, ready salted crisps and chips. Although she consumes fewer than half of the recommended 2,000 calories for women Miss Swindells still has an active lifestyle. She lives in Macclesfield with her boyfriend Daniel Walsh, 26, who she says has grown accustomed to her strange eating habits. ‘He’s pretty cool with it,’ she said. ‘When we first got together he tried to make me eat different things but it didn’t last very long. It was just pointless. Everything he made me try I didn’t like.’ In fact, the last time she tasted a vegetable was 18 years ago, when her mother tried to make her eat a roast dinner – and failed. Consultant dietician Sian Porter said: ‘It might not sound like it but Natalie is actually getting a pretty balanced diet. She’s getting protein and calcium from the milk and of course Rice Krispies are fortified with lots of vitamins and iron so this could explain why she’s stayed so healthy.’ But nutritionist Dr Carina Norris warned: ‘Her diet is lacking massively in minerals and vitamins. It is miles from any dietary recommendation.’ ÷ Each Kellogg’s Rice Krispie is made from a single grain of rice that is toasted. ÷ The breakfast cereal has added sugar, salt and barley malt flavouring, as well as added vitamins and minerals. ÷ A small, 30g serving of Rice Krispies contains 115 calories of energy (6 per cent of the recommended daily allowance), 0.3g of fat (less than one per cent of the RDI), 26g carbohydrates (3g of which is sugars) 0.3g fibre and 1.8g protein. ÷ Rice Krispies arrived in British shops in November 1928. ÷ The brand’s famous Snap, Crackle and Pop elf characters first appeared on cereal boxes in 1941. ÷ Jonathan Ross made his television debut in an advert for the cereal aged ten in 1970. ÷ In 1963, the Rolling Stones recorded a song for a TV ad for the cereal."
"Can Rickie Lambert sue for restraint of trade? Brendan Rodgers has killed off Lambert's career and you've got to feel sorry for the player. You can't blame him for joining Liverpool – why would he turn that down? At the time he was a confident striker – playing regularly in the Premier League and scoring goals for Southampton. He'd just been to a World Cup. Rickie Lambert has scarcely been given a chance since joining Liverpool despite their striking problems . Brendan Rodgers' decision to ignore Lambert, in favour of Mario Balotelli, is completely illogical . This time last year Lambert was about to play at a World Cup for England but his stock has fallen since . For Rodgers to ignore him when they have desperately needed goals is illogical. I'm well aware Lambert isn't Luis Suarez, I know he's not a world-class striker. Lambert missed out on Saturday at West Brom because of a hip injury but it must have been gutting for him to see Mario Balotelli get yet another chance. The England striker played 90 minutes 20 times last season, made 31 starts, and unlike any Liverpool player in the scoring charts this season, easily got into double figures. Contrast that with this campaign when in terms of Premier League minutes on the pitch Lambert has played the equivalent of roughly six-and-a-half games. Lambert has enjoyed the opportunity to score for his boyhood team but he deserves more football . When he has started in the Premier League or Champions League, Lambert and Liverpool have impressed . On his first Premier League start for Liverpool he scored, and when he played 90 minutes in four consecutive games he scored in the first game, Liverpool won the next two, and drew the fourth. And then he was dropped again and hasn't started since. Meanwhile, Balotelli regularly gets more time on the pitch, and regularly fails to deliver. He has to go down as Liverpool's worst-ever signing – at least the club won a trophy when Andy Carroll was at Anfield. How come Balotelli got more time on the pitch at Wembley last weekend than Lambert? And what about Saturday? Balotelli was hopeless yet again. Whether you watch his performance or check the stats, he was useless – not for the first time this season. Ultimately it'd be wrong to suggest Lambert was going to be the man to spearhead Liverpool's charge to the title and a Champions League challenge. But to be so underused in a season when Daniel Sturridge has been missing for so long, and Balotelli has been ineffective, is inexplicable. Balotelli, no matter which way you look at it, has been useless, and Lambert should be picked ahead of him . Balotelli was given more time on the pitch than Lambert in Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final defeat by Villa . Lambert scored 20 goals for Southampton - he may not be world class, but he is better than the alternatives . Lambert should have joined Aston Villa in January. But he found out about the move just a few hours before the transfer window closed and chose to stay. Rodgers told Lambert that he didn't want him to go. Why say that and then not bother using him? Nobody can ever take away the fact that Lambert has scored for his boyhood club Liverpool in the Premier League and the Champions League. And Lambert is the kind of guy who will treasure those special moments and keep them close to his heart. But he's lost his England place and his reputation as a Premier League striker has been seriously undermined by Rodgers and Liverpool this season."
"The allegations relate to Mr Olmert's time as Jerusalem mayor in the 1990s.
Mr Olmert, who resigned as prime minister in 2009, has already been charged in three unrelated corruption cases. He denies any wrongdoing.
The latest charges concern the construction of a luxury residential complex in Jerusalem called Holyland which is built on a prominent hilltop.
Prosecutors claim that millions of dollars changed hands illegally to facilitate a series of property deals.
Jerusalem's planning laws were altered to enable the complex to be built. The project's developers have also been charged in the case.
Haaretz newspaper describes the case as one of the largest corruption scandals in Israel's history.
The former prime minister denies any wrongdoing and has called the investigation a ""witch hunt"".
Mr Olmert was mayor of Jerusalem from 1993 - 2003, then became a minister in the Israeli cabinet. He took over as prime minister in 2006 after Ariel Sharon suffered a stroke.
His three-year premiership was dogged by corruption allegations, and he eventually agreed to stand down.
Mr Olmert has pleaded not guilty in the separate proceedings against him, in which he is accused of taking cash for favours and double-billing for overseas trips."
"Victoria's Secret caused huge a backlash when it unveiled campaign slogan 'The Perfect Body' splashed across an image of skinny models. More than 27,000 people signed a Change.com petition started by three students asking for an apology, and for the initiative to be scrapped. And a few days later, the US lingerie firm changed the wording of the advertisement - but that hasn't stopped similar brands poking fun at the ridiculous message of the original slogan. Scroll down for video . The final ten contenders for Star In ABra feature in the powerful new image recreating the notorious VS advert . A new campaign from Curvy Kate - a lingerie brand for women with bigger boobs - recreates that notorious image using models of all shapes and sizes. The D+ label says its image is 'empowering', especially with the widespread call for real models alongside campaigns like #droptheplus - sparked by a model who was labelled 'plus' because she was bigger than sample size - an Australian size 4. It coincides with the shortlist of their annual global Star in A Bra contest, where a 'real woman' wins the job of being its lingerie model. Hopefuls enter online and the winner becomes the face and body of Curvy Kate, and gets a year-long modelling contract with Bridge Models Limited, a trip to the Mediterranean and £1,000 spending money. Victoria's Secret caused huge consumer backlash when it unveiled its campaign last year . The final ten contenders feature in the powerful new image. Brunette Emma Webley, who is pictured centre-left in the group shot, says: 'Making the top 10 (and hopefully winning) is a brilliant opportunity for me to spread my belief that everyone should be confident about their body, no matter what shape or size they are. 'To feel body confident you just need to be happy with who you are and surround yourself with positive people. Confidence, a warm personality and a smile is the most beautiful thing a girl can have.' The next stage in the competition is to get support with public votes, which can be done through the Star in a Bra website. Curvy Kate has said: 'With the public outcry for the use of more realistic images in the media, Star in a Bra champions the use of relatable role models and promotes a positive approach to body image. 'We want to show you exactly how our lingerie will look and fit on a variety of body shapes, cementing that there isn't one type of perfect body.'"

"Commentators on the internet have been quick to make fun of Mr Boehner over the years, but his willingness to show emotion has also endeared him to many.
His latest crying bout came on Thursday as he watched Pope Francis address Congress and a crowd of thousands just outside of his office.
With his face scrunched, his wet green-blue eyes glistening and matching his tie, he did not disappoint.
Boehner, dubbed the ""Weeper of the House,"" responded to jokes about his emotions with this tweet.
Other notable times he cried include when he became House Speaker, during Congressional Gold Medal ceremonies, at the unveiling of statues and even during an interview with the Golf Channel.
Here is how Twitter reacted to its favourite wailer unexpectedly announcing he will resign from Congress at the end of October:"
"Woods, 41, is recovering from a fourth back operation since April 2014.
The American 14-time major winner was breathalysed in Florida in May after being arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence.
He denied alcohol was involved and said it was down to ""an unexpected reaction to prescribed medication"".
In a statement released on social media, Woods said: ""I'm currently receiving professional help to manage my medications and the ways that I deal with back pain and a sleep disorder.
""I want to thank everyone for the amazing outpouring of support and understanding, especially the fans and players on tour.""
Woods has not won a tournament anywhere since 2013, while his title drought in major championships dates back to 2008.
Last December, he came back after 15 months out injured but has not played since his back problems recurred in February.
A month ago, he wrote that his latest surgery had relieved pain and that he had not ""felt this good in years"".
Four days later he was arrested on the driving charge, which he is due to answer in court in Palm Beach County on 9 August."

""I think it's important for the senior players in the team to stand up.
""We have a good blend of senior players and a lot of young Welsh talent in the likes of Aneurin Donald and Kiran Carlson.
""We've refocused and we're ready for Friday's game against Leicestershire and it will be nice to start off with a win.
""I've always been of the belief that in County Cricket as soon as you can gather some momentum you've got to try and carry it on for a long time.""
Glamorgan were beaten by an innings and 22 runs by Northants in their opening game of the season before an eight-wicket loss at home to Worcestershire.
Despite his side's poor start to the season, South African Rudolph still believes Glamorgan can make an impression in Division Two of the County Championship.
""If you look at last season we started with three losses and during the season there were about three or four games where we just missed out on winning opportunities,"" Rudolph told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
""If that had happened we would still have finished in the top three or four so it's not all doom and gloom at the moment."""
"The drones will be used to scan and assess Easyjet planes and report damage back to engineers.
The flying robots are being developed by a team that includes experts from the University of Bristol.
Easyjet is also developing virtual reality video technology.
In addition, Easyjet wants apps to help with maintenance, and the airline is fitting ""paperless plane"" technology. Durable laptop computers will replace printed navigational charts in planes.
""We have examined and assessed cutting edge technology across many different industries and are now applying a range of new technologies to the aviation sector for the first time to help us run our fleet of aircraft more effectively, efficiently and safely,"" said chief executive Carolyn McCall.
Easyjet plans to test the drones within coming months.
""Aircraft inspection is a great application for drones,"" said Dr Arthur Richards, head of aerial robotics at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory.
""Coupled with smart navigation and computer vision, they can get accurate data from really awkward places.""
The flying robots are being developed by Bristol Robotics Laboratory, a collaboration between University of Bristol and the University of West England.
Drone company Coptercraft and software company Measurement Solutions are also involved in the project.
The drones are fitted with high definition video cameras, but can also use lasers to scan the outside of the aircraft, Easyjet head of engineering Ian Davies told the BBC.
""We could zoom [the laser scanner] up and down the aircraft and map the surface,"" he said. ""If we've mapped the aeroplane we can have a complete history of its full life.""
He added that it is safer to have drones working at height than humans having to go up on a rig.
One of the main challenges for the drones is how to get them to work outside in windy conditions, Mr Richards said.
The drones are built to be light in weight, but that can make them vulnerable to gusts of wind on an airfield.
They plan to use research into how animals such as bees and birds cope with blustery weather to ""see how nature solves the same problem"".
Another challenge is to automate drone flights, he added.
Easyjet is also hoping to use virtual reality to help sort out technical problems with planes that are a long way from its engineering team.
At the moment engineers and pilots email pictures and call Easyjet's control centre to try to resolve issues over the phone.
But Easyjet is planning to use hi-tech glasses that can relay high definition video images back to base.
Engineers could be directed to do repairs by a team looking at the video stream coming from the glasses, Mr Davies said.
The technology also uses ""augmented reality"", where a computer image is superimposed on the view as seen through the glasses.
For example, an engineer can compare an image of a fuselage projected onto the glasses with the actual fuselage, to see what work needs to be done.
""It's a very simple Robocop outfit people would wear,"" Mr Davies said. ""We are using the human almost like a robot.""
The airline wants to use the technology in airports such as Sharm el Sheikh and Tel Aviv.
At the moment, the data is transmitted using 4G, but Easyjet is discussing options for satellite links with communications company Iridium, Mr Davies said.
When choosing the type of glasses to use, Easyjet evaluated Google Glass, but found the technology ""too fragile for industrial use"", he added.
There has been a surge in interest in drones in recent years, and they are being developed for a variety of uses.
The United Arab Emirates wants to use small government drones to provide services, like ID-card delivery, by next year.
Google bought solar-powered drone maker Titan Aerospace in April to help the firm's efforts to expand internet access.
Amazon is in the process of testing drones for deliveries, and a photographic drone that uses a dog-lead as a fail-safe has been developed."
"George Wharton, 14, and Rhy Baker, 13, died when Thomas McMeekin crashed into a tree in Morley, near Leeds, on 7 March.
The defendant and a teenage passenger were also left paralysed by the crash, Leeds Crown Court was told.
McMeekin, of Bruntcliffe Road, Morley, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving.
One witness told the hearing McMeekin had driven ""like a lunatic"".
He was accused of ""showing off"" while driving the car, which had been bought for him by his mother just five days before the crash.
The court heard he had advertised ""lifts cheaper than taxis"" on social media.

"Relatives say they have evidence that she was murdered as part of a policy of deliberately killing journalists.
The wrongful death lawsuit was filed at a district court in Washington DC.
Colvin was reporting from the rebel-held area of Baba Amr, in Homs, in February 2012, when she was killed by government artillery.
Shortly before, she did live broadcasts for the BBC, Channel Four and CNN.
""I watched a little baby die today,"" she said, talking over pictures of a child who had been hit by a sniper bullet. ""That is happening over and over and over.""
She told the BBC that President Assad's forces were ""shelling with impunity, with merciless disregard for civilians"".
She told CNN it was ""a complete and utter lie that they're only going after terroristsâ€¦ The Syrian army is simply shelling a city of cold, starving civilians"".
The Colvin family believes that the satellite phone used in these broadcasts was traced by Syrian intelligence and used to locate the Baba Amr media centre, where she was based.
According to documents obtained by their lawyers, a government informant then confirmed the location. An attack on the journalists was ordered that night, the lawsuit says.
""The transmissions were intercepted, and they were tracked to their GPS co-ordinates,"" said one of the legal team, Scott Gilmore.
""On top of that there was a whole web of informants who were already out searching for the journalists. Any journalist in Homsâ€¦ could have been a target"".
Marie's photographer, Paul Conroy, had told the BBC shortly after the attack that the incoming rounds were ""bracketed"" on the media centre, meaning they were being deliberately targeted.
Conroy had served in an artillery regiment in the British Army.
""As an artilleryman, I think that was a good day's work for a for a well-trained team. Nothing smacked of randomness in that situation,"" he said.
Now the family's lawyers say they have witnesses and documents smuggled out of Syria to prove this.
The lawsuit is the fruit of four years of research by the US-based Center for Justice and Accountability.
The documents are said to show that the artillery strike was approved or ordered by President Assad's brother Maher, commander of the Republican Guards.
The policy of targeting journalists is alleged to have been made by senior officials in the Central Crisis Management Cell, President Assad's war cabinet.
""I'm really proud to be able to bring this lawsuit,"" said Marie Colvin's sister, Cat. ""We know who Marie's killers are now; we want them brought to justice. I want them to be held accountable.""
She went on: ""I'm very sensitive to the suffering of the Syrian people. I know I'm not the only one who's lost a sister and my mom is not the only one who is mourning the loss of a daughter.
""I'm in a unique position to be able to use the court to be able be bring Marie's killers to justice. I want to give a voice to the Syrian people. I want them to know we haven't forgotten them.""
The shelling in Baba Amr was the most intense any of us in the BBC team had ever seen.
The Syrians there were all wondering if this would be another Hama - the town destroyed by the old President Assad's artillery in 1982. Some 10,000-20,000 people were killed - there is still no accurate estimate - but not a single image was published of the carnage.
In the age of the cameraphone and YouTube, that was not going to happen in Baba Amr.
But - we believed - the regime still feared what effect the presence of international journalists would have.
""We could destroy Baba Amr in 10 minutes, if there were no cameras,"" a regime official is supposed to have said, according to documents and witness statements obtained by the Colvin family's lawyers.
The lawsuit says Marie was deliberately murdered according to orders given by some of the most senior officials in the Syrian regime.
One of those who helped carry out the attack is said to have been rewarded by the Assad family with the gift of a car.
These are allegations, yet to be tested in court. But the murder of journalists is just one war crime among many of which the regime stands accused.
The Colvin family hopes the lawsuit will be a reminder of that - as some in the international community seek to rehabilitate President Assad."
"Like a sort of officially sanctioned graffiti, the initials of the housing department of Rio de Janeiro were sprayed on homes marked for demolition.
Almost 900 families, many of which lived on Rua da Esperanca (Hope Street), were facing eviction because their houses stood in the way of the planned route for the Transolimpica bus rapid transit system (BRT).
The extension of the BRT is part of the upgrades planned ahead of the 2016 Olympic Games, which the city is hosting.
The new 25km (15 mile) rapid bus route is expected to carry 70,000 passengers a day.
It will link Barra da Tijuca, which will host the athletes' village, to Deodoro, the venue for several Olympic events.
Rio City Hall intended to relocate the families from Vila Uniao to small social housing apartments or offer compensation packages.
But many residents did not want to leave their 30-year-old community.
After two years of uncertainty and a small yet vocal campaign of resistance, they have managed to save it from demolition.
Instead of running straight over the neighbourhood, the new $555m-bus system (Â£370m) will now cut around Vila Uniao.
This means only 191 families will need to be relocated, a 78% reduction in the original number of expected evictions.
""We're celebrating a lot because it was 900 families and now it's 191,"" said Robson da Silva Soares, one of those leading the resistance to the demolition of Vila Uniao.
But the victory was bittersweet for the residents, who, in 2012, had been promised investment as part of an initiative to improve the city's poor neighbourhoods by 2020.
Months later, the Transolimpica project was announced and along with it, the need to relocate hundreds of families.
Many of the homes earmarked for demolition were bigger than the government-funded apartments residents were being offered, explained 68-year-old Francisco Gabriel.
""I've been here 20 years and if it's a choice between leaving for the [government-funded] Colonia Juliano Moreira apartments or staying here, I'd prefer to stay here,"" he said.
""The homes there are smaller.""
According to Rio City Hall, plans for the Transolimpica were redrawn to reduce the impact on Vila Uniao.
""We managed to get public land belonging to the federal government to alter the project and attend to the needs of the residents,"" a spokesman said.
Rio City Hall said the project, while causing disruption to some, also had huge potential to improve the lives of locals by linking their neighbourhood to other public transport lines.
""The future corridor will benefit the population leaving a huge legacy of mobility: a fully integrated transport network with the Transoeste and Transcarioca BRTs already opened, and the rail network in Deodoro,"" officials said.
But while the reduced number of evictions was welcomed by the majority in Vila Uniao, it did not satisfy everyone, leaving the community divided.
Cintia Neves, who runs a lunchtime cafe in the neighbourhood, has lived here almost her whole life.
The 26-year-old shares the house her late father built when she was six months old with her mother and brother.
""The vast majority [in the community] think the change is good but there are some who wanted to leave,"" she says, explaining that some homes in Vila Uniao were barely more than hovels.
""We are staying for now"" she said about her family.
But even though the relief of those residents whose homes have been saved is palpable the new route is still likely to affect the community.
There is the local football pitch, for example. The original plan spared it but the new project runs over it instead.
Rio City Hall said it was in talks with the owner of a local football ground to provide a new pitch.
There were also concerns that those moving to the new social housing would lose the community feel they enjoyed in Vila Uniao.
""I grew up in the community with my parents and four brothers,"" Mr Soares said.
""There's a market, a bank, a school. But the place where the families are moving to doesn't have any of this. They have to start everything again.""
Mr Soares said he and his fellow campaigners would not give up: ""My house was in the path of the BRT and now I don't have to leave.
""But even so, I will continue with the same fight because independent of me, we're fighting for residents to have their rights.""
And he is confident he can drive down the number of those facing eviction even further. ""We see the possibility of removing fewer still than 191,"" the 37-year-old electromechanical technician said."
"It was the moment a man, hands open in peace, stood up to a swastika-tattooed neo-nazi with his fists clenched in rage. A striking picture, taken by photographer Kenji Wardenclyffe, captured the explosive moment during a Melbourne protest against the 'Islamisation' of Australia. The dramatic scenes occurred after Reclaim Australia, an anti-Islam group, organised protests at major cities across Australia, which were countered by anti-racism activists who held rallies in the same locations. The Reclaim Australia event in Melbourne was also crashed by neo-nazis, who spectacularly clashed with anti-racism groups. Scroll down for video . A number of men with shaved heads and tattoos of the swastika (left) appeared at the event and attempted to start a fight with anti-racism protesters (right) 'It was very intense,' Kenji Wardenclyffe told Daily Mail Australia. 'The neo-nazi definitely seemed to be instigating, trying to start a fight with the anti-racism group. The other man in the photo stepped in and was trying to keep the peace. 'He kept his hands open, he was trying to stop a fight from breaking out.' The violent intent of the bald man was proven elsewhere at the rally, when he was photographed with one fist gripping another protester's shirt and the other raised to punch the man in the face. Violent intent: At the rally, the man involved in the standoff was seen trying to throw a punch at another protester as the scene descended into violence . One man appeared to be knocked out cold in the melee and was left lying on the ground . Mr Wardenclyffe said he was pushed around by protesters throughout the day, and some of his camera equipment was broken by people attempting to stop him from taking photos. 'It was a very angry atmosphere - it definitely seemed some of the people on the Reclaim Australia side were there looking to start a fight,' he said. 'It was very tense.' In a video of the event, it also appears to show the moment a man throw a punch at the head of a female anti-racism protester. Despite Reclaim Australia's promise of a peaceful protest, a number of men with shaved heads and tattoos of the swastika appeared at the event and attempted to intimidate anti-racism protesters. Reclaim Australia describe themselves as 'patriotic Australians' who protest against Sharia Law, Halal tax and Islam. They say they want 'compulsory singing of our national anthem weekly in every school in Australia' and want the government to 'refuse entry to anyone who has fought overseas against our ADF or minimum 15 years jail term.' In these photos, taken by freelance photographer Kenji Wardenclyffe, a man with a swastika tattoo came head to head with one of the anti-racism protesters and attempted to intimidate them into backing off. Wearing a Harley Davidson sleeveless hoodie, which showed off his sleeve of tattoos, the bald man attempted to start a fight with the protesters against racism, who stood against him in defiance . Police were forced to separate the neo-Nazis and opposing protesters by forming a wall at separate rallies across the country .

Police were forced to separate  supporters and opposing protesters by forming a wall at separate rallies across the country. Crowd numbers continued to grow throughout the afternoon, and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics after the ugly clashes. Speaking to Buzzfeed, photographer Mr Wardenclyffe said one of the anti-racism protesters stood out in front of the rest to stop him from getting through. 'The neo-Nazi appeared and pushed through the crowd and began to yell at the (left-wing protestors),' Mr Wardenclyffe said. Police were forced to separate Reclaim Australia supporters and opposing protesters by forming a wall at separate rallies across the country . 'The neo-Nazi then got in the face of the man in my photo with sunglasses who had moved into a position to prevent him from getting through. 'The neo-Nazi yelled at him in a manner which seemed to be an attempt to start a fight, but the guy with sunglasses remained calm and didn’t engage.' A clash of anti-Islam and anti-racism groups turned dangerous and violent during protests in Melbourne . Melbourne police formed a barrier between the separate rallies to attempt to disperse the protesters . It comes after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups has mocked protests . There was never a violent exchange between the groups however the men with the swastika's moved through the crowd taunting the anti-racism protesters. The clash comes after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups mocked  protests being held around Australia last week. However, organisers behind the Sydney protest were quick to disassociate themselves with the account. Crowd numbers grew during the afternoon, and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics . Across Australia, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, but Sydney and Melbourne drew the biggest crowd . 'It's not us,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'Ours is @reclaim_aus.' Across the country, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, with events in Sydney and Melbourne appearing to have drawn the biggest crowds. About 500 people attended the rally held in Martin Place, Sydney, which included speeches from former Australia Defence League member Shermon Burgess and Rise Up! Australia Party NSW President Norm Bishop. Two people were taken away by police officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally . More than 100 police officers, eleven mounted on horses were used to form the separation wall . Several were injured during the violent rally that saw hundreds of people protest for anti-racism . There was a strong police presence throughout the protest, which included riot police. Two people were taken away by officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally.

"It was Ava Gardner's 'little London retreat' and now a slice of it could be yours for an eye-watering £500,000 per year. The Hollywood siren called the building, just a short walk from Harrods in London's exclusive Knightsbridge, home until her death in 1990. Now this newly refurbished five bedroom, five bathroom apartment gives renters the chance to walk in the footsteps of the legendary screen star. Spread over 3,054 square feet it boasts two spacious reception rooms, a study and a modern state-of-the art kitchen and breakfast room. Scroll down for video . Ava Gardner called 34 Ennismore Gardens her 'little London retreat' and now a slice of it could be yours for £10,500 per week . Through the key hole: The apartment features two stunning reception rooms and renters can boast that the buildings corridors were once graced by the screen icon . Luxury: The apartment, which is a short walk from Harrods and Hyde Park, boasts a total of five bedrooms and five bathrooms . Screen icon: Ava Gardner pictured with a cigarette in hand looks happy and relaxed in her 'little London retreat' The beauty, who was the second wife of crooner Frank Sinatra, moved to London in 1968 and made 34 Ennismore Gardens her primary residence for over 20 years. She once said of the property: 'I love the history and grandeur of my little London retreat, some say it is too big for me alone, but I love the space.' The grand apartment, in the same building where Gardner lived, is entered through a sweeping entrance hall. The master bedroom suite has walk in wardrobes and there are also two further bedroom suites and two guest bedrooms. The apartment has views of beautiful private gardens and renters will also enjoy access to the large private garden square. Reaching the pinnacle of Hollywood fame in the 1950s,  Gardner was listed 25th among the American Film Institute's Greatest Female Stars. She starred in films such as The Killers, 55 Days at Peking and The Night of the Iguana. The pin-up girl of her era, Gardner had high-profile marriages to Mickey Rooney and Frank Sinatra; and it was her marriage to Sinatra that was credited for his Oscar-winning performance in From Here to Eternity, which re-launched his singing career. The apartment in her building is being offered for rent by Tunstall Property for £10,500 per week, which equates to £546,000 per year. The homes along Ennismore Gardens have a long history, built in 1870 as part of the redevelopment of Kingston House, a Palladian mansion dating back to the 18th Century, belonging to Elizabeth Chudleigh, Duchess of Kingston. Dinning in style: Spread over 3,054 square feet it boasts two spacious reception rooms, a study and a modern state-of-the art kitchen and breakfast room . State-of-the art: A sleek and modern kitchen has been created within the building which dates back to 1870 . Brush with Hollywood: The spacious and luxurious bathroom features marble topped sinks and bath . Room with a view: The apartment provides views onto private gardens at the front and rear of the building, with residents enjoying access to the large private garden square on Ennismore Gardens . Tasteful: Another of the apartments five bedrooms decorated in neutral shades of grey . Screen siren: The Hollywood actress was the second wife of singer Frank Sinatra. Their union only lasted two years because they were both 'high-strung people', Gardner later claimed. The mansion and its estate was later sold to William Hare, Baron of Ennismore, in 1837, but was sold off for development following his death, with the street and private gardens named to commemorate him. Once completed the five-storey homes along Ennismore Gardens, designed with Porticos and Corinthian Columns, commanded a premium of £17,000 per year. Mark Tunstall, Managing Director of Tunstall Property, commented: 'This property is just steeped in history, with corridors once graced by Ava Gardner. It is in a quiet yet well-connected pocket of prime central London and with five bedrooms provides space for all the family. 'The location is hard to beat, with Hyde Park and Harrods on the doorstep, as well as the Royal Albert Hall and museums and bistros of South Kensington a short stroll away. This home meets every requirement, providing; space, amenities and location.'"

"Cambridge University Press is analysing media coverage during Brazil 2014 and scoring 'confidence levels' out of 100.
The score rises and falls dependent on the words used to describe England.
Confidence was measured at 38 after the 2-2 draw with Ecuador on 4 June and 40 following the 0-0 draw with Honduras on 8 June but rose to 77 a day later.
England's current rating is 70, going into the game in Manaus, according to the Cambridge Confidence Index.
Researchers have analysed and assessed millions of words from a wide range of media sources over the past two weeks.
Cambridge University Press's Dr Claire Dembry said: ""The breadth of sources means we're able to give a unique insight into the mood surrounding the England team.
""It's interesting to see that the nation is in confident spirits ahead of the Italy game, despite some fairly lacklustre performances against Ecuador and Honduras.""
Words such as ""progress"",  ""strong"" and ""joy"" have increasingly been used by players, coaching staff and fans.
Midfielder Adam Lallana, 26, and 18-year-old Luke Shaw, who are both seeking to leave Southampton, have been described more positively than any other England player.
Neymar, who scored twice in Brazil's 3-1 victory over Croatia, was the most talked about player after the opening match.
""Controversial"" was identified as the word of the day following the disputed penalty for Brazil's first goal and anti-World Cup protests in several host cities.
Cambridge will track positive and negative indicators throughout the tournament, in order to measure changes in the perceived confidence in the England team."
"Energy drinks like Red Bull are causing children to behave badly, a teaching union has claimed . Pupils’ excessive consumption of energy drinks is fuelling deteriorating behaviour, it has been claimed. Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, likened the caffeinated refreshments to ‘readily available legal highs’. Some children drink ‘excessive’ amounts of Red Bull, Monster and Relentless, causing ‘hyperactivity’ and an ‘inevitable crash’ later, the teaching union said. Of the 3,500 teachers it surveyed, 13 per cent cited ‘use of caffeine and energy drinks … as a driver of poor pupil behaviour’. The teaching union is now working with national drug and alcohol charity, Swanswell, to provide pupils, parents and schools with advice on energy drinks. The move comes as doctors warned last week that the drinks can trigger heart problems in healthy teenagers. Miss Keates said: ‘This is the first time we have seen a significant number of teachers beginning to raise this as a concern. ‘These drinks are becoming increasingly popular among young people and are often seen as simply like any other soft drink, but many young people and their parents are not aware of the very high levels of stimulants that these drinks contain.’ She added: ‘Teachers are growing increasingly concerned that some young people are using these drinks to enable them to stay up into the early hours of the morning and then replace their lost energy by drinking two or three cans of these drinks on their way to school. ‘Teachers are reporting that this affects concentration in class and hyperactivity is then followed by the inevitable crash later in the school day when the impact of these drinks wear off. ‘Parents and young people need to be made aware of what these drinks contain and their potential impact on behaviour.’ There is no recommendation around how much caffeine people should drink each day, according to a briefing document prepared for the NASUWT by Swanswell. However, the Food Standards Agency recommends that children should only consume caffeine in moderation. As a result, it would ‘seem logical that children should consume a maximum of 200mg of caffeine per day, as recommended for pregnant women’. Children and pregnant women could drink five 500ml bottles of cola before reaching this daily limit for caffeine intake. However, they could only have one of the top five energy drink brands to get to this 200mg level, according to the report. Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT (pictured), likened the caffeinated refreshments to ‘readily available legal highs’ It also points to a Danish study that revealed over 40 per cent of energy drink consumers experienced insomnia, restlessness and heart palpitations. Twenty per cent of those aged 10 to 14 consume too much caffeine and have a ‘limited knowledge of the ingredients in energy drinks and the side effects associated with them’, the research found. Debbie Bannigan, chief executive of Swanswell, said: ‘As a provider of drug and alcohol services for young people we’re concerned about excessive energy drink consumption, not least because we’re finding links to use of other substances, including alcohol, cannabis and mephadrone.’ Cardiologists in Madrid last week said the energy drinks, which contain large amounts of caffeine, may trigger sudden heart attacks and erratic heartbeats in young, apparently healthy, people."
"It’s that time of year when the English challenge in Europe fades in the face of overwhelming firepower and the thorny issue of the salary cap re-surfaces. This time, Dai Young has sounded the annual alarm. Wasps’ director of rugby could not have asked much more from his gallant side as they pushed Toulon all the way before losing their Champions Cup quarter-final at Stade Felix Mayol on Sunday. Yet, the scale of what they were up against was illustrated by the sight of Matt Giteau and Juan Fernandez Lobbe – two of the world’s finest players – coming on as replacements for the hosts. A pair of Springboks, Bryan Habana and Juan Smith, were among a glittering non-playing contingent. Wasps coach Dai Young has called for reform to the Premiership salary cap so English clubs can compete on the European stage - the comments came after his team lost 32-18 to Toulon on Sunday . Lozowski makes a diving pass while his ankle is grasped by the Toulon player on the ground . Toulon's English speedster Delon Armitage makes a break for the defending champions . CLERMONT v SARACENS, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, St Etienne, Saturday, April 18, 3.15pm (GMT) TOULON v LEINSTER, Stade Vélodrome, Marseille, Sunday,     April 19, 3.15pm (GMT) Young quipped that the absence of Leigh Halfpenny from the Toulon ranks meant that Wasps only had ‘about five world-class full-backs to worry about’. The joke hinted at a more serious point; the personnel gulf between the wealthy French elite and their Premiership rivals. The English clubs simply can’t compete when the leading Top 14 sides play to their potential, due to the disparity in budgets. Yet again, the salary cap — currently £5.5million — is back on the agenda. ‘There are pros and cons for everything,’ said Young. ‘The salary cap has worked; all the clubs have been sustainable for a long period, it’s the most competitive league in Europe and there have been two or three different title winners in the last few seasons, too. Wasps' No 10 Alex Lozowski kicks away from Michalak during their European Champions Cup quarter-final . Toulon playmaker Frederic Michalak pulls the strings for the defending European champions . ‘It has also meant a lot of young English players are getting exposure at that level, so it has done what it was intended to do. But maybe we need a a re-think about how important Europe is to the English teams and how the salary cap leaves us when playing against the big French teams. ‘Realistically, Premiership teams need a bit of luck to arrive at these games with their best team fit. With the salary cap, there’s no way we can match the massive squads these clubs have.’ Wasps couldn’t match Toulon’s depth of playing resources, but they did trouble the holders thanks to the dynamic efforts of two young Englishmen — centre Elliot Daly and scrum-half Joe Simpson. Their electric running maintained the form Young believes should put them in contention for a place in England’s World Cup squad. ‘I don’t know what more they can do,’ said the Welshman. ‘If England want to win the World Cup, these are the type of players you have to get in your team.’ New Zealander Williams rises to celebrate his try which came minutes after he should have been sin-binned . Ali Williams crosses for a late try for Toulon as they put victory over Wasps on Sunday beyond doubt ."
"Thursday will mark three weeks since Saudi Arabia began airstrikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen. But there is as yet little sign that the rebels are being driven back, that the fighting in Yemen is dying down or that lives there are being saved. To the contrary, increasingly more Yemenis appear to be fleeing the country, attempting the dangerous trip in rickety fishing boats across the Red Sea to the Horn of Africa -- a trip historically made by people fleeing Africa rather than the other way around. Hopes for stability, not only in Yemen but in the Middle East in general, are fading as fears grow that Saudia Arabia and Iran are fighting a proxy war in Yemen for regional domination. And the number of dead continues to mount. Yemen's health ministry said over the weekend that 385 civilians had been killed and 342 others had been wounded. The World Health Organization has put a higher figure on both tolls -- 648 killed and 2,191 wounded -- but includes militant casualties in the totals. The Houthis forced Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January, though Hadi still claims he is Yemen's legitimate leader and is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to Yemen. Those allied with Hadi have accused the Iranian government of supporting the Houthis in their uprising in Yemen. Like the Iranians, the Houthis are Shiites. And like the Saudis, Hadi and his government are Sunni. Since it began on March 26, Saudi Arabia has launched more than 1,200 airstrikes. Saudi officials claim to have killed more than 500 Houthi rebels. The U.N. Security Council voted Tuesday in favor of an arms embargo on Houthis -- the minority group that has taken over large swaths of Yemen, including its capital, Sanaa -- and supporters of former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The resolution ""raises the cost"" for the Houthis, according to Mark Lyall Grant, Britain's ambassador to the United Nations. In addition to the arms embargo, the resolution also demands that the Shiite group pull back and refrain from more violence and includes sanctions aimed at controlling the spread of terrorism, according to Grant. Russia abstained from Tuesday's vote, saying it didn't like the inclusion of sanctions. Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen?"
"A farmer from eastern China has found himself the talk of the country after one of his goats gave birth to a kid with six legs. The 20-day-old 'spider goat' - as it has been (inaccurately) nicknamed by Chinese web users - was born with four forelegs and two hind legs. Xiao Qibin, owner of the farm, said the baby goat is growing quickly and healthily with 'an extraordinary appetite', the People's Daily Online reports. Rare: This six-legged kid has become a star animal in China since it was born 20 days ago . Mr Xiao started running his goat farm in Chaohu in Anhui Province about a year ago and owns more than 400 goats. 'During the labour, I saw the nanny goat was having difficulty,' said Mr Xiao. 'I saw two legs came out at first, but surprisingly another four followed when the kid was fully born,' he added. Mr Xiao said at first he wasn't sure if the mutant goat - which weighed 5kg at birth - would survive. However, the kid is healthy and growing quickly - and has become one of the most playful goats on the farm. 'He can eat a lot,' added the farmer. Playful:  Miss Ge, an employee at Xiao Qibin's farm, takes care of the playful baby goat every day . The kid's six legs were of similar length initially, but as he grew two of the forelegs became shorter than the rest and can no longer touch the ground. Mr Xiao said the six-legged kid was born to two normal 'lake goats' and he was puzzled as to what caused the mutation. He said he will not take the kid to the vet to remove the two extra legs. 'I want him to grow up naturally and happily,' said Mr Xiao. Healthy: Mr Xiao said the goat is growing quickly and has become one of the most playful animals on the farm ."
"Arrest: Rachel Lehnardt, 35, allegedly threw a drunken party for her 16-year-old daughter . A mother-of-five threw her teenage daughter a party, played naked Twister with her friends and then had sex with an 18-year-old in the bathroom, authorities have said. Rachel Lynn Lehnardt, 35, from Evans, Georgia, was arrested on Saturday night and has been charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The details of the drunken party emerged when Lehnardt met with her Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor last Friday and told her about the wild party. The sponsor then contacted authorities. She told the woman that her children, who are aged between four and 16, were with their father when her oldest daughter texted her to ask if she could bring over some friends. Lehnardt allegedly responded: 'Come on, let's party', WJBF reported. When the teenagers arrived, she allegedly allowed them to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana in her home, before she played naked Twister with them in the living room. While the youngsters continued playing, she allegedly went into a bathroom and had sex with an 18-year-old man, the sponsor told authorities. When she returned, she brought out sex toys and started to use them on herself in front of the teenagers, she told her sponsor, Augusta Crime reported. Party: The mother-of-five allegedly played naked Twister with her daughter and her friends before having sex with an 18-year-old male in the bathroom. She later had sex with her daughter's 16-year-old boyfriend . She later went to bed alone and around 3.30am, she awoke to find someone having sex with her, she told her sponsor. 'She stated at first she thought it was the 18-year-old from earlier, but then realized it was the 16-year-old who was in fact her daughter's boyfriend,' Lehnardt's sponsor told deputies. The daughter told her mother she felt guilty because the boyfriend's 10-inch penis was so large she could not have sex with him, and he needed to have sex with her mother instead. While the incident sounds as if the 16-year-old raped the mother, Sheriff's spokesman Captain Steve Morris said there was no evidence of a crime and no charges are pending against the boy. No sexual crime charges have been filed against Lehnardt because 16 is the legal age of consent. Lehnardt also allegedly told the sponsor that she had shown her daughter explicit photos, including of Lehnardt having sex with her boyfriend. The sponsor said that the mother has also previously spoken about being a porn addict. Scene: She allegedly threw the party at her home in Evans, Georgia, pictured, and lost custody of her children after the incident. She has been charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor . Following the incident, an emergency custody hearing was held and she lost custody of her five children, who are aged four, six, eight, 10 and 16, WJBF reported. At their meeting last week, the sponsor asked Lehnardt how long she had been sober and her future plans for sobriety, and the mother told her about losing custody of the children days before. After their meeting, the woman, who was only recently assigned to sponsor Lehnardt, contacted the Columbia County Sheriff's Office and the mother was arrested on Saturday. She has been released from the Columbia County Detention Center after posting a $3,200 bond, according to the Columbia County News-Times. According to online profiles, Lehnardt crafts and paints dolls. The children's father is in the military. Lehnardt was arrested after sharing details of the incident with her Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, who then went to authorities. As part of the AA's 12 Step program, members write a list of incidents they feel guilty about and confide in their sponsor about the acts (known as the Fifth Step). The person is then required to make amends for past wrongdoings, as long as doing so does not cause harm to others. While there is an expectation of anonymity at meetings, there is no guarantee, and experts recommend exercising caution when detailing crimes, according to The Fix. AA literature simply states that 'anonymity provides protection for all members from identification as alcoholics'. The main 'Understanding Anonymity' booklet does not mention safety from disclosure of a crime and there have been multiple cases of AA members being convicted of crimes, including, murder after confessing to their sponsors. But there has also been some debate over whether the confessions can be used in court. In 2001, a 1995 murder conviction was thrown out after it was ruled that a killer's confession to fellow AA members was constitutionally protected and shouldn't have been used against him. The decision was reached after the judge deemed the 12 Step program had religious undertones, meaning that the members engaged in  religious activity, which is constitutionally protected."
"Wallace's name might not have the same cachet as Keegan, Dalglish or Rush but his place in Liverpool history is unassailable - he scored the club's first European goal.
His landmark moment came in Iceland when he opened the scoring in a 5-0 win over K.R. Knattspyrnufélag Reykjavíkur in 1964.
""The great Roger Hunt went to the by-line, squared it back to me and from all of those six yards out I powered it in,"" said Wallace who was only playing because Ian St John was ill.
It's more than 55 years since he left Llanelli for Liverpool, but Wallace has not lost a trace of his Welsh accent.
So how did the son of a Scotland international claim his place in footballing history? And why does he have a south Wales lilt when he speaks?
It's a story that takes in one of Wales' most famous rugby academies and Huddersfield Town. Wallace, now 71, recalls it all with fondness.
Wallace was five years old when his father, former Scotland centre forward Dougie Wallace, was appointed player-manager at Llanelli AFC.
As a teenager he went to Gwendraeth School, where Barry John - nicknamed The King - and before him Carwyn James took their first steps to rugby stardom.
""The school was rugby orientated. Barry was two years younger than me and even then I used to love to watch him play,"" Wallace told BBC Wales.
""But my childhood dream was to become a footballer. I wanted to be just like my dad.""
Wallace played in the Llanelli junior league between the ages of 11 to 14, before playing for Glan Morfa where his talent was discovered.
""It was late October 1959. I remember it well,"" he says of the day Bill Shankly's scout spotted him.
""There's somebody I want you to have a look at"" was the message sent back to Shankly, then manager of Huddersfield Town.
Wallace had trials with the Terriers and when Shankly went to Liverpool, he took Wallace with him.
""At the end of my third trial at Huddersfield, Bill Shankly signed on the Monday to become manager of Liverpool Football Club,"" Wallace continued.
After Liverpool won the Division One title in 1963-64, they were offered automatic qualification for the European Cup for the first time.
""Liverpool in the 60s was vibrant - The Beatles, 50,000 in the stadium, 28,000 in the Kop swaying to their songs. I remember it like yesterday,"" Wallace said.
""I wasn't always on the pitch but I was always part of the party. We had a fabulous squad. Ronnie Yates, Ian Callaghan, Roger Hunt, Ian St John. An odd person might get injured so you might get a game now and then.""
And it was sickness that gave Wallace his break when fellow Scot St John had suffered appendicitis a few weeks before Liverpool's first European tie in Iceland.
Wallace recalls the journey was as memorable as the game, ""Back then you couldn't get a direct flight to Iceland. We flew to Glasgow with a six-hour wait,
""[Shankly] didn't want us lounging around so off we went on a bus to a holiday camp. I'll always remember the fella stopping us at the gate.
""The boss went over and said, 'I'm Bill Shankly, I'm going to Reykjavik in Iceland and this is Liverpool Football Club'. The guy replied, 'Well you're on the wrong road, Mr Shankly, You should have taken a right back that way'.""
Wallace and the team got through the gate, onto the flight for Iceland, and a little piece of history followed.
""The goal came after three minutes,"" recalls Wallace, ""It hadn't dawned on me it was the first-ever goal in Europe until about six months later when someone mentioned it would be a good quiz question.""
He also played a leading part in another landmark game, scoring twice in a 3-2 win over Arsenal - a game televised by the BBC on the first Match of the Day.
He spent another two seasons at the club before moving on to Crewe Alexandra in 1967 for £9,000.
""I would have loved to have played a lot more games than what I did, but I was so proud to be part of that squad. Shankly started what Liverpool Football Club is today,"" he said.
Wallace draws comparisons between Shankly and current Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who has steered the club to Europa League final in his first season at Anfield.
""They're very, very similar,"" Wallace said, ""Klopp's so enthusiastic, he's got a great character about him. He's got the players motivated.
""The Dortmund game [where Liverpool fought back to win 5-4 on aggregate in the Europa League quarter-final] - that was second only to the Inter Milan [European Cup] semi-final [first leg] in 1965 [which Liverpool won 3-1].
""To see Klopp on the line, chanting and running, when the players see that, they play for him like we played for Shankly."""
"Two TSA employees have been fired after they used the airport body scanner inappropriately to allow the male worker to fondle male passengers' genitals. The pair allegedly worked as a team to manipulate the results of a full body scanner at a security check-point in Denver International Airport last year, CBS4 reported. According to a Denver Police Department report seen by Daily Mail Online, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) received an anonymous tip in November last year that an employee had admitted to 'groping' men who came through security. Scroll down for video . The male employee and a female accomplice allegedly worked as a team to manipulate the TSA screening system at Denver International airport in 2014 . According to the report: 'When a male he finds attractive comes to be screened by the scanning machine, he will alert another TSA screener to indicate to the scanning computer that the party being screened is female. 'When the screener does this, the scanning machine will indicate an anomaly in the genital area.' The male TSA employee would then perform pat downs of the male passenger's genitals at the Colorado airport. Despite receiving an employee tip-off to the alleged sexual assaults in November, the TSA only investigated in February. A TSA supervisor told police that he saw the male employee 'give a signal' then after the screening device showed the anomaly 'conduct a pat down of the passenger's front groin and buttocks area with the palms of his hands... contradictory to TSA searching policy'. The female employee was questioned and admitted she had taken part in the assaults on unsuspecting passengers a total of 11 times. Both employees were fired following the incident. The TSA said that efforts to find the male Southwest Airlines passenger who was targeted had been unsuccessful. No other complaints have been made. Denver Police Department were unable to file criminal charges because no victims had been identified. The TSA refused to provide the names of the employees involved. The agency told Daily Mail Online on Tuesday: 'These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable. TSA has removed the two officers from the agency. 'All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency. And when substantiated, employees are held accountable.' Passengers undergo full body scans by Transportation Security Administration agents at the Denver International Airport.

"Hilary Border, 54, stole £20,000 from her dementia-stricken mother, pictured outside Nottingham Crown Court . A 'wicked' daughter who stole £20,000 from her dementia-stricken mother and spent it on herself instead of paying care home fees has been spared jail. Hilary Border, 54, from Newark, Nottinghamshire, had power of attorney over her 83-year-old mother Dorothy's affairs when her health deteriorated. The mother-of-three was required to pay £300-a-week for the 83-year-old's care but when it doubled to £600 the money was either late or stopped being paid at all. Care home staff tried to contact Border over an outstanding £16,000 debt over two years before reporting her to police. She pleaded  guilty to fraud on the basis she took £20,000 between October 2012, and November 20 last year, despite the fact that prosecution said it was £39,500. Border was sentenced to 16 months in prison, suspended for two years, at Nottingham Crown Court yesterday. Judge Andrew Hamilton said: 'You stole money from your mum. You were trusted to be her power of attorney to deal with her money. 'It was wicked to steal from someone who was in a care home. 'The owners of the care home seem to have taken pity on your mum. Others might not have been so charitable. 'She has dementia and doesn't appreciate the wickedness of her daughter, how you have betrayed her trust and stolen her money.' Border was also made subject of an eight-month home curfew and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. The court heard Border's mother suffered from angina, sclerosis of the liver and seriously low blood pressure. Defence attorney Ian Way said Border had taken a small amount of money to ease financial pressures in her own life and the fraud had then escalated. He added: 'She is 54, of good character. 'She is thoroughly ashamed for what she has done and full of self-loathing..' Border was sentenced to 16 months in prison, suspended for two years, at Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) yesterday ."
"Living near congested roads with high levels of air pollution can cause ‘silent strokes’ which increase the risk of dementia, scientists have warned. Exposure to small, sooty particles, mostly caused by traffic fumes and factory emissions, alters the structure of the brain, they said. The microscopic particles have previously been shown to cause lung damage and harmful changes in blood vessels and clotting, and are thought to contribute to the deaths of 29,000 people every year in Britain. Living near a congested road can increase the chance of developing dementia, research has found . Researchers examined the brains of more than 900 people aged more than 60 and assessed the pollution risk . US researchers found evidence that living near congested roads or polluted areas can lead to ‘silent strokes’ which in turn cause shrinkage of the brain and other damage. Silent strokes, which arise from blockages in blood vessels supplying the brain, do not have any outward symptoms and the victim is usually unaware of them. Sudha Seshadri, a professor of neurology at Boston University School of Medicine, said: ‘This is concerning, since we know that silent strokes increase the risk of overt strokes and of developing dementia, walking problems and depression. ‘We now plan to look more at the impact of air pollution over a longer period, its effect on brain shrinkage over time, and other risks including stroke and dementia.’ The study, by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Boston University School of Medicine, involved more than 900 people aged 60 and over who did not have dementia or a history of strokes. It recorded how far participants lived from major roads and used satellite imagery to assess their exposure to the fine particulate matter known as PM2.5. This is made up of small particles measuring just 2.5 micrometres, or 30 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair. These particles are generated from a variety of sources, including power plants, factories, trucks and cars and the burning of wood. They can travel deeply into the lungs and have been associated with increased numbers of hospital admissions for heart attacks and strokes. The study participants’ brain matter was measured using MRI scans. The researchers found that increases in PM2.5 in towns and cities was linked with a 46 per cent higher risk of silent strokes. The research was published in a report in the journal Stroke. Researcher Elissa Wilker, of the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Research Unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said: ‘This is one of the first studies to look at the relationship between ambient air pollution and brain structure. ‘Our findings suggest that air pollution is associated with insidious effects, even in dementia and stroke-free individuals. ‘The mechanisms remain unclear, but inflammation resulting from the deposit of fine particles in the lungs is likely important.’ The study will add to mounting pressure on the Government, which faces a judgment at the Supreme Court next week over its failure to meet EU legal limits for air pollution. Sixteen cities – including London, Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield and Birmingham – have failed to hit air quality targets."
"The 19-year-old was held in Barking on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.
Police said six other suspects remain in custody and searches are ongoing.
Eight people were killed when three men drove at pedestrians on the bridge and stabbed people in Borough Market.
The man arrested on Sunday is being held at a police station in south London.
The six men still in custody, all aged between 27 and 30, were also arrested in east London - four in Ilford, one in Newham and one in Barking.
Thirteen people arrested as part of the investigation have been released without charge, while a 33-year-old man held in Ilford on 8 June has been bailed.
Over the weekend, police released images of fake explosive belts worn by the three attackers, named as Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba.
Borough Market is hoping to re-open ""later this week"", managing director Darren Henaghan has said.
Traders were officially given access to the market on Monday - for the first time since the terror attack - to allow them to start clearing up and prepare to resume business.
On Saturday night, bars and restaurants across the capital donated money to a British Red Cross UK fund for victims of terror attacks and their families, as Londoners were encouraged to show ""unity and resilience"" a week after the attack.
The fund has raised more than Â£700,000 since it started on 4 June.
And on Sunday, Southwark Cathedral - which had been cordoned off in the days after the attack - re-opened its doors for the first time."
"The number of hayfever sufferers in the UK is predicted to reach 20 million this summer, up a third from last year as warm weather bathes the country. For many, the glorious sunshine and promise of temperatures warmer than the Mediterranean this week will come as a welcome relief. But for millions, the  first tentative steps towards summer brings impending misery as a dreaded cloud of invisible pollen descends. Experts told MailOnline that five million people are expected to fall victim to the symptoms  - which include streaming eyes, incessant sneezing and irritating itches at the back of the throat - for the first time. Around 20 million people in the UK are expected to suffer hayfever symptoms this summer, up a third from last year, experts told MailOnline . And by 2030 that figure is expected to surge to 31.8 million sufferers. Dr Jean Emberlin, a leading pollen expert, told MailOnline that a 33 per cent rise in the number of people struck by hayfever this year could occur, 'depending on weather conditions'. She said: 'If we get prolonged periods of warm, dry weather with intervals of some wet weather between, which helps the grass to keep growing, we will experience a lot of high grass pollen counts. 'Grass is the main culprit pollen for hayfever in the UK. 'High and very high pollen counts can trigger hayfever symptoms in people who have not had them before. She added: 'In addition, the good weather typically brings increases in air pollution, which can make symptoms worse, and again lead them to occur in people who have been symptom free before.' In addition, she said pollen is becoming more potent, and greater numbers of plants giving off the allergens is also contributing to a rising number of sufferers. Dr Emberlin said another contributing factor is that the average hayfever season is becoming longer, typically stretching from April to the end of August. She added: 'There is substantial evidence from pollen monitoring records and from vegetation surveys to show that the timing of some of the pollen seasons has been changing in the UK and across Europe over the last few decades. Hayfever seasons in the UK are becoming longer, as warmer weather in spring and autumn means pollen is typically rife from March to the end of August . 'In addition there has been a trend to longer pollen seasons and increasing pollen loads of some types. 'Globally, average surface temperatures have increased by about 0.7°C over the past 100 years, leading to earlier plant growth in many regions. 'The trend towards warming has been more pronounced in winter months, resulting in more changes in the timing of spring pollen seasons than those of summer and autumn.' Hayfever is an allergic reaction to pollen and spores. It happens when the immune system mistakes these harmless airborne particles to be a danger and launches a defence against them. The body produces an antibody and histamine is released which causes the typical symptoms of sneezing, runny nose and eyes, an itching nose and mouth, and possibly a blocked nose. The allergy is a seasonal one, triggered by a range of different pollens ranging from tree to grass, weeds to fungal spores. By 2030, Dr Emberlin predicts there will be 31.8 million sufferers as the situation will worsen. 'As summers become warmer more photochemical smogs will occur on dry days resulting in an increased frequency of days with high concentrations of ozone, NOx and other pollutants that will make symptoms worse, and that will make people more susceptible to allergens,' she said. 'Due to climate change in the future, plant growth may be influenced in a way that more, new and altered pollens are produced, which may affect humans.' Dr Emberlin, speaking on behalf of Opticrom Hayfever Eye Drops, warned the season is expected to start suddenly with pollen counts surging from almost nothing to very high in a matter of days. Friday is set to be the hottest day of the year so far, with the mercury poised to rise steadily to reach 21°C in parts of southern England. In preparation, hayfever sufferers are being encouraged to take action, stocking up on antihistamines and other treatments to lessen the impact of their symptoms. 'It is very important to know the seasons, when it is likely to peak and the days when pollen levels will be particularly high. 'Knowing when the season is about to start means there is lots a person can do. 'If you are not sure of the best treatment you can speak to your pharmacist or GP. 'Steroids are often used to treat hayfever, but they are best taken before the onset of symptoms. Dr Jean Emberlin said: High and very high pollen (pictured under the microscope) counts can trigger hayfever symptoms in people who have not had them before' 'Antihistamines are also commonly used and it is a good idea to get them in and ready to use when the season starts. 'If you have got a big event, like exams or a wedding coming up you can ask your GP to prescribe a short course of steroid tablets to keep symptoms at bay. 'There are lots of options available, the key is just to be organised and ensure you are prepared. 'On days you know the pollen count is high make sure you take antihistamines before you leave the house, and wear sunglasses to keep pollen out of your eyes. 'Make sure you wash your clothes regularly and don't sleep with the window open.' Dr Emberlin said pollen counts can suddenly surge if conditions are right. 'A warm day with a slight breeze can signal the perfect conditions for spores to infest the air, causing pollen levels to surge,' she warned."

"BBC Northern Ireland is planning to move from its premises at Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue.
The corporation has yet to decide on a site.
The council has set out its preferred options for the broadcaster in its regeneration and investment strategy.
It said lands to the rear of Belfast Central Library, a site north of Great Patrick Street or the stalled Royal Exchange development could all be suitable.
It has recommended that a working group involving the BBC, the council, the universities and other agencies should be formed.
The Ulster University is currently building a major extension to its Belfast campus on the northern edge of the city centre.
Adjacent streets are also due to be redeveloped as part of the Northside scheme.
The council strategy expresses hope that a major department store, such as John Lewis, will anchor the Royal Exchange development.
But it states that if the retail option is not possible the BBC ""would be an obvious candidate"" as an anchor tenant.
The BBC has previously been linked with a move to Titanic Quarter or as part of the redevelopment of Great Victoria Street station.
The council's strategy also contains details of its Â£19m city centre investment fund.
It could be used to make loan or equity funding to developments or for the council to buy development sites."
"Fans got the happy ending they had been waiting for as the title character, created by Miranda Hart, got married.
The New Year's Day episode had 7.3m viewers, according to overnight figures.
The first part of the finale, shown on Christmas Day, had 6.7m viewers overnight.
Writing in The Independent, Neela Debnath said Miranda had drawn to a close ""with a sweet and heart-warming ending"".
""It's surprisingly touching and quite tender - that's not to say there aren't any pratfalls - but the finale is about Miranda standing up to her mother and accepting herself as she is.""
Gerard O'Donovan, writing for The Telegraph, said: ""New Year's Day brought all the humour and joy we could have wanted in a masterclass of romantic comedy writing and performance that teased and toyed, then delivered big on the happy ending, with a wedding.""
Mark Lawson, writing in The Guardian, said: ""As admirers had hoped, Miranda ended up on the floor twice in her comedy send-offs.
""But her expanding career, of which her inventive and well-acted sitcom is only a small part, suggests that her detractors are unlikely to get their wish of her falling metaphorically flat on her face.""
Before the final show aired, Hart tweeted: ""Happy New Year Day and goodbye to my creative baby day. 8pm BBC One. Can't promise but you MIGHT get a glimpse of that @GaryBarlow.""
The show, which was first shown on BBC Two in 2009 before moving to BBC One, follows the trials and tribulations of Hart's character, a shop owner prone to committing social faux pas.
The programme also sees Patricia Hodge as her TV alter-ego's mother and Sarah Hadland as her shop's assistant manager.
The show, and its star, has won accolades from the Royal Television Society and the British Comedy Awards, among others.
The first episode of the third series was the most-watched television programme at Christmas in 2012.
The 41-year-old actress and comedienne is to star alongside Jude Law and Melissa McCarthy in American comedy Spy.
The film, directed by Bridesmaids' Paul Feig, is due to be released in UK cinemas in May.
An autobiographical book about Hart's life with her dog Peggy, Peggy And Me, will be also released this year."

"The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) suspended Russia from the Rio Games starting on 7 September because of state-sponsored doping.
Putin said the ruling was ""cynical"" and ""humiliates those who take such decisions"".
Only Russian track and field athletes were banned from the Olympics.
Putin, speaking at an award ceremony for Russian Olympians at the Kremlin, said the country would hold special competitions for banned Paralympic athletes, with the winners awarded the same prizes as in Rio.
Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Russian Paralympians had taken ""collective responsibility for an unproven crime""."
"It happened at a 21st birthday party in the apartment in Berkeley, California.
Five of the victims were from Ireland, and some of them were students at University College Dublin (UCD).
UCD President Andrew Deeks expressed condolences to their families saying ""we are heartbroken at their suffering and loss"".
Those who were killed have been named as:
Several others have been injured, some of them very seriously.
Ms Donohoe, who had dual US-Irish citizenship, lived in California while the other five who died all had home addresses in Ireland.
Mr Culligan and Mr Schuster were both past-pupils of St Mary's College in Rathmines, Dublin.
The majority of the victims were in the US on work visas, on the J1 USA summer work and travel programme.
The families of some of the students who died have arrived in the United States from Ireland.
In a statement, the UCD president said: ""It is with deepest sadness that I speak of the tragic accident involving UCD students and their friends in San Francisco.
""On behalf of the entire university community, I wish to extend our condolences to the families and friends of those who died and to those who were injured.
""We cannot comprehend the desperate shock and grief they are feeling and we are heartbroken at their suffering and loss.""
UCD is opening an online Book of Condolence on its website and is offering its counselling and student support services to the bereaved in the US and Dublin.
""Our students, like thousands of others across Ireland, head to the US each summer on J1 visas to enjoy the experience,"" Mr Deeks said.
""It is heart-breaking to imagine that such a tragedy would strike these wonderful students when their lives are opening up to discover the world.""
In a statement on Tuesday night, St Mary's College paid tribute to its past pupils.
""The thoughts and prayers of everybody in the St Mary's community are with the families of Niccolai and Eoghan, as well as the other Irish youngsters named by the US authorities this evening,"" the school statement said.
""We also pray particularly for those injured, and their families.""
Ireland's Consul General in San Francisco Philip Grant said it had been a very traumatic time for everyone involved.
""To have this happen at the start of this season is something that has left us all frozen in shock and disbelief,"" he said.
""It touches every single family in Ireland.""
Mr Grant will lay a wreath at a ceremony near the site of the balcony collapse later.
Fr Aidan McAleenan from St Columba's Church in Oakland near Berkeley, and who is originally from Banbridge, County Down, spent several hours with the injured and their friends.
""It was very emotional driving out and getting to the hospital and then having to tell some of them that another friend had died,"" he told the BBC.
""It was really hard to know what to say or what to do. We prayed with them.  Other people from the Irish community arrived. They are really devastated. That sense you have when you are totally shocked.""
Fr McAleenan and members of the Irish Pastoral Centre will be working closely with the families of the victims, and there will be a special Mass on Thursday.
The national flag with be flown at half-mast at Irish Government Buildings as a mark of respect for those who died.

"From moisturising skin to beating bacterial infections, coconut oil was the health food du jour in 2014. But there's a new superfood on the block, which is thought to enhance your mood, renew skin and even help with menopause symptoms. Reaping with beauty and health benefits, experts say it's time to replace coconut oil with pumpkin seed oil, which is being touted as the the new must-have - and, of course, health aficionado Gwyneth Paltrow is already a fan. Health gurus are touting pumpkin seed oil as the next big thing - and say it can help enhance your mood, renew skin and even reduce menopause symptoms (just ask Gwyneth Paltrow, who features it in many of her recipes in her book, It's All Good) Much like coconut oil, pumpkin seed oil is thought to help boost shiny locks. Pumpkin seeds are rich in vitamins A, K and E, as well as vital minerals and fatty acids, which can help strengthen hair and even help boost hair growth. When applied to the lengths of your locks, PowerHealth, who supply the health produce, say it  hydrates hair follicles giving shiny and lustrous strands. It also apparently has similar skin-boosting benefits. With high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids and natural antioxidants, pumpkin seed oil helps promote normal cell structure and retains moisture, which ensures skin is hydrated and youthful. Zinc and vitamin E from the pumpkin seed can also improve the skin’s healing process, helping to fight off acne, beat scarring and maintain skin renewal. Pumpkin seeds, left, are rich in vitamins A, K and E, as well as vital minerals and fatty acids, which can help, strengthen hair. The oil, right, can be drizzled onto food or applied directly to skin and hair to help boost your beauty and health . Studies have even found that pumpkin seeds are a mood-boosting food. Pumpkin seeds and chia seeds topped a top-ten list of mood-boosting foods compiled by dietitian Sarah Schenker and food psychologist Christy Fergusson. One of the richest sources of tryptophan, pumpkin seeds increase production of serotonin, a hormone that can help improve people’s mood and help us feel relaxed. With a high zinc content, which plays a central role in boosting the immune system and cell division, pumpkin seeds can increase brain power by enhancing memory and focus, claim nutritionists. The potent seeds are also thought to help beat menopausal symptoms. The little seeds are said to be rich in natural phytoestrogens, which can decrease blood pressure, headaches, hot flushes, joint pain and other menopausal symptoms. Pumpkin seeds, pictured, topped a top-ten list of mood-boosting foods compiled by dietitian Sarah Schenker and food psychologist Christy Fergusson . Nutritional therapist Angela Falaschi told The Telegraph: 'Hot ﬂushes are one of the most common and distressing symptoms of the menopause, with extreme highs and lows in temperature causing episodes of profuse sweating. 'I often recommend supplementing the diet with isoﬂavonoids (naturally occurring compounds) by incorporating chick peas, soya, lentils and pumpkin seeds into your meals.' Gwyneth Paltrow, who penned cookbook It's All Good, loves to use the nutrient-rich seeds in her healthy recipes. Lorna Driver-Davies, Nutritionist at NutriCentre, said: 'Pumpkin seed oil is high in the polyunsaturated fatty acid (a longer chain fatty acid) omega 6, which is beneficial for the skin and hormone support in women. I also recommend pumpkin seed oil to men due to the zinc content. 'But we must be careful to not use too much omega 6 oils in our diet as we need less of them than we do omega 3. A source of omega 3 would be oily fish. When using any nutritional oils, we should all be aware that balance is key and use a wide variety of sources; coconut, pumpkin and fish, for example.'"
"Carnival had said in March that the sinking of its Costa Concordia cruises ship in January could wipe out profits this year as people shunned cruises.
However, on Tuesday the firm reported that profits were $1.33bn (Â£819m) in the third quarter, compared with $1.34bn in the same period last year.
Shares in the firm in New York rose more than 3%.
Thirty-two people died in the shipwreck in January, which an official report blamed the captain of the Costa Concordia for causing, as well as assigning some responsibility to Costa, which is owned by Carnival.
The Costa Concordia still lies next to the rocky outcrops off Giglio Island in Italy's Tuscan coast.
Carnival said it had managed to generate more money from its cruise passengers.
""The significant efforts of our brand management teams were successful in partially mitigating the decline in cruise ticket prices,"" said chairman and chief executive Micky Arison.
The company also plans to focus on emerging markets.
""For 2013, the company will capitalise on the increasing popularity of cruising in Asia with the deployment of a second Costa ship in China and the launch of a new Princess Cruises program for the Japanese market,"" it said.
Costa Cruises is a subsidiary of Carnival and runs some of the company's total fleet of 100 ships. Other brands include Carnival, P&O, Cunard, Holland America, Princess and Seabourn."
"Ed Snowden, a 29-year-old former technical worker for the CIA, has since revealed himself to be the source of the leaks in an interview with the Guardian news website.
US director of national intelligence James Clapper described the leaks as ""extremely damaging"" to national security, but Mr Snowden said he had acted because he found the extent of US surveillance ""horrifying"".
What could the US government see?
According to the documents revealed by Ed Snowden, the US National Security Agency (NSA) has access on a massive scale to individual chat logs, stored data, voice traffic, file transfers and social networking data of individuals.
The US government confirmed it did request millions of phone records from US company Verizon, which included call duration, location and the phone numbers of both parties on individual calls.
How much do the spooks know?
Why every call matters
What can you learn from phone records?
According to the documents, Prism also enabled ""backdoor"" access to the servers of nine major technology companies including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple.
These servers would process and store a vast amount of information, including private posts on social media, web chats and internet searches.
All the companies named have denied their involvement, and it is unknown how Prism actually works.
National Security Agency (NSA) Director Keith Alexander said that the eavesdropping operations have helped keep Americans secure - yet cannot provide details. ""If we tell the terrorists every way that we're going to track them, they will get through and Americans will die,"" he said
Some experts question its true powers, with digital forensics professor Peter Sommer telling the BBC the access may be more akin to a ""catflap"" than a ""backdoor"".
""The spooks may be allowed to use these firms' servers but only in respect of a named target,"" he said.
""Or they may get a court order and the firm will provide them with material on a hard-drive or similar.""
What about data-protection laws?
Different countries have different laws regarding data protection, but these tend to aim to regulate what data companies can hold about their customers, what they can do with it and how long they can keep it for - rather than government activity.
Most individual company privacy policies will include a clause suggesting they will share information if legally obliged - and include careful wording about other monitoring.
Facebook's privacy policy, for example, states: "" We use the information [uploaded by users] to prevent potentially illegal activities"".
Are we all being watched?
The ways in which individual governments monitor citizen activity is notoriously secretive in the interests of national security, and officials generally argue that preventing terrorism over-rides protecting privacy.
""You can't have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,"" said US President Barack Obama, defending US surveillance tactics.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that phone records were only accessed by the NSA in cases where there was reason to suspect an individual was connected with al-Qaeda or Iran.
Speaking to the BBC UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said that ""law abiding citizens"" in Britain would ""never be aware of all the things... agencies are doing to stop your identity being stolen or to stop a terrorist blowing you up"".
Does it make a difference which country you live in?
User data (such as emails and social media activity) is often not stored in the same country as the users themselves - Facebook for example has a clause in its privacy policy saying that all users must consent to their data being ""transferred to and stored in"" the US.
The US Patriot Act of 2001 gave American authorities new powers over European data stored in this way.
This method of storage is part of cloud computing, in which both storage and processing is carried out away from the individual's own PC.
""Most cloud providers, and certainly the market leaders, fall within the US jurisdiction either because they are US companies or conduct systematic business in the US,"" Axel Arnbak, a researcher at the University of Amsterdam's Institute for Information Law, told CBS News last year after conducting a study into cloud computing, higher education and the act.
""In particular, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments (FISA) Act makes it easy for US authorities to circumvent local government institutions and mandate direct and easy access to cloud data belonging to non-Americans living outside the US, with little or no transparency obligations for such practices - not even the number of actual requests.""
Are other governments involved?
UK Foreign Secretary William Hague has so far refused to confirm or deny whether British government surveillance department GCHQ has had access to Prism.
It is not known whether other governments around the world have been either aware of or involved in the use of Prism, which is reported to have been established in 2007.
In a statement, the EU Justice Commission said it was ""concerned"" about the consequences of Prism for EU citizens and was ""seeking more details"" from the US authorities.
""Where the rights of an EU citizen in a Member State are concerned, it is for a national judge to determine whether data can be lawfully transmitted in accordance with legal requirements (be they national, EU or international),"" said a spokesperson for Justice Commissioner Vivane Reding.
What does this mean for internet use?
William Hague insists that law-abiding citizens have nothing to worry about, and there is no legal way of ""opting out"" of monitoring activity carried out in the name of national or global security.
However privacy concerns about information uploaded to the internet have been around for almost as long as the internet itself, and campaign group Privacy International says the reported existence of Prism confirms its ""worst fears and suspicions"".
""Since many of the world's leading technology companies are based in the US, essentially anyone who participates in our interconnected world and uses popular services like Google or Skype can have their privacy violated through the Prism programme,"" says  Privacy International on its website.
""The US government can have access to much of the world's data, by default, with no recourse.""
Edward Snowden, the source of the leaked documents, said he had acted over concerns about privacy.
""I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of thingsâ€¦ I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded,"" he told the Guardian."
"Reanne Evans saw her 10-year reign as women's world snooker champion surprisingly ended on Tuesday. The 29-year-old from Dudley earlier this month lost narrowly to Ken Doherty in the first round of qualifying for the Crucible-staged Betfred World Championship. She suffered a fresh blow at the Northern Snooker Centre in Leeds as she relinquished her WLBSA World Ladies title, losing 4-2 in the semi-finals to Hong Kong's Ng On Yee, who went on to defeat England's Emma Bonney 6-2 in the final. Reanne Evans has seen her reign as women's world snooker champion come to a shock end . Hong Kong's Ng On Yee poses with the women's title of the World Amateur Snooker Championship in 2009 . Hong Kong's Yee, the 2009 and 2010 World Amateur champion only dropped four frames in four maths from the last-16 stage onwards. But it is her win over Evans which really stands out. Evans has dominated the ladies' game and in 2010 became the first woman to be afforded the chance to qualify for men' events since 1994. And she had pushed Doherty close, only to lose 10-8 in the first of three qualifying rounds for this year's men's World Championship.

"A passenger waiting to board a plane in an airport terminal has been hospitalised with deep cuts on his leg and buttocks after he broke a toilet he was squatting on. Passenger Jin Pai, 35, was standing on the rim of a toilet in Hefei Xinqiao International Airport in the city of Hefei, the capital city of eastern China's Anhui Province, when it smashed to the ground. According to airport officials he had not wanted to let his bottom touch the seat because he was 'worried it might not be clean'. Passenger Jin Pai, 35, was standing on the rim of a toilet when it collapsed, leaving him hospitalised . The smashed up toilet in Hefei Xinqiao International Airport in the city of Hefei . But he was caught out when the porcelain toilet then tipped over and shattered on the floor, cutting the man in several places. The injured man was found bleeding on the toilet floor after he had telephoned his travelling companions for help. He had been too embarrassed to shout for help and had hoped they would assist but he was too badly hurt for anything other than an immediate trip to hospital. Authorities and emergency personnel arrived to check the man into a Hefei hospital, where he received several dozens stitches on his left leg and buttocks. Then man broke the toilet in Hefei Xinqiao International Airport in the city of Hefei . The passenger reportedly confessed to his friends that he was squatting on the toilet, but later changed his story to the police, possibly to avoid paying compensation, and said he was sitting when the poorly built toilet gave way. Authorities said they believed the incident was an accident. Police spokesman Bo Chiang said: 'In any case, we would like to remind people that these toilets are for sitting on, not for standing on.'"
"Daniel Sturridge's season of frustration looks set to continue as he faces a race to be fit to lead Liverpool’s attack at Wembley. The England striker failed to train again on Thursday as Brendan Rodgers stepped up preparations for Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final with Aston Villa, meaning Sturridge hasn’t been involved in any outdoor work since before the quarter-final replay against Blackburn. Liverpool still have two more sessions before they travel south but Sturridge, who missed Monday’s 2-0 win over Newcastle United with tightness in his hip, would have to involved in at least one to stand any chance of starting at Wembley. Daniel Sturridge faces a fight to be fit for Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa on Sunday . Striker Sturridge was left out of the squad against Newcastle on Monday after being taken off at Blackburn . It would even appear touch and go as whether Sturridge will be fit enough to make Rodgers’ 18-man squad, given how tormented he has been with fitness issues this season. Liverpool will give Sturridge every chance to prove his fitness but the signs at present are not encouraging. The injury is a continuation of the problem he sustained in the 2-1 defeat to Manchester United on March 22. Sturridge missed England’s games against Lithuania and Italy with what England manager Roy Hodgson called ‘a small tear’ in his hip. Sturridge admitted last week he will not be back at his sharpest until next season and he will be glad to see the back of this campaign, having missed more than five months with a combination of thigh and calf problems. Steven Gerrard could return at Wembley after seeing out the last game of his suspension against Newcastle . Liverpool captain Gerrard holds a '96' balloon at the Hillsborough memorial service on Wednesday . If, as appears likely, the 25-year-old is forced to play a minor role, it would leave Rodgers a decision to make with regards his starting line-up, as Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard is available having served a three-match suspension. Gerrard, whose 35th birthday falls on the same day as this year’s FA Cup final, missed several games in February and March with a hamstring problem but when he was fit for matches against Swansea and Manchester United, Rodgers decided to use him from the bench. He will be desperate to play at Wembley and Rodgers, who will be without cup-tied winger Jordon Ibe, must decide whether to keep faith with his current midfield of Lucas Leiva, Jordan Henderson and Joe Allen or alter his system to fit Gerrard back in. Rodgers will be without Jordon Ibe who is cup-tied having represented Derby in the FA Cup this season . Joe Allen says playing in these type of games is why he joined Liverpool from Swansea . Playing at Wembley will be a new experience for a number of Liverpool’s squad and Allen says a positive result against Villa is required to enhance their development. Liverpool are favourites to reach the final but the Wales international maintains there is no complacency in the group. ‘It’s the reason you join a club like this — the dream of competing for the top prizes and potentially getting some silverware,’ said Allen. ‘There’s a huge incentive for every player here. Villa had a great result on the weekend so they will be raring to go just like we will be. ‘That will make for a great game at a historic venue. Every single player wants to ensure we get ourselves back there for the final. Everyone is ready to make that leap. We are generally a young squad who are gathering experience and getting better all the time.’"
"Concerns for her welfare were raised by Paul Netherton, assistant chief constable at Devon and Cornwall Police.
He spoke out on Twitter on behalf of the girl, who had been held in a cell since Thursday because, he said, no beds were available anywhere in the UK.
NHS England said the 16-year-old would be moved on Saturday night.
A spokesman said: ""After details were provided to NHS England about the girl and her condition, a place was found locally within a few hours.
""We are grateful for the help of the NHS in the area in identifying the place.
""It is worth noting that mental health crisis services have been expanding so that the number of people ending up in police cells is in fact down - but clearly more needs to be done.""
Earlier on Twitter, Mr Netherton had described the situation as ""unacceptable"".
He tweeted: ""We have a 16yr old girl suffering from mental health issues held in police custody. There are no beds available in the uk!
""The 16yr old was detained on Thursday night, sectioned Friday lunchtime and still no place of safety available. This can't be right!
""Custody on a Fri & Sat night is no place for a child suffering mental health issues. Nurses being sourced to look after her in custody !?!""
He later  tweeted: ""Just heard that a place of care has been found for our 16yr old. Good result.""
Mr Netherton told BBC News the girl had been arrested at Torbay Hospital on Thursday after a breach of the peace and sectioned under the Mental Health Act on Friday because she was ""obviously very unwell"".
""We shouldn't have children, a schoolgirl, staying overnight in a custody block,"" he said.
According to the officer, 750 mental health patients had been placed in police cells across Devon and Cornwall so far this year.
Shadow health minister Luciana Berger described the teenager's predicament as ""an appalling reflection of the crisis in mental health services"".
""People shouldn't face the indignity of being kept in police cells when they are at their most vulnerable,"" she said.
Mark Winstanley, chief executive of mental health charity Rethink, said: ""Each year thousands of people with serious mental health problems are being held in police cells, including many children and teenagers, because the right services either don't exist in their community or are completely overstretched.
""Many people are being turned away from places of safety, because of staff shortages or lack of spaces.
""In some parts of the country, there are no health-based places of safety full-stop.
""As a result, people end up being held in police stations, or are simply left to fend for themselves. This has to change, as it's costing lives.
""Someone going through a physical health emergency would never be treated this way, so why should it be acceptable for people experiencing a mental health crisis?"""
"Bianca Nikol Roberson, a recent school graduate, was driving near West Goshen when her car veered off the road.
Police responded to what they initially thought was a fatal collision, but then discovered that Ms Roberson had been shot in the head.
Investigators believe another driver shot her as she attempted to merge into the same lane as a red pickup truck.
The road on which Ms Roberson was driving narrows to a single lane where it joins another main route.
""Her car started jostling with a red pickup truck - not actually hitting - but both of them trying to merge together,"" prosecutor Tom Hogan told reporters.
""And then she was shot. The man in the red pickup truck shot her directly in the head.""
""This was a senseless and brutal act of violence,"" he added.
Ms Roberson was pronounced dead at the scene. The case is now being treated as a homicide.
Police have issued a call for help in tracing the pickup truck and the suspect, who is described as a white male aged between 30 and 40 with blonde hair and a medium build.
Mr Hogan said ""every cop in three states"" is looking for the vehicle.
Ms Roberson's father, Rodney, spoke to NBC News about his daughter, telling them she was preparing to attend university.
""We were all excited for her,"" he told the station. ""She was excited. We were just happy for her.""
Her brother, Dontae Arburg, said she was ""very loved.""
""She always smiled. Always wanted to entertain and make you smile,"" he said."
"Fresh fears were raised last night that Greece could exit the eurozone after it was claimed negotiations with its European creditors were ‘not working’. An official at the International Monetary Fund reportedly admitted that he cannot envisage a successful conclusion to the country’s bailout. Greece this week repeated threats to stop paying off its loan and default on its debt if Europe refuses to release more funds. Thomsen's prediction was made as the Greek government repeated previous threats that unless more bail out money was made available then it would stop paying back creditors . This would make it harder for the country to remain in the eurozone, although no state has ever left and there is no official exit process. Poul Thomsen, the IMF's Europe Director has been quoted by the Greek media as saying he could not see a successful conclusion to the country's current bail out. The fund's Europe chief reportedly told his executive board that negotiations were not going as hoped, the Daily Telegraph reported. Thomsen's prediction was made as the Greek government repeated previous threats that unless more bail out money was made available then it would stop paying back creditors. One Greek official has been quoted by the Financial Times as saying that if the European Central Bank did not play ball with the Mediterranean Eurozone member there could be no alternative to a default. Mr. Thomsen also issued a warning over Greece's recent, weak economic performance. He met with Greece's finance minister Yanis Varoufakis earlier this month. Greece repaid a roughly €450 million loan instalment to the International Monetary last week but Athens' financial problems, as outlined by Mr. Thomsen, have renewed fears the country might miss the IMF payment of €200m payment on the 1st May and another for €745m 11 days later. This could lead to he EU member being forced, eventually, to leave the eurozone. The IMF debt stems from Greece's international bailout, under which the country was extended €240 billion in rescue loans from other eurozone countries and the IMF to prevent bankruptcy. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis (left) met with Mr. Thomsen who expressed worry over the Greek economy. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' (right) government has been talking with creditors since January . Varoufakis has said that Greece is committed to making its repayments and accepts the fiscal restrictions imposed on the country but within reason. He said at a conference last week that Greece was 'not going to sign on the dotted line of anything you give us just to get the next loan tranche', 'At the very same time,' he added, 'we need to have a fiscal plan that makes sense. At the moment Greece is committed.' However,Greece's new left wing-led government which has been locked in strained negotiations with creditors since winning elections in January continues to hold its recent election victory over the international community. Varoufakis has said that Greece is committed to making its repayments and accepts the fiscal restrictions imposed on the country but within reason . Greece's defence minister Panos Kammenos, whose right-wing Independent Greeks party props up the country's socialist government, said they had a mandate to rule. 'Even if elections take place, we will double our share of the vote,' he told Greek TV. Greece has been given until 20 April to clean up its finances and set in place a number of economic reforms, necessary if it is to receive further rescue money. There is seemingly a great deal to be done if the country is to meet creditors' expectations. The IMF will meet in Washington this week and Yanis Varoufakis is due to meet President Obama on Thursday. Greece has been given until 20 April to clean up its finances and set in place a number of economic reforms, necessary if it is to receive further rescue money ."

"As an EU member, the UK and UK-based firms can sell their goods to EU customers without having to pay additional taxes. Likewise, British firms and consumers can import from the EU tariff-free.
The prime minister has already ruled out continued membership of the EU's single market post-Brexit, with many assuming this means the UK will also leave the customs union.
Essentially there are two options:
The WTO is an international agency with 164 member countries and its purpose is to promote international commerce. All the leading world economies are members of the WTO, including the UK. European Union countries are also all members, but they act together in the WTO as the EU.
One of the most important principles of the WTO is that you should not discriminate between other WTO members. The UK and the EU would both have to impose on one another's exports the same barriers they apply to goods from the other WTO member countries.  In fact, in the absence of a free trade agreement they would be obliged under WTO rules to do that.
They include import tariffs, which are taxes applied only to imports. WTO members make commitments that they will not raise tariffs above a certain level. Those maximum levels, known as bound levels or bindings, vary from country to country and product to product. The tariffs they actually apply can be, and in many cases are, below those levels. But if you do go below bound levels, you have to do it for imports from all WTO members.
For the EU the average maximum tariff is 4.8% for all goods. But there are some big variations.  It's generally higher for agricultural produce, 10.9% on average. For most industrial goods it's quite low, but for cars, the tariff is 10%.
Assuming the UK were trading with the EU under WTO terms, the figures are an indication of the levels of tariffs British exporters would face on their goods. It would make them less competitive in the EU market than they currently are with no tariffs at all.
The UK's new schedule will have to have the consent of the other WTO members. It is administratively easier and less likely to be contested if we stick with the arrangement that we already have, as the UK's ambassador to the WTO, Julian Braithwaite. wrote in his blog: ""So to minimise any grounds for objection, we plan to replicate our existing trade regime as far as possible in our new schedules.""
However, the UK would be free to apply lower tariffs. In some cases it is highly likely we would. For example, the EU imposes seasonal tariffs on orange imports when the Mediterranean producers have their harvest. Getting rid of that is an example of what one former trade official described to me as ""low hanging fruit"".
Some economists, including Patrick Minford of Cardiff University and one of the leading members of Economists for Brexit (now renamed as Economists for Free Trade), favour a more comprehensive exercise in cutting tariffs and other barriers unilaterally. But these cuts would have to apply to goods coming from the EU as well.
Don't be fooled, some aspects will be more complicated. For some farm produce, for example, the EU has quotas that can be imported at lower tariffs (called tariff rate quotas). We don't yet know how these will be divided between the UK and the remainder of the EU.
There is also the question of what happens to that produce when it is traded between the UK and the EU. Currently it is tariff-free. Both will probably want a slice of the other's reduced tariff quota. That will mean either a bigger total quota or a reduced slice for some other country.
In the WTO, the EU has agreed to a cap on some of its farm subsidies. We don't currently know what type of system the UK will adopt and potentially this an area of difficulty. The EU however is well below its subsidy cap, and that could make this area less contentious than it might have been.
No. There are many other types of trade restrictions. These include rules on product specifications, labelling, testing, and requirements for authorisation from a national regulator to provide some types of services. The UK would have to decide whether or not to maintain EU rules in these areas.
Currently a trade dispute would be a matter for the European Court of Justice. Theresa May has already said that its jurisdiction in the UK will end. If there is a trade agreement with the EU it would probably contain some arrangement for a tribunal to make rulings.
If there is no such deal then any dispute would have to go to the WTO's dispute settlement system, which can establish panels to make rulings.
Whatever happens, the UK and the EU will be subject to WTO rules. It is just that the membership of the EU and any new trade agreement that might be negotiated allows for deeper integration than is involved in simply complying with the WTO's rulebook."
"The actor said he was ""thrilled"" to be asked to portray Tommy Butler in The Great Train Robbery: A Copper's Tale.
The drama will follow A Robber's Tale, which will view the heist from the perspective of its perpetrators.
Luke Evans will star in that film as Bruce Reynolds, the raid's key planner.
Broadbent said it would be ""great fun"" to play Butler, ""a fascinating copper of the old school"", in the drama, to air later this year.
""I have such strong memories of the massive impact of the actual robbery and it is wonderful to find out from the script so much of the real story.""
Chris Chibnall, executive producer and writer of the Great Train Robbery dramas, said Broadbent was ""a dream piece of casting"".
The actor won an Oscar in 2001 for playing the husband of writer Iris Murdoch in Iris and a Bafta in 2007 for playing the campaigner Lord Longford.
Butler, whose astuteness earned him the nickname ""Grey Fox"", led the investigation into the Great Train Robbery which resulted in several of the robbers receiving lengthy sentences.
He retired in 1969 and died the following year at the age of 57."

The Toffees will pay about £5m compensation for the 53-year-old Dutchman, who leaves Saints after two years in charge.
Everton have been without a manager since they sacked Roberto Martinez just before the end of the 2015-16 season.
It is expected Koeman's appointment will be confirmed by Friday.
Listen: Saints fans feeling let down by Koeman
BBC Radio 5 live's Football Daily podcast
Koeman, who has been headhunted by new Everton owner Farhad Moshiri, will sign a deal reported to be worth about £6m a year.
The former Netherlands international, who is on holiday, will take brother Erwin and fitness coach Jan Kluitenberg with him to Goodison Park.
Saints have finished seventh and sixth under Koeman - their best Premier League campaigns.
Martinez promised Champions League qualification when appointed but Everton finished 11th in 2015-16, his third year at the club.
In April, Saints chairman Ralph Krueger said discussions with Koeman over a new deal were progressing ""in a very good direction"", but added the club was ""not in any real hurry"".
And last month the former Ajax, PSV Eindhoven and Barcelona defender said he expected to stay with the Saints for the final year of his contract.
Koeman made more than 763 appearances as a player, scoring 253 goals, and won the 1988 European Championship with the Netherlands.
He won the European Cup - now the Champions League - with PSV Eindhoven in 1988 and Barcelona in 1992, scoring the winner for the latter against Sampdoria at Wembley.
He also won four domestic league titles apiece in the Netherlands and Spain.
Koeman has since managed Vitesse Arnhem, Ajax, Benfica, PSV, Valencia, AZ Alkmaar, Feyenoord and Southampton.
He has won the Dutch league with both Ajax and PSV.
Reaction
Former Southampton and England forward Matt le Tissier said he was ""disappointed"" and ""quite surprised"" at Koeman's decision to leave, particularly with Saints playing in the Europa League next season.
""He may feel he has got a better chance of winning trophies at Everton. I'd be of a slightly different opinion,"" Le Tissier told BBC Sport. ""I understand they've got a new owner and want to splash a bit of cash, but it might not be as easy a job as he thinks.
""Most clubs in the Premier League are pretty wealthy now and can compete in the transfer market. We just have to move on and look to the next man to take us forward again.
""The players' loyalty lies with the football club and hopefully they will kick us on again next season."""
"Spencer Wilding, who hails from Rhyl, was the guest of honour at a special screening of Rogue One.
He had to muster all powers of the force to keep his Vader role secret until the film's release.
""It's a hell of a secret to keep,"" said Wilding, who was cast as the body actor for the role.
""But when you're a professional actor - when you sign that black and white sheet of paper saying you cannot say a word... I'm true to my word and I didn't say anything.""
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme, the 44-year-old said it proved a tricky task after rumours of the role leaked a year ago.
""I've been having hundreds of people every day for a year asking me if I'm Vader,"" he said.
""If I had a pound for everyone who asked I'd be buying myself a new Death Star - and it'd be gold plated.""
The 6ft 7in (2m) tall actor already has a string of Hollywood appearances to his name, including Guardians of the Galaxy, Green Lantern, three Harry Potter films and the TV blockbuster Game of Thrones.
He said the Vader role came from a regular casting call, first with a self-filmed tape, then a recall to Pinewood Studios.
""It's very, very secretive. We didn't even know exactly what the character was and what film it was until we got there,"" he said.
""I opened up the curtain when I went in the dressing room and there he was - Vader.
""Anybody out there who got into that costume and got an audition to be Darth Vader alone is very exciting, so to pull the character off as well, it's like 'What!'
""I'm always pinching myself - I am definitely awake - it is not a dream, it is just another dream come true.""
While the actor has the body role, just like his predecessor in the original Star Wars films David Prowse, the voice of Lord Vader is actor James Earl Jones.
That did not stop Wilding trying out the voice during filming.
""I'm not James Earl Jones - nowhere near him - but you know I got close to him I think, which helped the other actors - you know, you've got Vader in front of you."""
"The law, which is set to become a world first, aims to close the wage gap between men and women.
Companies face auditing and possible fines if they do not comply.
Iceland was ranked first in the World Economic Forum's 2015 Global Gender Gap Index, followed by Norway, Finland and Sweden.
However, according to Iceland's statistics for the same year, the unadjusted gender pay gap remained at 17%.
The bill, which was presented on Tuesday, is supported by the centre-right coalition government and the opposition.
Applying to both the public and private sector, it would prohibit any discrimination not just on gender, but also on race, religion, disability, occupational disability, age and sexual orientation grounds.
""The bill entails that companies and institutions of a certain size, 25 or more employees, undertake a certification of their equal-pay programmes,"" Thorsteinn Viglundsson, the minister of social affairs and equality, told news agency AFP.
The bill will now be subject to a series of debates, and if it passes, it will take effect from January 2018.
In Iceland's parliament, nearly 50% of lawmakers are women, and a voluntary measure for equal pay across the country was introduced in 2012.
However, many still do not think enough is being done.
In October, thousands of women left work early and headed out on to the streets of the capital, Reykjavik, to protest against earning less than men.
It echoed the 1975 Icelandic women's strike, when women did not go to their paid jobs, or do any housework or child-rearing at home for one day."
"Visitors are being offered hot drinks, pastries, calligraphy demonstrations and discussion during the ""open-house"" weekend.
The country's leading Muslim body, the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM), seeks to distance mainstream Islam from recent jihadist attacks.
The initiative comes a year after the Charlie Hebdo killings in Paris.
Jihadist gunmen killed 17 people at different Paris sites, including the offices of the satirical Charlie Hebdo magazine and a kosher supermarket.
Marking the anniversary of the killings, President Francois Hollande unveiled a plaque on Saturday in tribute to one of those who died, policewoman Clarissa Jean-Philippe.
France also remembered the four Jewish hostages killed at the supermarket.
France is still under a state of emergency after November's Paris attacks, carried out by gunmen linked to the Islamic State group, which killed 130 people.
Hundreds of French mosques are taking part in the open-house event, dubbed a ""brotherly cup of tea"".
""The objective is to create a space where people can be together and meet normal Muslim worshippers and all of our fellow citizens,"" CFCM President Anouar Kbibech told AFP.
He said the CFCM wanted to use the anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo attacks to ""highlight the real values of Islam, to set straight the cliches about links to violence and terrorism""."
"A hung parliament could send financial markets into a tailspin and the pound and shares crashing, experts warned last night. Sterling has already fallen nearly five per cent against the US dollar in the past five weeks amid jitters about the outcome of the general election. Experts said last night that a badly hung parliament, with neither major party able to form a stable government, would be likely to send to pound plummeting by a further ten per cent. Sterling has already fallen nearly five per cent against the US dollar in the past five weeks amid jitters about the outcome of the general election . The sell-off could accelerate and spread to the stock and bond markets – driving share prices down and borrowing costs up for the government, businesses and families, analysts warned. A Liberal Democrat analysis released as party leaders prepare for tonight’s seven-way TV debate showed that 98 per cent of polls conducted so far this year to a hung parliament. All the major pollsters are predicting that no party will win an overall majority, and all leading bookmakers now have the shortest odds on such an outcome. Last night, a forecast from pollster YouGov suggested the likely result on May 7 is a badly hung Parliament. It predicted the Conservatives would end up on 297 seats, only slightly down on 2010, Labour 262, the SNP 35, Liberal Democrats 30, losing almost half of their MPs, Ukip four and the Greens one. A second Conservative-Lib Dem coalition would only be able to command a Commons majority of four, making it difficult to form a stable government. Senior Conservatives are understood to have privately discussed the possibility of a three-way coalition, also involving Northern Ireland’s DUP, who currently have eight MPs, to increase the Government’s majority. George Buckley, UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said: ‘The 2015 UK general election is set to be the most unpredictable for nearly a century. There may be no good outcome for investors.’ The pound could fall by ten per cent against the US dollar between the Thursday of polling day and the following Monday if a stable government does not emerge, according to experts at currency firm Argentex. ‘Currencies react badly to political uncertainty,’ said Argentex managing director Harry Adams. ‘If polls continue to churn out mixed results in the lead up to D-day the pound will continue to soften. The real danger for sterling is if a coalition can’t be agreed by Monday.’ Pollster YouGov suggested the likely result on May 7 is a badly hung Parliament. It predicted the Conservatives would end up on 297 seats, only slightly down on 2010, Labour 262, the SNP 35, Liberal Democrats 30, losing almost half of their MPs, Ukip four and the Greens one . Veteran City commentator David Buik, an analyst at stock broker Panmure Gordon, said a hung parliament could be hugely damaging for the investors in stocks and shares such as those saving for a pension. ‘Markets are incapable of dealing with uncertainty,’ he said. He said the biggest fear in the City is a deal between Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats – an outcome that could send the stock market down by ten to 15 per cent ‘in a few weeks’. ‘The negative perception that this kind of government could have on markets could be visceral both at home and internationally,’ said Mr Buik. A hard-hitting report by BlackRock, the largest fund manager in the world, said yesterday that ‘a soothing outcome for the markets is hard to imagine’ given Labour’s anti-business policies and Tory plans to hold a referendum on Britain’ s membership of the European Union. ‘Labour would be tough on business – and might be perceived as lacking fiscal responsibility,’ the US giant said in the report. ‘A Conservatives-dominated Cabinet would pave the way for an unsettling referendum in 2017 on the UK’s EU membership. ‘Whoever wins – and the result could take some time to emerge – will lead a weak government likely to pass only watered-down legislation.’ BlackRock, which invests in major British companies such as Tesco, said weeks of horse-trading to form a government would be ‘harrowing for the UK’."
"Tons of rotting fish have filled a lagoon in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil where Olympic rowing and canoeing events will be held during next year's Games. Over the past week, thousands of the silver fish have died and have been scooped out of Rodrigo de Freitas lake, but city authorities and biologists have argued about the cause. More than 37 tons of fish have been collected, according to Rio's waste management company, but there is still an overwhelming stench, sparking complaints from neighbours and passers-by. Clearing: Rio's waste management company said it has cleared more than 37 tons of fish, which have been taken to the city's main dump . Olympics: Rodrigo de Freitas lake is set to host the Olympic rowing and canoeing events during next year's Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil . There is an overwhelming stench coming from the lake and authorities and biologists have argued about about the cause of the deaths . Rubbish collectors will continue to rake the decomposing fish, a small silvery species called twaite shad, off the water's surface until the the mass dying subsides. They are being taken to the city's main dump. The die-offs are common in Rio, where rivers, lakes and even the ocean are blighted by raw sewage and garbage. Rower and Olympic hopeful Felipe Xavier said: 'I have to come train but these dead fish bother us because the smell is very strong and the huge amount of fish slows the boat.' But Alexandre Fernandez, rowing coach of Botafogo club based in Rio, said he had no worries about the phenomenon and  believes the cause was natural, not because of pollution. In February, twaite shad died  in the blighted waters of Guanabara Bay, where the Olympic sailing events are to be held. Members of a local rowing club have to train among the dead fish in Rodrigo de Freitas lake ahead of the Olympic Games in the city in 2016 .

More than 37 tons of fish have been collected, according to Rio's waste management company, but there is still an overwhelming stench . The dead fish are being scooped out of the water by rubbish collectors using nets and are then taken to Rio de Janeiro's main dump . Rio's environmental secretariat has insisted that the latest incident is the result of a sudden change in water temperature. 'The intense rains that happened last week and a rise in the sea levels led to a spike in the (sea) water entering the lake, causing a thermal shock,' it said in a statement, reporting that water temperature in the lake quickly fell by 4C. However, several scientists have rejected that explanation, saying that pollution is really to blame. Estefan Monteiro da Fonseca, an oceanographer at Fluminense Federal University, said the official explanation 'makes no sense'. Despite more than 37 tons of the fish being removed from the water, there is still an overwhelming stench which has prompted complaints . Picturesque? Rio de Janeiro's stunning landscape has been blighted by the dead fish, which are currently being cleared from the water . Lagoon: There are so many fish on the surface of the lake in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil that almost no water can be seen in some places . Alexandre Fernandez (not pictured), rowing coach of Botafogo club, said he's not worried and believes the cause of the deaths was natural . He said: 'The lake continues receiving large quantities of sewage.' He added that it has large concentrations of sulfur because of the organic material dumped into it, and depending on the wind, that material rises to the surface and kills fish. Rio's water quality has become one of the most contentious issues heading into the 2016 Olympics.

"Villagers from Shandong Province in eastern China have reportedly resorted to transporting natural gas in plastic bags. Recent images show intrepid residents from Lijin village in Dongying city carry the explosive in bags as long as six metres on rickshaws, reported the People’s Daily Online. Worried passers-by compared this behaviour to carrying a bomb on their backs because any contact with a naked flame or even a cigarette could spell disaster. Gas-guzzler: Carrying natural gas in huge plastic bags is a common scene in some villages in Shandong . Penny-pinching: Local media suggest this is a way for villages to save money on the transportation of gas . This reckless behaviour has been reported on as early as May 2011 in Zibo city in Shandong. It has since spread to different parts of the province. Netizens and media suggest this is a way for the locals to save money on transportation. Some suggest they are actually stealing gas. An earlier undercover investigation by Anhui Satellite TV Station shows that villagers in Zibo have little understanding of the dangers, claiming it to be safe. Unaware of danger: Previous investigation discovered that residents had little understanding of the hazards . The news clip documented villagers and even school pupils stealing gas from a large roadside container. Their plastic bags were inflated within minutes, and they carried them off before someone else came along to do the same. Villagers told the undercover reporter transporting gas this way isn't dangerous at all. Questions are now being raised within China about why the authorities have taken no steps to ban this practise after all these years. Unprotected: The gas bags are sealed in a basic manner. Passers-by worry they could spell disaster any time ."
"A Chicago single mother has revealed what it's really like to live on McDonald's wages, where she makes only $10.50 an hour and can only afford to sleep in a moldy basement. Adriana Alvarez, 22, says that even with assistance from food stamps, Medicaid, and a child care subsidy, she is barely getting by, despite having worked for McDonald's for five years. Alvarez is a leader with Fight For $15, an international movement to raise minimum wage laws and acquire the right to unionize. She said her pay used to be even lower before she and fellow employees of the fast food chain began to protest. Scroll down for video . Single mother Adriana Alvarez, 22, has revealed what it's really like to live on McDonald's wages, where she makes only $10.50 an hour and can only afford to sleep in a moldy basement in Chicago . Alvarez (pictured with her three-year-old son Manny) says that even with assistance from food stamps, Medicaid, and a child care subsidy, she is barely getting by, despite having word for McDonald's for five years . The mother revealed in a column for Refinery29 that the first thing she would do with an increased wage would be to find a 'decent place to live' with good schools for her three-year-old son Manny. 'When it rains, water steeps into the apartment,' Alvarez writes of her basement home, the only place she said she can afford. 'This wetness brings mold, and I can't get rid of the smell. We can’t even leave anything on the floor... toys or anything else on the floor may get ruined when the water comes in.' Alvarez said that, after paying for 'child care, transportation to work, food, rent, and our other basic expenses,' she can never afford to give anything else to her son. 'Every time I think about taking Manny somewhere fun, like to a movie, I have to think about whether we can really afford the gas,' she writes. The mother said even providing the specific milk her son, who drinks 'a half-gallon every two days', requires because of his lactose intolerance can be a struggle. Since it's a more expensive brand, it uses up most of the $80 Alvarez is allotted in food stamps, she told the New York Times. Alvarez said her situation is not unique. She said that most of her co-workers are 'in the same boat', forced to rely on government assistance 'no matter how long they've held their jobs'. According to one study cited in Business Insider, half of the nation's fast food workers require some kind of government assistance, costing taxpayers $7billion a year. Alvarez is a leader with Fight For $15, an international movement to raise minimum wage laws and acquire the right to unionize. She said her pay used to be even lower before she and fellow employees began protesting . Last year more than 100 McDonald's employees, including Alvarez, who were part of Fight For $15 were arrested after they protested a McDonald's shareholder meeting to demand the $15 an hour wage . And $1.2billion of that public assistance goes to employees of McDonald's annually, reported a study released by the National Employment Law Project. Just weeks ago, McDonald's announced that it would be giving a $1 pay raise for about 90,000 employees, effectively making their wage $10 an hour. But the raise only applies to employees who work in restaurants owned by the corporation. Restaurants operated by independent franchise workers were ineligible for the wage bump, which Alvarez said disqualifies nine out of 10 McDonald's employees. And, even for those who do get an increased wage, Alvarez argues that the number would 'hardly going to lift any working family out of poverty'. And higher wages aren't all Alvarez and her co-workers are fighting for. She said Fight For $15 is also protesting for the ability to form a union 'without interference from management'. A group of protesters in New York stage a die-in as part of a day of rallies and protests by fast-food workers known as 'Fight for $15 on April 15' Fight For $15 (pictured protesting on Wednesday) started two years ago in New York, when hundreds of fast food workers went on strike the day after Thanksgiving . Alvarez writes that she needs a union to help negotiate sick days, which she said she is currently not provided with, costing her a day's worth of wages when she has to stay home if her son is ill. Fight For $15 started two years ago in New York City, when hundreds of fast food workers went on strike the day after Thanksgiving. The movement staged rallies across the country yesterday in honor of 'Fight for $15 on April 15'. Last year more than 100 McDonald's employees, including Alvarez, who were part of Fight For $15 were arrested after they protested a McDonald's shareholder meeting to demand a wage raise. There has been some change. Seattle and San Francisco have raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and a ballot campaign began in Washington, D.C. this week to initiate the same change. But Alvarez hope she will get to see change in her own life soon. 'It doesn't seem right that people who work with children or who serve food aren't paid enough to support their own kids or put food on their own table,' she writes. 'We want our families to be able to look forward to a better future.' There has been some change. Seattle and San Francisco have raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and a ballot campaign began in Washington, D.C. this week to initiate the same change ."
"A workman caught hanging out the door of a van travelling at 85mph down the motorway says he was only doing it because he needed some fresh air. The man, wearing an orange high-vis jacket, could be seen leaning out the sliding door of the black Vauxhall Vivaro van as it hurtled down the outside lane of the M40 near Oxford. He appeared to be laughing and making jokes with his colleagues inside the KJ Rail van as he hung his body - and even a leg - out of the vehicle. Today his boss, who has called the man in for a disciplinary hearing, revealed that the man claims he was only leaning out of the door because he wasn't feeling unwell and needed some fresh air. These shocking pictures show a workman hanging out of the door of a van as it speeds down the M40 . The man can be seen leaning out the side door of the black Vauxhall Vivaro van as it hurtled down the outside lane of the motorway . The incident, which police are investigating, is believed to have gone on for five minutes as the man pulled off the 'stunt' just yards from lorries. Dave Roy, a director at KJ Rail, said the man, the driver and their colleagues in the van would be hauled before a disciplinary hearing tomorrow morning. 'We're taking a robust approach to this and all of them will be in for a full disciplinary meeting first thing tomorrow,' he said. 'He's told me he was leaning out the door for some fresh air because he was feeling unwell and the next services were miles away. Having seen the pictures I'm not so sure. 'KJ Rail does not condone this sort of behaviour and takes a firm stance against it.' Mr Roy said the man could face the sack for the incident, which was captured by dentist James Hobkirk as he made his way down the M40, travelling south from Manchester to Kent. 'My wife was driving and she spotted something strange in the rear view mirror,' Mr Hobkirk, 37, said. He appeared to be laughing and making jokes with his colleagues inside the KJ Rail van as he hung his body - and even a leg - out of the vehicle . The incident, which police are investigating, went on for five minutes, as the man pulled off the 'stunt' just yards from lorries . 'I turned around and there was this guy in the outside lane hanging out of the van, saluting people as he went past. 'We were travelling about 65 in the middle lane and he came flying up behind us. He must have been doing about 80, 85. 'He was just hanging out the side door for about five minutes. He's obviously a complete nut job. 'People were moving in to the middle lane to get out of the way. It's like he was surfing. 'There were about four people in the back of the van and two in the front. They were all laughing. 'It's not just dangerous, he was an idiot. Going high speed in the outside lane and doing that is crazy.' KJ Rail, which owns the van, said it was investigating and that the man was likely to be punished . Thames Valley Police are also investigating the incident, which took place on Friday afternoon. A spokesman said: 'Thames Valley Police received a report of a man hanging out of a side door of a vehicle while travelling on the M40 motorway between junctions 9 and 8a southbound on Friday at 1.15pm. 'Officers attended the scene and carried out an area search however the vehicle was not located. Enquiries are ongoing to trace the occupants of the vehicle.' Philip Goose, senior community engagement officer at Brake, the road safety charity, said: 'Driving is the most dangerous thing we do on a daily basis. 'It is worth remembering that five people die every day on roads in the UK, and being in charge of a heavy, fast moving object has the potential to, and regularly does, kill and seriously injure individuals and tears apart families.

O'Neill and Keane agreed new deals with the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) in midweek although contracts have yet to be signed.
The duo's Irish side begin their Euro 2016 campaign against Sweden on Monday.
""We're happy to stay on. I really enjoy the job, working with the players, the staff and the FAI,"" said Keane, 44.
The former Manchester United star has made no secret of his desire to return to club management at some stage after previously managing Sunderland and Ipswich.
During his Republic of Ireland stint, which began in November 2013, Keane has twice been linked with the Celtic job but opted to remain as O'Neill's assistant on both occasions.
""With the club stuff, I'm 44 years of age so there is plenty of time for that,"" he said.
""I am keen to get back into it - and when I said short term, I mean in the next few years, not the next few weeks.""
In an otherwise good humoured news conference at the Republic's tournament base in Versailles, Keane's brow only furrowed when he was asked whether his contract includes a clause that will allow him to talk to clubs over the next two years.
""I think what's written in my contract is none of your business,"" the Corkman replied to the journalist.
""Who do you work with? What's your deal? Do they pay you good money? It's none of my business.""
A relaxed Keane even played along with the inevitable question about the Republic's tournament facilities, 14 years after he was infamously sent home from the county's pre-tournament training camp in Saipan on the eve of the 2002 World Cup.
""The FAI have done brilliantly. No doubt lessons have been learned. Trying to find something that was wrong, then maybe my bed's a bit too soft,"" joked the Republic assistant.
""The facilities are brilliant - they're a credit to everyone in the set-up here; the training pitch, the hotel, the location.
""It's great. It really is. We're enjoying it."""
"Over the next week, every BBC local radio station in England and the Channel Islands is accepting nominations for a local artist (or venue) that changed the course of musical history.
The winners will be honoured with a plaque on a building where they lived or a venue where they became famous.
To be considered the nominee must be:
The candidates will be submitted to The British Plaque Trust - and the 40 recipients will be unveiled on Friday, 9 June as part of BBC Music Day.
Surprisingly few pop musicians have one - with a notable exception being David Bowie, who is honoured at the location of the photoshoot for The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust in London's West End.
But who else deserves one? To get you thinking, here are five people and places that could benefit from a blue plaque.
Long before he could grow that designer stubble, George Michael met Andrew Ridgeley at Bushey Meads school and pop history changed forever.
Bonding over a love of music, the duo initially formed a five-piece band called The Replacements, who played everything from ska to Beethoven's Fur Elise.
Their friendship was vital in sustaining George through the whirlwind success of Wham! and eventually giving him the courage to go solo.
Estimated to be more than 100 million years old, Peak Cavern is undoubtedly the oldest music venue in the UK.
The natural limestone cavern has hosted gigs by the likes of Richard Hawley, Mystery Jets and The Vaccines, who all benefit from the site's remarkable acoustics.
Fun fact: It used to be called The Devil's Arse (because of the flatulent sound caused by flood water draining from the cave) but received a more demure name in 1880, so Queen Victoria wouldn't be offended when she visited for a concert.
While Queen were still a struggling young pop band, Freddie Mercury ran a stall in London's Kensington Market with drummer Roger Taylor.
They sold clothes and bric-a-brac, as well as a thesis Freddie had written about Jimi Hendrix while attending Ealing College.
The stall did well enough to fund the band in their early days -  so much so that they kept it going after Queen released their first album.
Delia Derbyshire is one of the earliest and most influential pioneers of electronic sound.
Working in a time before synthesisers, samplers and multi-track tape recorders, the musician, assisted by her engineer Dick Mills, created not only the original Dr Who theme but countless other experimental and ground-breaking recordings.
She was born in Coventry, but was evacuated to Preston, Lancashire, during World War Two. A blue plaque at either of her childhood homes would be a fitting memorial.
Not the most rock'n'roll of locations, Beachy Head nonetheless deserves its place in music history.
David Bowie filmed elements of the video for Ashes to Ashes there; and The Cure used it as the backdrop for both Just Like Heaven and Close To Me.
Industrial noise terrorists Throbbing Gristle used it in the deeply-ironic cover for their album, 20 Jazz Funk Greats; and, most famously of all, it stars in the final scene of The Who's Quadrophenia, where the young Jimmy throws his scooter over the edge of those chalky cliffs.
To make your suggestion for a musical blue plaque, you can contact your BBC local radio station via email, Twitter or Facebook; or email localmusiclegends@bbc.co.uk. You can also share suggestions on social media using #localmusiclegends.
The British Plaque Trust criteria is to commemorate innovative, influential and successful people who have died - but any genre of music is permissible, and significant locations which have played a part in our musical heritage are also eligible.
The initiative is not a vote - so the final decision on who or what the plaques commemorate, and where they are located, will not be based on the number of suggestions received.
Nominations close at midnight on Sunday, 26 February.

"Most brides spend months searching for the perfect accessories on their big day - but a knee-high cast and NHS-issue crutches aren't exactly on the list. However, Kimberley Donoghue, 28, from Ponthenri near Carmarthen, was forced to hobble down the aisle after breaking her leg and a bone in her foot just four days before her wedding. Wearing the heavy white cast beneath her fairy tale dress, her father wheeled her into church and she sat down to say her vows. Kimberley Donoghue, 28, from South Wales wore her leg in plaster under her dress, and has decided to postpone the official wedding photographs until the plaster is off . Ironically, the accident when she was preparing for the day. She said: 'I was carrying a box of wedding decorations down stairs when I suddenly fell. 'Once I got to the bottom of the stairs I knew straight away it was broken. 'Within an hour I was at the hospital and I was told I had a broken leg and I had fractured a bone in my foot. Kimberley says she'd spent a year planning her big day without any problems, until her leg hitch. 'I knew something had to go wrong,' she said. The 28-year-old was wheeled into church by her dad and had to sit to take her vows, after falling down stairs carrying decorations just four days before the wedding .

But Kimberley and new husband Calvin, 29, went ahead with tying the knot at their village church. She said: 'It was difficult getting down the aisle as I had quite a big dress and I had the crutches too. 'It was a hard day but it was brilliant. The florists were amazing and blinged up my crutches. 'I wouldn't change it for the world, well, maybe not the broken leg.' She says the family are planning another party in the summer to celebrate without her cast. They've also postponed the official wedding photographs until the plaster is off. Kimberley's aunt Sian Jones said: 'The day was fantastic. We were all so proud of her for being so brave and strong all day. 'It was very emotional when she came up the aisle.'"

"Guilty: Andras Janos Vass, 25, has been convicted of human trafficking and racketeering . A Hungarian man has been convicted of luring young, gay Eastern European men to the United States for a horrific life of sex slavery. Andras Janos Vass, 25, was found guilty of human trafficking and racketeering felonies this week after grooming fellow Hungarians online then keeping them captive in New York City and Miami. Vass brought men to America with the promises of easy work and high wages - then took their travel documents, threatened their families, and made them spend 20 hours a day on sex work, prosecutors said. He was found guilty of the offences by a jury in Miami-Dade on Thursday, the Miami Herald reported. He faces a maximum sentence of 155 years in prison - and will spend at least 21 behind bars. Three of Vass's victims testified against him at the trial. Two said they were tempted to the United States after being contacted via Planet Romeo, a free dating site. According Gay Star News, the men believed they would be employed as legal escorts and make between $3,000 and $5,000 a month. The victims said they were flown to New York City in 2012 and forced to live in a tiny one-bedroom apartment. They were forced to perform sex work at all hours, either in person or live on webcams. Lure: Prosecutors said at least two of the victims were lured to America via the Planet Romeo gay dating website . According to online listings, Vass's company, Never Sleep Inc., was based at an address in Sunset Park, Brooklyn in New York City. In August 2012, prosecutors said, the Vass and his associates moved the business to Miami. Vass is accused of running the sex ring with two other men, Gabor Acs and Viktor Berki, who have yet to stand trial. Victims said that they had their passports taken when they arrived and that Berki, a former policeman, threatened their families in Hungary. Vass is due to be sentenced on June 2."
"Robert Rainey, known as Archie, is understood to have suffered a heart attack in one of the stands at about 18:00 local time.
Medics tried to resuscitate the 62-year-old Belfast man inside the stadium but he was later pronounced dead.
His family said he died ""doing what he loved best"".
In a statement, they said: ""Our father has sadly passed away whilst in France supporting Northern Ireland at the Euros, surrounded by all his friends and family.
""We are obviously devastated at this loss, and thankful for everyone's thoughts and prayers.""
Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill said he and his squad were ""all shocked when we heard this sad news after the game"".
""The thoughts of all the players and the backroom staff are with Robert's family and friends at this time.""
The Irish Football Association (IFA) said it will request that Northern Ireland players can wear black armbands during the team's game against Germany on Tuesday as a mark of respect to Mr Rainey.
He is the second Northern Ireland fan to die in France this week.
Early on Monday morning, 24-year-old Darren Rodgers, from Ballymena in County Antrim, died after a fall from a promenade in Nice.
The incident happened just hours after Northern Ireland's opening game of the tournament against Poland.
Northern Ireland's players wore black armbands during the win over Ukraine in Lyon in memory of Mr Rodgers.
There was also a minute's applause by supporters inside the ground in the 24th minute of the game as a tribute to him.
After Mr Rainey's death, Supt Nigel Goddard, of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, said: ""Our thoughts are tragically with a second family this week mourning the devastating loss of their loved one.""
Patrick Nelson, the IFA's chief executive, said the man's death during the game ""puts any result of a football match into perspective"".
John Delaney, the chief executive of the Football Association of Ireland, said the man's death was ""a sad outcome to what was a historic day for Northern Irish football""."
"The Germans overturned a 3-1 first-leg deficit against Porto, winning 6-1 to advance 7-4 on aggregate.
Guardiola's side scored five goals in a thrilling first half at Allianz Arena.
""I know how very important it was,"" the 44-year-old ex-Barcelona boss told ZDF Television. ""It is about winning just like at Barcelona.""
He added: ""It's easy to love my players now. I am the coach of extraordinary players. I didn't expect such a first half.
""We can still play better. We lost the ball here and there and we can improve on that. We had a few problems in the second half. They had only a few chances in the second half but you should never relax in the Champions League.""
Speaking before the game, Guardiola admitted the expectation at the Bundesliga club was to win the Champions League, and not just settle for domestic league and cup glory.
Striker Robert Lewandowski scored two and Thiago Alcantara, Jerome Boateng, Thomas Muller and Xabi Alonso also netted as Bayern dominated their Portuguese visitors.
Porto barely troubled Bayern in the first half, and Guardiola added: ""We played a different game. We knew Porto better after the first game.
""Now we have to fight otherwise we will not achieve what we set out to do.""
Bayern scored their first four goals inside 28 minutes and their fifth in the 40th minute, and even prolific goal-scorer Lewandowski was surprised at the half-time scoreline.
""Many people thought we couldn't do it, but we are FC Bayern Munich,"" said Lewandowski. ""We knew we had to step on the gas, but to go five goals up at half-time is really crazy.""
Germany striker Thomas Muller added: ""It couldn't have gone better. Sometimes it's fun to play with your backs against the wall. We all had hopes, but no-one expected that.""
BBC Radio 5 live's Pat Nevin at the Allianz Arena: ""Bayern were ruthlessly efficient in the first half. They were brilliant, scored great goals against a poor team.
""But they made some tactical changes and looked bordering on anaemic in the second half. They didn't look up for it. They could have been pulled back in the end but there's more to come from this team.
""The Champions League got predictable a long time ago. It's a little bit of a shame. We try not to be biased during commentary but Porto were the last of the little teams and they've been absolutely whacked, swatted like flies out of the way.
""There's always Spanish and German teams in the semi-finals, the odd time an Italian or English team but that's it. And even then it's the same teams. But it doesn't mean it's not exciting.""
Porto coach Julen Lopetegui accepted his side were beaten in a disastrous opening spell.
""We are very disappointed because we had a lot of expectations,"" he said. ""But it just turned bad very early on and it became difficult for us to play our game against such a good team. We lost the game in those 20 minutes in the first half.
""We tried to change things in the second half and I think we improved a bit but it was too late.
""We are sad, but we made a great campaign in this Champions League. In 11 matches this was our only defeat.
""Bayern is one of the best teams in the world and the favourite to win the title.""
Bayern boss Guardiola ripped his trousers during the game. Story and pictures here."
"Following Raheem Sterling's interview on Wednesday, in which he said he was not ready to sign a new contract at Liverpool, blogger David Tyrer of Live4Liverpool gives the view from Merseyside. While I hate to use social media as a gauge of opinions, Raheem Sterling’s interview didn’t go down well at all. It was ill-timed and, regardless of what Sterling and his agent hoped, he didn’t come across very well. Some of his answers only fuelled the fire really. I’m hoping that that wasn’t the whole point, as we’ve seen these sorts of situations engineered by agents before. The interview has almost certainly changed the way the fans feel about him. There will be a lot of fans that are of the opinion: ‘let him go’. Obviously, with the caveat that we get our money’s worth! Raheem Sterling returns to Liverpool training after the international break and shakes hands with manager Brendan Rodgers . Sterling risked angering Liverpool fans after he said in an interview he was not ready to sign a contract . Sterling trains ahead of the weekend's game with Arsenal . It’s always disappointing when a young player gets his head turned, but there’s a sense of ungratefulness about the whole situation, considering how the club has nurtured him and paid him well throughout. Personally, I think he has the potential to be worth so much more than the £100,000-a-week contract he’s turned down. But it’s only that: potential. At present, he’s arguably in the top five best young players in the world but, obviously at his age, he’s also prone to bouts of inconsistency and prolonged poor form. He hasn’t been great recently and was awful against Man Utd. Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal - the team he is preparing to face at the weekend . Raheem Sterling played for England in the 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania . And while I’d be willing to see the club give him £100k a week – possibly £120k a week - the club shouldn’t do everything it can to keep him. Definitely not. Liverpool fans have a popular mantra: no player is bigger than the club. Admittedly, we stretch the rules for truly great players (Suarez, a recent example) but Sterling is nowhere near. If he wants out, I’m sure the club will handle it the way they have before. Frustration over Sterling’s situation has been building for a while, and many fans are now of the belief that if he wants to go he’s welcome to. Personally, I don’t like players holding the club to ransom. He has as much chance of winning trophies here as he does anywhere (other than money-rich clubs such as Chelsea or Man City). Sterling did not have his best game in a Liverpool shirt during the defeat at Manchester United . Liverpool fans have a mantra that no player is bigger than the club . If Sterling was to move to Arsenal then it would not go down well with Liverpool fans . But if he does end up going, he’s worth a lot more than many established players. His ability is so raw but he has almost limitless potential. At the moment, we’ve seen it in fits and starts but even so, he’s easily worth £25-30 million. If I was FSG, I’d hold any interested club to ransom, though – double it. But a move to Arsenal wouldn’t go down well. Perhaps better than if it was Chelsea or Manchester United, but honestly there’s little Arsenal can offer that we can’t. Sure, they’re more financially stable but what – in terms of trophies – do Arsenal have to show for the last 12 years? Sterling speaks to the BBC and reveals he is not ready to sign a new contract . I think we’re somewhat ahead on that front. Much like Alexis Sanchez, any move to Arsenal will be more about location than anything else. People have drawn comparisons with when Suarez wanted to leave for Arsenal, but the situation is different. Suarez says he wanted Champions League football and we weren’t offering that at that time. Not only that, but Suarez was an established top-class player at the time, one of the best in the world. Sterling is purely potential and, given all the club have done for him (cliched, as that sounds), it makes little sense. If he’s going to be nurtured into the world-class talent he can become, it won’t happen at Arsenal. It may not necessarily happen at Anfield either, but a manager like Brendan Rodgers will give him the best shot of improving to that level over the next two to three years.

"A Mayfair mansion that was once the site of a milking parlour has gone on the market for £25million. The four-bedroom property in central London's Farm Street has all the trappings of modern luxury with an indoor swimming pool, gym, lift, cinema room and roof terrace. One hundred and fifty years ago however it was used to house cows for milking on one of London's busiest trading streets. Originally used as a milking parlour, it  became a depot before being knocked down in the 19th Century. In 2011 developers took over the site and demolished the house to make way for the plush mansion which now sits in its place. At 8,139 square ft, it is on the market for £25million. A newly-built mansion that was constructed on the site of a former milking parlour in Mayfair has gone on the market for £25million . The house is decorated throughout with modern furnishings and plush carpets. Among its features is a private lift and guest cloakroom . A grand piano sits in the marbled hall on one of the floor's houses. A 14-piece dining table is also featured in the luxury dining room . An indoor swimming pool now takes the place of what once would have been a milking shed in the 18th and 19th Century . A cinema room is one of the many modern features in the property. It was built in 2011 after developers knocked down the original structure . Impressive artwork throughout the house adorns its walls. It is being sold for £25million by estate agents Wetherell and Knight Frank . An opulent 14-place dining table is found on the first floor of the luxury property which also has its own lift . London's milking parlours date back to Tudor times, with Farm Street serving as hub of agricultural trade for years. Cows were brought there from the grazing areas of Peckham, Holland Park and Hampstead heath and sold to local butchers. Alongside the parlours was an abattoir and pub, the Punch Bowl, which remains. Guy Ritchie and Madonna bought the pub while they were married and it quickly became a celebrity favourite. Mr Ritchie sold it in 2013 to the Alexander Langlands Pearse. Inside the modern mansion are four bedrooms including a master suite which occupies the entire second floor. The lower ground floors feature a swimming pool complex with mosaic-lined pool, steam room, gym, shower and changing facilities, kitchenette, guest cloakroom and media room. It also has a private lift, marble flooring, a sweeping spiral staircase and a dining room which can seat 14. Speaking of the property, Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell, said: 'This recently built house is an outstanding example of contemporary living in historic Mayfair at its very best. 'As the location of Mayfair’s dairy, the interesting and unusual history allowed for the construction of a house on a commercial depot site, without the usual restrictions of historic listing controls. 'The result is an open flowing family house providing spacious rooms and generous ceiling heights rarely found in historic Mayfair.' The house has four bedrooms which all come with their own en suite bathrooms and is set over four floors. It was built in 2011 . One of the four bedrooms in the house is finished with sleek white, grey and black furniture and soft furnishings throughout . Another of the guest rooms in the luxury mansion furnished in cream and peach. The house has been described by estate agents as a 'flowing family house' One of the double bathrooms in the house has a deep marble bath, his and her's sinks and a large, walk-in shower . The property's master suite takes up the entire second floor with a huge bedroom and 'living space' which features a stunning fireplace . The dressing room in the master suite boasts high-gloss white wardrobes, fluffy white carpet and a grey bench for resting . An enormous jacuzzi bath in the middle of the master suite's bathroom, with his and her sinks and a walk in double shower beyond it . Another of the luxurious bathrooms is fitted with a black and grey bath and shower. Experts said the property was an example of 'contemporary living in historic Mayfair' A courtyard in the property offers another outdoor seating. Part of its tiles have been replaced with glass exposing the leisure complex beneath . The luxury home also has a steam room adorned in shimmer silver mosaic and several outdoor spaces for residents to take in sun . A sweeping sun terrace on the building's roof where residents and guests can take in views of the historic Mayfair village . A sleek white and brown kitchen leads out to a sun-trapped patio on one of the house's floors. There is also a kitchenette elsewhere . An aerial view of the staircase shows the house's four floors, with golden sculptures found on shelves the whole way down . A fully-equipped gym has also been installed in the basement of the house and even has a flat-screen TV fitted on a wall of mirrors . High quality finishings are seen throughout the property which is found in one of London's most exclusive areas ."
"Four constituents raised the action under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
They argued he misled the electorate over a memo claiming SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon would rather have seen David Cameron become prime minister.
Judges have ruled that there will now be a ""By Order hearing"" to discuss the next part of the case.
Lady Paton and Lord Matthews had heard a preliminary legal debate at a special Election Court, which examined three questions.
The first was whether section 106 of the act - which makes it illegal to make or publish false statements about any candidate during an election campaign - could apply to candidates talking about themselves, as well as attacks on their rivals.
The judges have ruled that the language used in section 106 was ""wide enough to encompass a statement made by a candidate about himself"".
However, they said they wanted to hear evidence about the two remaining issues before issuing a determination on the case.
These are whether the words were false statements of fact which related to Mr Carmichael's personal character or conduct, and whether they were said ""for the purpose of affecting the return of any candidate at the election"".
The judges said they wanted to hear evidence on these issues because each case had to be considered on its own facts.
Lady Paton said: ""Circumstances can be envisaged where a false statement of fact is of such a nature that the effect in relation to a candidate's personal character or conduct transcends the political context.
""The question of the type of relationship between the statement and the personal character and conduct of the first respondent is one which requires evidence, including evidence as to the motive or reason for giving the false statement.""
Mr Carmichael's QC had asked the judges to dismiss the case, on the grounds it was ""irrelevant"" and ""bound to fail"".
Legal argument was heard at a special election court in Edinburgh earlier this month, which was broadcast and streamed online live.
The case is believed to be the first of its kind in Scotland for 50 years.
It arose from a story in the Daily Telegraph at the start of the general election campaign in April.
Mr Carmichael - Scottish Secretary in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition before the election - had authorised the leaking of a civil service memo suggesting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had told the French ambassador she wanted David Cameron to remain in Downing Street.
He claimed in a TV interview the first he had heard of it was when he received a phone call from a journalist.
However, the MP later admitted full responsibility for sanctioning its release, and accepted the ""details of the account are not correct"".
The constituents who brought the petition were aided by crowd funding."
"The newly-designed form, used to apply for a divorce in England and Wales, asks for the name ""of the person your spouse has committed adultery with"".
Family lawyers say that, in most cases, involving a third party adds ""conflict and complexity"".
The Ministry of Justice said there was ""no obligation"" to name people.
Lawyer Margaret Heathcote, vice-chairwoman of family law group Resolution, is one of those concerned about the form.
""Generally speaking, we don't name the third party. It increases the conflict from day one,"" she said.
""There's no need. But because the box is there, the indication will be to fill it in.""
The online form has been updated to make the legal process more user-friendly - especially as some complete the process without seeking legal advice.
The guidance on the form highlights that it is ""not normally necessary"" to name the person your spouse committed adultery with.
But Georgina Hamblin, director at divorce lawyers, Vardags, said people are ""unlikely to read the much smaller print or choose to ignore it"".
The older version of the form left a space for so-called ""co-respondents"" to be named where appropriate.
""The new form flatly asks for 'the name of the person your spouse has committed adultery with',"" Ms Hamblin explained.
""This is an invitation which I fear most broken hearts will not be able to refuse.""
If you name the person your husband or wife committed adultery with, they become part of the court case.
They will be sent copies of the paperwork and given a chance to respond. If they don't respond, proceedings may be delayed and could incur more costs.
According to the latest statistics, there were just over 100,000 divorces granted in England and Wales in 2015.
Adultery was the reason for 12,148 of them. ""Unreasonable behaviour"" accounted for 46,815.
Ms Hamblin said 80% of the new clients she deals with in matters of adultery ""want to get the new partner involved and to have their chance to say what they think of them"".
""But it puts the petitioner in a bad light. We have to talk clients down from doing that,"" she said.
""Judges take a very dim view of petitioners trying to bring in new partners and embroil them in proceedings.""
When you apply for a divorce you must prove your marriage has broken down and give one of the following reasons:
Source: Gov.UK
A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""It has always been possible for a petitioner to name the person they believe their spouse has committed adultery with on divorce application forms.
""As set out in the previous form, and more clearly in the new form, there is obviously no obligation to do so. This is a relevant part of divorce proceedings."""
"Robert Bates, 73, shot and killed a man while playing cops and robbers with real police. Bates was a reserve deputy sheriff, which allowed him to ""work full time jobs in the community and volunteer ... time in a myriad of events such as the Special Olympics and Tulsa State Fair,"" according to the Tulsa County Sheriff Office's website. But Bates wasn't limited to crowd control at sporting events for the disabled. He had taken part in more than 100 operations with the violent crimes task force, according to his lawyer.  On April 2, Bates thought he was going to use a Taser on Eric Harris, who deputies had just tackled after he sold an undercover officer a Lugar pistol and then took off running. But Bates wasn't holding a Taser. He was holding his gun. He fired one shot and killed Harris. From a policing perspective, there wasn't even good reason to use a Taser against Harris. Cops were on scene. Harris wasn't getting the upper hand. He wasn't going anywhere. And despite what Bates would later claim, Harris was not running like a man with a gun. In fact, Harris was running fast and his arms were pumping very much like a man who is not protecting a gun in his waistband. What was Bates, an insurance company CEO, doing there in the first place? It certainly looks like Bates was given special access to ""real"" policing. Harris had given $2,500 to Sheriff Stanley Glanz's re-election campaign. He donated cars to the department. He gave equipment. So it would be noteworthy if Bates ends up being convicted based on evidence provided by ""sunglass cameras"" that he may have purchased for the department. A Tulsa police official said the agency has 130 reserve deputies, many of them wealthy people who make donations to the police. ""That's not unusual at all,"" he told the Tulsa World. Maybe Bates could have been a reserve deputy without donating anything. But I doubt there are many volunteer septuagenarians working with the violent crimes task force. He was too old to be policing the streets. Tulsa police said that Bates had served a year in 1964 as a police officer. Most police departments have mandatory retirement ages. Federal law-enforcement officers, for instance, retire at 57. How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? Police officers generally look with a skeptical eye toward volunteers. For one thing, it makes it tougher to push for a pay raise when people are offering to do your job for free. But departments also know that you get what you pay for. What is the point of background checks, psychological tests and the professional training police undergo if a person can donate a few grand and go out on patrol? Some people are a little too eager to be police officers. These people perhaps buy a police-like car for their personal car. Maybe they put in a police light or two. Some have actually made car stops. Police departments hate cop impersonators (it's illegal, by the way) and try and weed them during the hiring process. You want workers who like the job, but not too much; there's a fine line between passion and fanaticism. That said, there are good volunteer police officers. New York City, for example, has auxiliary police. These officers received more limited training and they help with neighborhood events and other nonenforcement activities. They wear an NYPD uniform but do not carry a gun. Auxiliary police and similar programs reinforce the notion that the police are the public and the public are the police. Volunteers remind us all that policing is a noble public calling, and most police work does not have to be done by overly militarized SWAT officers. An auxiliary program also allows young recruits a way to dip their foot into the police world before taking the plunge. It can be a great benefit to everybody when potential officers discover the job isn't for them before they are locked into a 20-year commitment. What happened in Tulsa County is a disgrace to police professionalism, and the fallout from this disaster may push police departments to end these kinds of programs. That would be a mistake. Police departments should encourage more productive interactions between police and the public. But a line does need to be drawn."
"When Liana Barrientos was 23 years old, she got married in Westchester County, New York. A year later, she got married again in Westchester County, but to a different man and without divorcing her first husband.  Only 18 days after that marriage, she got hitched yet again. Then, Barrientos declared ""I do"" five more times, sometimes only within two weeks of each other. In 2010, she married once more, this time in the Bronx. In an application for a marriage license, she stated it was her ""first and only"" marriage. Barrientos, now 39, is facing two criminal counts of ""offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree,"" referring to her false statements on the 2010 marriage license application, according to court documents. Prosecutors said the marriages were part of an immigration scam. On Friday, she pleaded not guilty at State Supreme Court in the Bronx, according to her attorney, Christopher Wright, who declined to comment further. After leaving court, Barrientos was arrested and charged with theft of service and criminal trespass for allegedly sneaking into the New York subway through an emergency exit, said Detective Annette Markowski, a police spokeswoman. In total, Barrientos has been married 10 times, with nine of her marriages occurring between 1999 and 2002.  All occurred either in Westchester County, Long Island, New Jersey or the Bronx. She is believed to still be married to four men, and at one time, she was married to eight men at once, prosecutors say. Prosecutors said the immigration scam involved some of her husbands, who filed for permanent residence status shortly after the marriages.  Any divorces happened only after such filings were approved. It was unclear whether any of the men will be prosecuted. The case was referred to the Bronx District Attorney's Office by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security's Investigation Division. Seven of the men are from so-called ""red-flagged"" countries, including Egypt, Turkey, Georgia, Pakistan and Mali. Her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, was deported in 2006 to his native Pakistan after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. If convicted, Barrientos faces up to four years in prison.  Her next court appearance is scheduled for May 18."
"From bank overdraft fees to charges for booking tickets and even spending a penny, being a consumer can be a very expensive business. But of all the fees consumers have to fork out for the ones they hate the most are unreasonable parking charges, a survey found. They topped a table of the most-loathed fees and charges in the poll by insurer Direct Line, followed by ATM cash withdrawal fees and debit and credit card surcharges for booking items such as air travel. Most-loathed: A poll found that parking charges topped the list of fees and charges that frustrate consumers the most. A total of 48 per cent thought they should be free, while 31 per cent said they are too high . Asked about their frustration with such charges, 48 per cent said they should be free, while 31 per cent thought they are too high and 15 per cent say they are often hidden. Direct Line spokesman Gus Park said: ‘These types of fees and charges can be very frustrating because they tend to cover things that we either feel entitled to or think we have already paid for as part of another product or service.’ It is hardly surprising that parking costs infuriate drivers as the fines are often extortionate compared to the price of a ticket. Parking charges and fines made councils in England a record £667million last year, according to figures from the RAC Foundation – up 12 per cent on the previous year. Most ATMs are free to use, but those in places such as nightclubs and some corner shops can charge around £1.50 to withdraw cash. Renewing a passport was made £5 cheaper to £72.50 in 2012, but it is still a hefty sum that stands in the way of a foreign holiday. Annoyance: Also high up on the list of most-hated charges are ATM cash withdrawal fees. Most ATMs are free to use, but those in places such as nightclubs and some corner shops can charge around £1.50 ."
"The 21-year-old told BBC Sport last year that he was considering an approach from Algeria.
The Lille striker was born in France and played for them at every youth level from under-16 but is eligible for Algeria through his parents.
The Algeria Football Federation said it ""will immediately begin the process of registering the player with Fifa.""
The federation added Benzia met its president Mohamed Raouraoua this week to finalise his choice to play for the Desert Foxes.
Even though Fifa is yet to receive Benzia's request for a switch of nationality, the Algerian football authority is confident of a swift approval by the game's governing body.
Benzia has scored 26 goals in 43 appearances during his time playing for France's youth teams.
His capture will come as a morale boost for Algeria after they were snubbed by Lyon striker Nabil Fekir last year.
Benzia started his career at Lyon where he progressed from the academy to the senior squad and made his senior debut against Nice in May 2012.
He switched to Ligue 1 rivals Lille in August 2015 in search of regular football and has already scored five goals in 20 appearances for the club this season."
"Christopher Hannah was driving a car which mounted the pavement and struck Sophie Brannan in Sandbank Street, Maryhill, on 14 November last year.
Her friend Chelsea Sommerville, and Chelsea's uncle, Joseph Lloyd, were also badly injured.
At the High Court in Glasgow, 33-year-old Hannah, who is said to be a heroin addict, admitted a charge of culpable homicide. Sentence was deferred.
Following his guilty plea, the investigating officer Det Insp Colin Hailstones said: ""This was an appallingly tragic case.
""Many people in the community in Maryhill were deeply affected by this incident, particularly as it resulted in the death of young Sophie Brannan, whose life was sadly taken away from her at the age of 11 and at the hands of someone under the influence of drugs.
""Police officers worked tirelessly to piece together the events of that fateful night and I must thank the many members of the local community and those injured who helped provide information about the incident.""
He added: ""The strength shown from the community towards Sophie's family and the other people who were injured is unquestionable and much support continues to be given to them.""
The court heard that Hannah was driving a hired Vauxhall Astra in the area and lost control.
He then fully mounted the pavement before hitting the gable end of a nearby building.
The car continued to career forward eventually ploughing into Sophie and the two people with her from behind.
Prosecutor Allan Nicol said: ""This caused them to be thrown onto the bonnet, windscreen and roof of the vehicle before falling onto the ground.""
Another driver witnessed the crash and turned back to help Sophie.
More witnesses saw Hannah speed onto nearby Maryhill Road with his badly-dented car being ""driven erratically"".
He then crashed into a taxi whose driver decided to follow Hannah, who eventually stopped a short distance away.
Mr Nicol added: ""At that point, the accused was trying to pull the damaged front bumper then he stopped and walked away before starting to run off.
""Both the taxi driver and his passengers noticed that he was under the influence of some substance.""
Medics found Sophie lying on the pavement. She was rushed to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill where she was found to have swelling to her brain, several fractures and broken bones.
The schoolgirl remained in intensive care overnight but was pronounced dead on the morning of 15 November.
The court heard that Chelsea suffered a serious leg break which will require long-term physiotherapy.
She continues to wear a cast several months after the tragedy.
Mr Nicol added: ""She also suffers episodes of withdrawal and angry outbursts.
""She is due to attend for psychiatric assessment in order to come to terms with her injuries and the loss of Sophie.""
Chelsea's uncle also suffered a number of fractures, but was initially released from hospital two days later.
However, he eventually required surgery and it is likely he will have ""long-term restriction"" of movement in his right shoulder.
Police discovered the Astra had been hired in Hannah's name on 14 October.
The court also heard that shortly after the incident, police searched the home of Hannah's partner, where he had been staying.
Mr Nicol said tin foil wraps with signs of drug use were discovered.
The prosecutor told the court: ""On the day in question, she suspected he had been taking heroin as she was aware he is heroin-dependent.""
His partner revealed Hannah had come home earlier that night ""in shock"".
Hannah had claimed he had hit someone, but did not know who.
The killer said he was going to a house in the city's south side, but would return.
Police were at the house when Hannah then called his girlfriend. She handed the phone to an officer and Hannah said: ""I'm sorry - I didn't mean to do it.
""It was a total accident. I lost control of the car and I panicked. I'm going to hand myself in tonight.""
The court heard that in the early hours of 17 November, Hannah turned up at a house in the city's Mount Florida area, but those inside decided to call police.
Officers turned up and arrested Hannah, who initially tried to escape. He was later searched and eight grams of heroin were discovered inside his boxer shorts.
The court heard how the occupants of the Mount Florida property later told police Hannah had called them on the night of the killing.
Hannah said at the time: ""There's been an accident - watch the news. The police have fitted me up.
""I tried to get away and I have hit something. I don't know what.""
Mr Nicol told the court: ""He went on to say he had driven like a madman and that the something he had hit could have been a wheelie bin...but he didn't hang about to find out.""
Hannah asked to stay for a while as the police were after him ""because he had killed a wee lassie"".
Accident investigators later concluded Hannah was solely to blame for what happened.
It was stated he took ""a conscious decision"" to drive while ""impaired"".
They added that the reason for him not stopping was because he knew he had taken drugs and was ""aware of the ramifications"".
As well as culpable homicide, Hannah also pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, attempting to defeat the ends of justice and possessing heroin.
It emerged he already had 14 previous convictions for crimes including having an offensive weapon and road traffic charges.
He was on bail at the time, having been freed from Glasgow's Justice of the Peace Court two months before the crash.
Hannah's advocate Thomas Ross said: ""He has asked to state publicly his apologies for those affected by this terrible tragedy.""
Lord Bannatyne remanded Hannah in custody and deferred sentencing until May."
"Four men have been caught on CCTV  robbing a service station and packing $38,000 worth of cigarettes into a doona cover. However they struggled to fit their large loot into the boot and lost about a third of it as they dragged the stash alongside the car during their getaway. The group of  men, all wearing hooded jumpers, gloves and masking their faces, broke into the service station  on Burwood Highway, Tecoma in Melbourne's outer east on April 2. Scroll down for video . Four men have been caught on CCTV robbing a service station in Tecomba, Melbourne . They are all wanted by Victoria Police for a series of break-ins on at least five different establishments in the area. Police revealed that the first man  had a solid build and was wearing a white hooded jumper with a dark hood over the top, red pants and runners. The second  had a thin build and was wearing a dark blue hooded jumper white a white logo on the front, dark shorts and runners. The third man had a thin build and was wearing a red hooded jumper, dark track pants with a white stripe and runners. The men filled a doona cover with $38,000 worth of cigarettes . However they failed to get the large loot in the boot . They are clearly seen in the footage holding crowbars and forcing their way into the premises. Not long after the break-in, three men appear with an overflowing doona cover filled to the brim with cigarettes. The driver gets out of the car and tries to help the men fit the massive loot in the boot. They decided to drag it alongside the car instead and lost about a third of their stash . When they realised it was too big for the boot, the men had to think of other ways to get away with their loot . When they realises that it is far too big, they all hop into the car, with the thief sitting in the passenger seat deciding to keep his car door ajar and drag the sack along next to it as they drive away. According to Victoria Police, the men lost about a third of their loot during the getaway. The men are also wanted for a burglary at a shopping centre on Mt Dandenong Road, Kilsyth on March 18. The thief in the passenger seat kept his door open during the getaway . The doona was dragged alongside the car and the men lost a third of their loot . The men are wanted for five similar break-ins in the area . Four men broke into the centre and targeted a speciality store about 1.30am, filling another doona cover with cigarettes before leaving. Investigators believe the same men returned to the same store on 31 March, but couldn't gain access. Police believe the same men targeted three service stations 8 April including one on Warburton Highway, Lilydale, a station on Bell Street St, Yarra Glen and another on Ryans Road, Eltham North."
"All 42 Scottish clubs discussed league reconstruction on Tuesday, with a 16-team top-flight among the proposals.
That is the number of teams in the Czech top division and Fitzel believes young talent would have a greater chance to shine in a bigger league.
""I am sure a 16-team league has helped our youth development,"" he said.
Fitzel was involved with the Czech youth teams from 1998 to 2005, and helped bring through the likes of Tomas Rosicky and Petr Cech.
After a spell as the national coach of Malta he has returned as technical director and general manager of the Czech Republic national team. Fitzel has overseen improved fortunes at all levels of the game after the country missed on qualification for the 2010 World Cup.
Since then, the Czech Republic were quarter-finalists in the 2012 European Championships and finished top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group.
""If we did not have a 16-team league and we only had 12, only a few youth players would get a chance,"" Fitzel told BBC Scotland.
""The bigger the league, the more teams are playing at a higher level, and the more young players are getting a chance. The more they play, the more they improve through experience of playing in the top league.""
From next season, the Czech First League will be ranked nine places above Scotland in the Uefa coefficient rankings, with two teams qualifying for the Champions League qualifiers.
However, Fitzel admits a 16-team league does have its pitfalls and they could end up moving in the opposite direction.
""Currently here in the Czech Republic we are discussing maybe having 10 or 12 teams playing each other four times,"" Fitzel said. ""At the moment we do not play enough games.
""A 16-team league has allowed us to have a winter break of two-and-a-half months. We finish at the end of December and start again at the beginning of March. But it means we only play 14 games in spring and all the clubs are saying we should have more games.
""In a smaller league, maybe there are more interesting games. We are looking at the ice hockey league, where right now they have play-offs and the stadia there is sold-out; even the relegation play-offs. That's fantastic income for the clubs and the stadiums hold 13,000 - 15,000 people.""
Fitzel, like many in Europe, has looked on with interest at the Scottish game in the last few years. He says the 12-12-18 set-up that was proposed in 2013 was interesting, but feels clubs should listen to what the supporters want.
""It's an interesting idea,"" he added. ""It is something new, and I always feel if you don't try it then you don't know.
""From my point of view it is interesting to play for relegation or promotion. It could be a long period of games.
""It seems interesting, but the question is do the people want to see this?
""If you have enough teams for a 16 top division, they don't need to be equal. Obviously in Scotland you have two big teams, though now there is a problem with Rangers playing out-with the top tier, but still there is two or three dominant teams."""
"Singer-songwriter Don McLean's original manuscript and notes to 'American Pie' have been sold at auction for $1.2 million. McLean offered the wistful anthem that asks 'Do you recall what was revealed the day the music died?' at Christie's on Tuesday. The name of the buyer was not released. The 16 pages include the original working manuscript and typed drafts of the song, including tantalizing new details about the famous anthem. In an interview published by Christie's auction house New York, where the manuscript was auctioned, McLean says American Pie is about 'heading in the wrong direction'. Scroll down for video . Original song: Christie's curator Tom Lecky holds the 16-page notes and manuscript for singer Don McLean's American Pie at Christie's auction house in New York where it was sold for $1.2million to an unidentified bidder on Tuesday . 'It is becoming less idyllic. I don't know whether you consider that wrong or right but it is a morality song in a sense.' It has long been known that the song about 'the day the music died' refers to February 3, 1959, when rock n' roll icon Buddy Holly and fellow singers Ritchie Valens and J.P. 'Big Bopper' Richardson died in a plane crash. The eight-minute-long song was released in 1971 and was a No. 1 U.S. hit for four weeks in 1972. McLean, 69, a longtime Maine resident, says writing the song was 'a mystical trip into his past.' Legendary singer: The original manuscript also reveals a deleted verse, which was crossed out and never recorded, where McLean, now 69, writes about music being 'reborn'. Loss: American Pie mourns the death of late-50s rock n' roll icon Buddy Holly,  who died in a plane crash on February 3 1959, aged just 22, which is what McLean refers to as 'the day music died' Tragedy: J.P. 'Big Bopper' Richardson and Ritchie Valens also died in the crash alongside Buddy Holly . The original manuscript also reveals a deleted verse, which was crossed out and never recorded, about music being 'reborn'. It includes the lines 'I dropped to my knees and there I prayed and I promised him everything I could give. 'If only he would make the music live,' according to the Telegraph. American Pie had a  revival in 2000 when Madonna covered the song to promote the soundtrack to her flop film The Next Best Thing. Despite the Queen of Pop describing the cover as 'something a certain record company executive twisted my arm into doing' in 2001, her version of American Pie became a global chart hit. Christie's New York is estimating that  the American Pie manuscript will sell for $1million to $1.5million."
"The study, by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), added that households actually grew richer during the financial crisis.
But it said that the reason for the growth between 2006-12 was the increase in pension values over the period.
And the slow rate of growth in overall wealth suggested that young people would lag behind earlier generations.
Dave Innes, a research economist at the IFS and an author of the report said: ""Despite the financial crisis, household wealth on average increased in real terms over the late 2000s, driven by increases in private pension entitlements.""
Households aged between 45-54 saw the biggest increases in their pension wealth which rose on average by Â£38,000 over the period.
Mr Innes added: ""Even with these increases in average wealth, working-age households are at risk of being less wealthy at each age than those born a decade earlier.""
The report added that the range of experiences among the study group was vast - for example, a quarter of households aged 45-54 saw wealth fall by more than Â£69,000, while a quarter say their wealth increased by more than Â£138,000.
The study also looked at people's attitude towards saving and pensions. 30% of individuals reported saving for an unexpected expense, 23% reported saving for holidays or leisure, 15% for planned expenses, 10% for other people and only 10% to provide a retirement income.
Among households aged 25-34, nearly one-quarter (24%) did not expect to receive any income from the state pension in retirement.
However, one third expected it would be their largest source of income after retirement.
Despite new legislation that automatically enrols workers into workplace pension schemes, nearly half (44%) did not expect to receive any income from a private pension.
Rowena Crawford, a Senior Research Economist at the IFS and another author of the report, said: ""It is striking how many individuals do not expect private pensions to have a role in financing their retirement, let alone be their main source of income.""
""It will be interesting to see how these attitudes change as auto enrolment into workplace pensions is rolled out."""
"The Amateur International Boxing Association has said pro boxers will compete in Rio if a constitutional change is agreed next month.
But Tyson, 49, a former Junior Olympic winner, said: ""Some pro fighters are going to get beat by the amateurs.
""It's just going to happen, I really believe that.""
Tyson won gold at the 1981 and 1982 Junior Olympics and, speaking at the 33rd IBF convention in China, said professional boxers would find the fast-paced fighting style of their amateur counterparts difficult to contend with.
""If they are like the amateur fighters that I was fighting in the 80s... they are going to beat some of the champions, it's just going to happen,"" he insisted.
Lennox Lewis, another former world heavyweight champion and Olympic gold medallist, is also not in favour of the idea, branding it ""preposterous"".
Tyson has also revealed he is an admirer of Briton and controversial current world champion Tyson Fury.
Fury ended Wladimir Klitschko's nine-year reign as champion in November but has become better know since for a string of outspoken remarks.
""One guy, Tyson Fury, I like to watch him because he has my name and stuff,"" Tyson said. ""Everybody says 'ah, he's a bum', but I like him.
""He beat Klitschko, so what are you going to say? That this guy is still a bum, but he beat the greatest fighter in the last 15 years?"""
"A blue plaque has been unveiled recognising the work of Edward ""Taffy"" Bowen, outside his childhood home on Stepney Lane, Cockett.
The physicist's work contributed to the development of radar technology, which aided the allies in World War Two.
He grew up in the city and graduated from Swansea University in 1930.
Mr Bowen also played a key role in developing radio astronomy in the United States and Australia.
""Edward Bowen's work in helping develop radar and radio astronomy is the stuff of legend,"" said Cllr Robert Francis-Davies, Swansea Council's cabinet member for enterprise, development and regeneration.
""The world we live in could be very different if it wasn't for his genius because his work helped give the Allies a crucial advantage during the Second World War."""
"The Saints boss had been linked with Rangers and Aberdeen in recent months.
And the Perth club's chairman, Steve Brown, has spoken of his surprise that no other club has come in for Wright.
""I think he's worried about me coming into the last two years of my contract, that he's not going to get any compensation for me and that would panic him a bit,"" joked Wright, 53.
""I'm happy here. It is nice that you are linked with other jobs and so-called bigger clubs because that really means people realise the job you're doing here.
""That's the most important thing for me. I'm looking forward to this season, playing in Europe and doing well for St Johnstone.""
As it turned out, Pedro Caixinha took over from Mark Warburton at Ibrox and Derek McInnes has chosen to remain at Pittodrie, despite having discussions about the Sunderland vacancy, leaving Wright in charge at McDiarmid Park.
In his four years at St Johnstone, and on a modest budget, he has guided them to the Scottish Cup, in 2014, and secured top-six finishes every season in the Premiership.
Asked if he was surprised that his record had not led to approaches from other clubs, Wright told BBC Scotland: ""I'd be lying if I said I wasn't, but it's not something that keeps me awake at night.
""It's not something that, if I see someone else getting a job, puts me in a bad mood. It's just the way it is and all I can do is keep doing my job here.
""I'm quite happy for the chairman to come and extend my contract at St Johnstone if he wants, but by the look of his comments he'd rather sell me and get a few quid in.
""I just have a simple way of looking at things - do the job to the best of your ability, do it well and whatever will happen will happen.""
Wright has been preparing his squad at Inverclyde Sports Centre in Largs for another crack at the Europa League, their reward for finishing fourth last term.
Having lost Danny Swanson to newly promoted Hibernian and now defender Tam Scobbie to Scottish Championship club Dundee United, Wright is looking to strengthen his squad.
He's in the process of clinching a deal to replace Swanson in time for the European signing deadline but the Scobbie departure has been a bit of a shock and it comes at a time when fellow defender Brian Easton is being treated for a groin problem.
""There is a risk Brian may miss Europe and that certainly leaves us short in terms of a left-back,"" said the Northern Irishman.
""I wanted Thomas {Scobbie} re-signed. I know he was more than happy to stay, but something's happened that it's fallen through so I've got to deal with that.
""It's part of management, you don't always get what you want and now we've got to move on and do the best for the club. I'm now putting all my efforts in to get a left-back to be cover for losing Thomas.""
Wright drew praise for his handling of the infamous New Douglas Park brawl between Swanson and team-mate Richard Foster as they left the pitch at half-time in the match with Hamilton.
But the manager says that incident on 1 April was one of the toughest tests of his managerial career.
""I didn't see it and still haven't seen it because there's no footage of it, which is a miracle these days,"" he said.
""Immediately after the game, when I'm hearing what's allegedly happened, there was one thought in my head: that the two of them can go, they're out, they're sacked.
""But then it was time for calm heads and leadership from the club and myself. The lads very quickly helped the situation by admitting they were wrong, they were remorseful.
""So come the Saturday night they definitely weren't going to be sacked, but the chairman and I felt that for the image of the club we'd deal with this as severely and as quickly as we could (with a fine and reprimand).
""We were honest with the players, in terms of how we felt they had let not only themselves down, but the club and Scottish football as a whole.
""The timing of it could have derailed our season. We actually lost the game 1-0, losing a goal in the 91st minute after doing brilliantly with nine men and that was gut-wrenching for the players.""
Wright feels that by beating Hearts with a weakened squad and then Inverness in Saints' next two games, it showed the benefit of  ""having good people and a good squad"".
On Monday, St Johnstone will find out who they will face in the first qualifying round of the Europa League."
"Messy homes can understandably be a huge source of embarrassment for home owners. But it's fair to say that everyone can admit to getting lazy with the cleaning every now and again. It turns out old mugs of tea, toothpaste-encrusted bathrooms and mouldy food are among the top 'cleaning sins' committed by busy Brits. A study by Kärcher has revealed six in ten Brits are too busy to clean their homes . A study of 2,000 people by cleaning equipment company, Kärcher, revealed that a whopping six in ten full-time working Brits are too busy to clean their homes each week. Even more shocking is that now, three months into the new year, many have avoided certain cleaning jobs all together. One in eight haven't vacuumed at all this year so far; a fifth never polish or dust their home and a quarter have never cleaned their windows before. Some of the top 'cleaning sins' committed by Brits include old mugs of tea and mouldy food left to fester . Other top ranking 'cleaning sins' include leaving hair in the plug hole, only changing bed sheets once a month and letting exploded food in the microwave fester. According to research, it seems that more than a quarter (25%) only do housework if they absolutely have to. And when it came to those in relationships? Women were less likely to feel that their partner pulled their weight around the house. UK Home and Garden Marketing Manager of Kärcher, Phil Springall, has said: 'For many people, workloads are increasing and weekly routines are often hectic. 1. Food stains from splattering . 2. Finger marks on the mirror . 3. Leaving dust on the skirting board and on the bannister . 4. Toothpaste stains on the sink . 5. Leaving expired food in the fridge . 6.

It also turns out that messy homes aren't the only source of embarrassment for Brit home owners. A study, commissioned by mouldable glue company,Sugru, has revealed that a huge six in ten Brits are embarrassed of their houses. Other reasons that Brits are embarrassed by their houses are unfinished DIY jobs, mouldy patches, cigarette odour and even antisocial neighbours. It also came down to the actual house itself, with many citing bad location, dated kitchen units and the actual size as embarrassing components. So it seems only natural that many peoople would make comparisons to cleaner, fictional on-screen abodes. The research also revealed the top ten houses that Brits would most like to recreate. With luxurious gilded interiors, chandeliers in every room and plush velvety fittings, it's not hard to see why Brits love this house. Filmed at Highclere House in North Hampshire . 1.

"The Belgium international, 24, changed the game from the bench but fell awkwardly in injury time.
His agent Patrick de Koster initially said De Bruyne would miss six weeks.
But, after seeing a specialist, the £55m former Wolfsburg player said: ""I'll be out for around 10 weeks.""
De Bruyne could miss up to 13 league and cup games, including the League Cup final with Liverpool on 28 February, both legs of the Champions League last-16 tie with Dynamo Kiev and the Manchester derby on 20 March.
The Belgian is City's second top goalscorer with 12 this season, four behind striker Sergio Aguero.
De Koster added: ""Kevin told me the only thing he can do is work hard and come back. Kevin is sad. His dream is to always be playing football.""
De Bruyne scored one goal and set up another to help City to a 4-3 aggregate victory over the Toffees.
Everton goalkeeper Joel Robles, who repeatedly tried to lift up De Bruyne as he lay injured, used social media to say sorry.
""I would like to apologise to Kevin de Bruyne for my reaction to his injury,"" said the 25-year-old Spaniard.
""In the heat of the moment I didn't realise he was badly hurt. I wish him all the best and a speedy recovery."""
"The Barcelona striker is ahead of team-mate Lionel Messi, who is valued by academics at £149m.
The only England players in the top 10 are Tottenham duo Harry Kane (worth £122m) and Dele Alli (£96m).
Paul Pogba, who joined Manchester United for a record £89m in the summer, is worth £136.4m.
The study has been carried out by a team of academics from the CIES Football Observatory, using a transfer value algorithm.
They have calculated the value using criteria that includes player performance and characteristics, such as age and length of contract.
Cristiano Ronaldo, the Ballon d'Or winner and Fifa's world's best player, is seventh on the list at £111m, with Real Madrid team-mate Gareth Bale 14th and valued at £73.8m, less than the £85.3m he cost the La Liga side in 2013.
Pogba is the only player in the top five not based in Spain, with Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann third at £132m and Barcelona's Luis Suarez fifth (£127m).
There are 42 Premier League players in the top 100 including Chelsea's Eden Hazard (£89m), Manchester United's Anthony Martial (£81m), Manchester City's Raheem Sterling (£75m) and Leicester City's Jamie Vardy (£45m).
West Ham midfielder Michail Antonio makes the list at 100, with a value of £31m."
"Bayern Munich will be without midfielders Bastian Schweinsteiger and Franck Ribery when they travel to Porto for Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg. Frenchman Ribery is not yet fully fit following a five-week absence with an ankle injury while Schweinsteiger has had a virus for the past few days. 'Bastian and Franck will not be with us against Porto. That is bitter,' sports director Matthias Sammer said on Monday as the problems started to pile up for the treble-chasing Bavarians. Bayern boss Pep Guardiola has a long injury list to contend with as he aims for domestic and European glory . Bastian Schweinsteiger lies injured on the pitch during Bayern's 1-0 win against Borussia Dortmund on April 4 .

"Lesbos used to get more than 5,000 a day. On Monday there were just four.
But with Europe's borders closed, more than 50,000 migrants remain in Greece waiting for a decision about their futures.
Angus Crawford visited three sites to find out how they are living.
Miracle is sleeping. He cannot tell me anything about the conditions in Moria camp.
He is unaware of the smell of raw sewage that hangs around the entrance gate.  He does not know about the fighting between migrants that insiders say breaks out on a regular basis.
Luckily on Tuesday the tear gas fired by police at young migrants throwing stones never reached him.
He does not have to stand in line for hours to get food.
Miracle is just 10 months old and is strapped to his mother's back.
She tells me her name is Blessing. She says she is Nigerian, a Christian from Kano, and that she left because of the Islamist militants, Boko Haram.
I have no way of independently checking her story.
But here she is in Moria, once a transit camp for migrants, now since the EU deal with Turkey, a detention centre, run by central government.
There are several thousand people inside even though it was never built to house so many.
It is another sign of how Greece was simply overwhelmed by the numbers who came, while itself in the middle of an economic crisis.
Most of those who arrived before March 20, the start of the EU-Turkey agreement, are free to come and go, but cannot leave the island.
Those who came after that date are locked in, waiting for a decision about their asylum claims.
Moria's chain link fence, topped with razor wire, snakes on its way up into olive groves.  It surrounds a collection of converted shipping containers, large white plastic shelters and small tents.
I meet one man who says simply, ""in here, I fear for my life"".
'A hellish Glastonbury'
Five minutes drive away, another camp. There is no razor wire, no police guarding the gate. The first thing I see is an electronic display board.
It reads ""the camp director wishes you a pleasant and safe stay"".
There are orderly lines of white UN refugee agency tents. Children run up and down the pathways between them.
This is run by the council, for migrants who arrived before the 20th, and for the vulnerable: families with children, pregnant women and the disabled.
They can leave the camp, but not Lesbos.
One aid worker tells me it is the best camp he has seen.
It sits on top of a hill, surrounded on three sides by the Aegean. In the distance lie the ruins of a castle.
The facilities may be better and site picturesque, but those who I meet inside tell me it is still in effect an open air waiting room.
Amiyah is 19 and from Damascus. The rest of her family are in Germany. But she cannot join them.
Abdul, who is 16, complains about the food and says everyone is getting sick.
Tareq tells me he had only â‚¬50 left after paying a smuggler, but yesterday even that was stolen.
The migrant crisis in seven charts
The Plaza is an eight storey hotel not far from the centre of Athens. It has three stars and more than 60 rooms.
There are more than 140 guests, but none of them have to pay to stay.
The hotel was a casualty of the economic crash, going bankrupt in 2010 and closing its doors.
But last Friday a group of activists and former workers unlawfully reopened the Plaza, with migrants as guests.
The reception is manned by volunteers 24 hours a day and the kitchen turns out food. There are more than 70 children staying here.
When we visit there is laughter and singing from the playroom on the first floor.
And in a rack by the entrance, yellowing maps of Athens still waiting for the tourists who never came."
"University of Nairobi students were terrified Sunday morning when they heard explosions -- caused by a faulty electrical cable -- and believed it was a terror attack, the school said. Students on the Kikuyu campus stampeded down the halls of the Kimberly dormitory, and some jumped from its fifth floor, the university said. Hundreds were injured and were taken to hospitals. One person died, according to the school. The confusion and panic came less than two weeks after Al-Shabaab slaughtered 147 people at a college in Garissa, Kenya. Kenyan teachers and students have said they fear being targeted by the Somalia-based terrorists. On Sunday, as many as 108 students from the University of Nairobi were admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital. Among them, at least 63 students have been discharged, and at least four are slated for surgery, the school said. Almost all of the 54 students being treated at PCEA Kikuyu Hospital have been released, the university said. Kenya Power authorities and its CEO are at the school and looking into the electrical issue. Normal power supply will resume after repairs, the university said. ""As we mourn the unfortunate loss of the departed student, we are also praying for the quick recovery of those who were injured,"" said Vice Chancellor Peter M.F. Mbithi in a statement. He called on the students, staff and public to remain calm. CNN's Lillian Leposo reported from Nairobi and Ashley Fantz wrote this story in Atlanta."
"John Sutton Jr has spent the first Saturday of May the same way since he was 8 years old - on the sidelines of the Kentucky Derby. To commemorate his dedication to horse racing, Churchill Downs - the track that hosts the race every year - is inviting the 84-year-old man to attend his 76th-straight Kentucky Derby as their special guest on May 2. This week, Sutton invited a reporter from WAVE 3 into the Louisville home he shares with his wife of 61 years Doris, where she spoke about his very first Derby and showed off his impressive collection of racing memorabilia. Scroll down for video . Dedicated: Churchill Downs is inviting John Sutton Jr, 84, to attend the Kentucky Derby as their special guest on May 2, since he has attended every race for the past 76 years . Winner, winner: Sutton was just 8 years old in 1940 when his father brought him to his first race, and the two bet against the favorite on a horse called Gallahadion, which ended up winning the race . Among the masses: Above, a view of the crowds at Churchill Downs on the day of the 1940 race . Sutton says he was just 8 years old in 1940 when his blacksmith father brought him to his first Kentucky Derby. 'Once the race started, we would crash the gates, so to speak to get on the rail or wherever we could get,' Sutton recalled. That year, Sutton and his father decided to bet on the horse Gallahadion, instead of the favorite, Bimelech. And to their delight, Gallahadion pulled through to an unexpected victory that helped cement Sutton's love for the sport. Living history: Sutton has collected a program from every Kentucky Derby he has attended and keeps them in a binder at home. Above, some of the early years . Through the years: The Derby programs got more and more colorful over the years . Keepsakes: In addition to programs, Sutton has Kentucky Derby glasses stretching back more than seven decades . Autographs: Sutton got jockeys to sign several of his programs, which he proudly displays in frames at home . Entry: Above, some of the tickets Sutton has collected from the Kentucky Derby since 1940 . An eye for champions: Sutton won $600 dollars in 19567, when he bet on the winning horse Proud Clarion. Proud Clarion and jockey Bobby Ussery pictured above after placing first at Churchill Downs . Every year since then, Sutton has attended the Kentucky Derby and has collected each year's program since then, which he keeps in a binder at home. He also has kept a collection of his tickets, Derby glasses from the more than seven decades he has attended the race as well as pins and and other programs signed by jockeys. In his early years attending the Derby, Sutton says the day involved a bit of hard work going around to each betting window to buy tickets for his parents, and picking them up snacks for the main event on the way back. But he continues to come back year after year, placing his bets by averaging the past performances of the horses competing. That method won him one of his biggest prizes in 1967, when the then 35-year-old Sutton placed his money on winning horse Proud Clarion and got $600 in return. 'There's nothing like having a winning ticket,' he said, 'You just all of a sudden get smarter you know.'

"A taxi driver channelled his inner Pavarotti and produced an emotionally charged opera performance to the surprise of his customers. The Uber driver was filmed by passengers as he sang along to a radio broadcast while driving in Boston, America. At first the driver lets the radio take command and Pavarotti’s distinctive voice can be heard from within side the cab. At first the driver lets the radio play before he begins singing along to the Pavarotti song in perfect tune . He then begins singing along himself – loudly so that he is audible above the radio and the sounds of the road. While looking around as he drives, the Uber worker continues to sing along to the song both in tune and word perfectly. The song then concludes with the video maker saying: ‘Wow’ and the taxi driver falling silent as the outro music plays. The passenger filming then says: ‘Wow, that was brilliant. Thank you very much.’ He then asks whether the man was singing along to Pavarotti, to which the driver says yes. Reality is then restored as the passenger finishes praising the driver and instructs him to keep going straight. The passengers are amazed as they film the driver who sings along   to the opera song word perfectly . Later, the film maker wrote: ‘We were heading out to meet some friends at a party in South Boston and had a wonderful journey with the Uber Opera Man.’ Luciano Pavarotti was one of the most commercially successful tenors of all time and one of the Three Tenors. Gaining worldwide fame for the tone of his voice, Pavarotti made a number of televised concert performances. In 2007, the tenor died from pancreatic cancer."
"Days after a horrific Al-Shabaab attack on its soil, Kenya launched airstrikes targeting the terror group in Somalia, according to a military source, who insisted the strikes were not retribution for last week's massacre at Garissa University College that killed nearly 150 people. ""The latest attack of Al-Shabaab bases by the Kenya military is part of the ongoing operations that started in 2011. It is not a retaliation to the Garissa attack. The operation has been ongoing,"" the military source said Monday. It is customary for Kenyan military sources not to give their names to media. Two of the airstrikes hit Al-Shabaab training camps, according to a resident of the southwest Somalian town of Bardera, almost 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the Kenyan border, and a local journalist who asked not to be named out of fear for his safety. The Kenyan military began its bombing raids Sunday afternoon, targeting the Al-Shabaab stronghold of Godon Dhawe, Somali resident Ibrahim Mohammed said. Godon Dhawe is between Bardera and the Somalia-Kenya border. Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia, has claimed responsibility for the university attack. Also Monday, a police source said Kenyan authorities had intelligence beforehand that a university in Garissa could be attacked, yet the country's rapid response team was stuck in Nairobi for hours after the massacre began, arranging for transport. It's not clear exactly why the elite team was stuck in the Kenyan capital, roughly 370 kilometers (230 miles) west of the attack, but the police source in Garissa told CNN that Kenyan politicians and Nairobi-based journalists arrived on the scene before the team did. Journalists on the ground corroborated that report. Once the team entered the university complex, the situation was quickly defused, journalists and the police source said. Manoah Esipisu, a spokesman for Kenya's president and deputy president, defended the response time, telling CNN there is always criticism regarding whether ""you reacted as fast as you have or shouldn't have."" ""With the benefit of hindsight you can always say things could have been done better,"" he said, adding that Kenyan authorities saved a lot of students and ""got the job done."" Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed echoed those remarks in a Monday interview with CNN, saying the response was sufficient and denying reports that it was the elite rapid response team alone that brought an end to the situation. ""We have a military garrison in Garissa, and the work began immediately after the attack was reported and continued for a number of hours until we were able to rescue 663 students of the 800 students that had been taken hostage by these terrorists. So the response was adequate,"" she said. She repeated Esipisu's assertion that dubbing the response slow is a reaction that comes only with the luxury of hindsight. ""Obviously when parents are grieving and the country is mourning, it's always easy to fall back on things like that, but I can assure you that we took very quick action as soon as this was reported,"" Mohamed said. ""Obviously hindsight is always 20/20. We did everything that we could do."" The Kenyan government says Mohamed Mohamud is the mastermind of Thursday's terrorist attack on Garissa University College. The country's Interior Ministry singled out Mohamud, a senior leader of Al-Shabaab, on Twitter. He is also known by the aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere, it said. Mohamud is ""credited with having an extensive terrorist network within Kenya,"" according to a Kenyan ministry document given to CNN. The ministry posted a ""most wanted"" notice for Mohamud. It offers a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, about $215,000. ""We appeal to anyone with any info on #Gamadhere to share with relevant authorities and security agencies,"" the Interior Ministry posted on Twitter. Mohamud is in charge of external operations against Kenya, the document says, and he is the regional commander within Al-Shabaab in charge of the Juba region. In this role, he commands the militia along the border and ""is responsible for cross-border incursions in the country."" His position as one of Al-Shabaab's top field commanders in southern Somalia has brought him into direct conflict with Kenyan troops deployed as part of African Union forces in the country. ""This is a man who has a lot of grudges against the Kenyans,"" said Stig Jarle Hansen, an associate professor at Oslo's Norwegian University of Life Sciences and author of ""Al-Shabaab in Somalia: The History and Ideology of a Militant Islamist Group."" Mohamud's network extends within the Dadaab refugee camp, the document says. Dadaab is the world's biggest refugee camp, home to thousands of people, according to the United Nations. It's in Kenya's North Eastern Province near Somalia. Garissa, the town where the university attack took place, is about 150 kilometers (90 miles) from the Somali border. It's within ""striking distance"" of Mohamud's stronghold in Somalia's Middle Juba province, Hansen told CNN. But he noted that Mohamud is better known ""for tactical military attacks rather than terrorist attacks."" Inside Garissa University College dorm's scene of slaughter . Over the weekend, Al-Shabaab promised to bring about ""another bloodbath"" in Kenya. Though the terrorist group is based in Somalia, it hasn't confined its violence to the lawless nation. In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Mohamud has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the past few years, including December's attack on a quarry in a Kenyan village near the Somali border, which killed at least 36 people. In that attack, Al-Shabaab militants separated non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and killed them. Mohamud is Kenyan and has three wives and three siblings, including two with links to Al-Shabaab, the document says. He's from a clan, the Ogaden, that has a heavy presence in Kenya and Somalia, Hansen said. ""The borders historically have been meaningless to them,"" he said. CNN exclusive: Exposing smuggler routes across the Somalia-Kenya border . On Sunday, Kenya's Interior Ministry identified another terrorist involved in the Garissa University College attack as Abdirahim Abdullahi. Abdullahi's father, Abdullahi Daqare, a government chief in Mandera in northern Kenya, told CNN that his son was missing. Daqare is a Kenyan Somali, he said. His son graduated in 2013 from Nairobi University law school and worked for a bank for two months before he went missing, Daqare said in a phone interview. ""I have received reports from people who found information (on) the Internet that my son was one of the terrorists,"" Daqare said. ""I previously told the government that the son is missing. I sought their help to find the whereabouts of my son."" He added that the two had not been in contact since his son disappeared. Daqare said he had ""really given up on him."" On Sunday, families of some of the more than 147 people slain at Garissa University College left a mortuary in Nairobi after identifying the bodies of their loved ones. One woman almost had to be carried out. ""Why? Why? Where are you, my children?"" she wailed. Across Garissa, there was a sense of fear, foreboding and grief. The news agency Reuters videotaped a man holding his daughter's hand at a church as military patrols and security officials searched people. A church member told the agency, ""Nowhere is safe, but here in church you can come, you be with God and then you just console yourself."" Three days of national mourning for victims of the attack, declared by Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, began Sunday. CNN's Christian Purefoy and Lilian Leposo reported from Garissa; Eliott C. McLaughlin and Greg Botelho wrote from Atlanta; and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.

The four-time Olympic gold medal winner polled the most number of votes among the 542 members of the British team.
The 36-year-old cyclist also carried the Union Flag at the 2008 closing ceremony in Beijing.
""I'm absolutely delighted and honoured to have been voted as the flag bearer for Team GB,"" said Sir Chris.
""To lead out your team at a home Olympics is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity and one that that I can't wait to experience in just a few days time.""
Other Olympians who received support included archer Alison Williamson, who will compete in her sixth Games.
Hoy, who will compete in the team sprint and keirin at London 2012, is the first cyclist to have the honour of carrying the British flag at an opening ceremony.
The Scot will lead out Team GB when they become the last of the 204 competing nations to enter the arena.
Sir Chris Hoy was always one of the outstanding candidates for this role. His election was all but sealed when sailor Ben Ainslie, his main rival, was ruled out. Ainslie begins competing on Sunday, so will not attend the opening ceremony.
Sir Chris already has four Olympic gold medals and hopes to have increased that total to six by the end of the Games.
Hoy told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I'm still in shock, it's all sinking in. I'm just looking forward to Friday.
""To have the athletes vote for you it makes it even more special. This will be my first experience of an opening ceremony so for a number of reasons it will be very special.""
It has been a remarkable few days for British cycling following
Brian Cookson, president of British Cycling, told BBC Sport: ""Just when you think it can't get any better it does. It is the cherry on the cake for British Cycling after Bradley Wiggins's success on Sunday.
""Sir Chris is a brilliant athlete and a fantastic ambassador for the sport of cycling. Hoy is reaching his potential just at the right time in the sport and deserves this pivotal role at London 2012.""
Hoy, who is Scotland's most successful Olympian, was named BBC Sports Personality of the year in 2008.
He won a silver medal at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, a gold at Athens in 2004 and another three golds in Beijing four years ago.
Team GB's Chef de Mission Andy Hunt said: ""Team GB could not have placed the flag in better hands.
""It is a great honour for Sir Chris and the team will be proud to march behind him. He is a fantastic ambassador for his sport and his country.""
Hoy is not due to compete until the second week of the Games, when he will try to surpass rower Sir Steve Redgrave's British record of five gold medals.
The British Olympic Association asked each sport represented in Team GB to nominate one candidate. The team leaders of each sport then voted on the shortlist."
"John Carver says Newcastle’s hierarchy must try to bring an end to protests against the club after admitting it is affecting performances on the pitch. The Magpies slumped to a sixth straight defeat at home to Spurs last weekend amid an atmosphere of unrest after thousands of supporters boycotted the match in protest at a lack of ambition and investment from owner Mike Ashley. Fans group AshleyOut.com are now encouraging supporters to ‘Stand Up To Ashley’ when Swansea visit St James’ Park on Saturday. This will involve a 34th-minute protest in recognition of the £34million which was last week revealed to be sitting in the club’s bank. Newcastle interim manager John Carver has called for unity at the club following a divisive season . Carver has said he is not afraid about giving his honest opinion on events at St James' Park . And Carver said: ‘We have to find a way of dealing with it and managing the situation because it can only hurt us – that is the fans and the club. ‘We need to find a solution. I don’t know what that is and I haven’t had talks about it, but if I get asked my opinion then I would give an honest answer. ‘It would be fantastic (if this was resolved ahead of next season). From day one it would be better. That is what we need to do.’ Carver, meanwhile, says his players were affected by the protest during the 3-1 loss against Spurs. ‘When I came away from the game I thought about it and the people who were in the stadium weren’t quite sure how to react. Some of them were annoyed that people had stayed away, others were delighted. It was strange,’ he said. ‘When it all kicked off last year you knew where you stood. This wasn’t a nice situation to be in, it was uncomfortable. ‘There was a lot of apprehension around the place on Sunday. I hear there was anger with each other and people falling out with each other in the stands. That cannot help, surely not. ‘I thought it didn’t affect us during the game, but on reflection I think it did.’ Carver – who is likely to be replaced by Steve McClaren in the summer - says he has not been told if he will still have a role at the club next season. Newcastle United fans have planned a mass protest against owner Mike Ashley on Saturday afternoon . At least 10,000 supporters stayed away from St James' Park for the club's last home game against Spurs . However, he hopes that the club make a swift announcement on the future of the managerial position. ‘That would be for everyone’s benefit,’ said Carver when asked if the week after the season’s end was the best time to resolve the current uncertainty. ‘The fans, myself, everyone could enjoy their summer. I think it will be (sorted quickly) because don’t forget the window opens very soon after the season finishes. It has to be done and your recruitment has to be done in that period of time.’ He added: ‘I don’t know (if it will be me). I think people understand the situation I’m in and know what I’m trying to do. ‘Only they (hierarchy) know. But every time I get together with them they are positive – whether that’s to keep me going or they have someone else lined up, I don’t know. ‘That doesn’t affect me, the future will take care of itself. I’m just concentrating on now.’ The supporters' group have asked fans to stand in the 34th minute of Saturday's  match against Swansea . Fans boycotting the Spurs match hold banners demanding the resignation of Ashley as Newcastle director . Newcastle supporters have also been asked to take part in peaceful protests outside Sports Direct stores ."

Jeff Owens, Delphi's chief technology officer, sees the automated driver assistance systems in the Audi as building blocks on the road to fully self-driving cars in the next decade. The Delphi drivebegan  March 22 near San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, with plans to wind up in New York City just before the annual auto show opens there on April 3. During the coast-to-coast journey in the Audi, at least two Delphi engineers will be aboard, including one behind the wheel. Delphi, a former General Motors Co unit domiciled in the UK, will test such functions as traffic jam assist, automated highway pilot with lane change and automated parking and valet. All of those systems are expected to be introduced in production cars over the next two to three years. Although automakers and suppliers will have such capability within the next five years, Owens said, 'our view is that the driver is going to be in the seat for a long time' in case of emergency situations that self-driving systems may not be equipped or programmed to handle. During the coast-to-coast journey in the Audi, at least two Delphi engineers will be aboard, including one behind the wheel. Delphi, a former General Motors Co unit domiciled in the UK, will test such functions as traffic jam assist, automated highway pilot with lane change and automated parking and valet. All of those systems are expected to be introduced in production cars over the next two to three years. Fully automated systems that may be phased in after 2020 could add about $5,000 to the cost of a car, estimates Glen De Vos, vice president of advanced and product engineering for Delphi's electronics and safety division. Delphi is providing some of the components and technology, including vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity, for GM's Super Cruise automated driving system, which will debut in 2016 on the new Cadillac CT6 sedan. During the cross-country trek, the vehicle will be challenged under a variety of driving conditions from changing weather and terrain to potential road hazards -- things that could never truly be tested in a lab. 'Delphi had great success testing its car in California and on the streets of Las Vegas,' said Owens. 'Now it's time to put our vehicle to the ultimate test by broadening the range of driving conditions. 'This drive will help us collect invaluable data in our quest to deliver the best automotive grade technologies on the market.'"
"It could be the result of jetlag, or maybe a few too many beers. As passengers waited to collect their luggage from the baggage reclaim, they were in for a shock when they discovered a man asleep on the conveyor. The incredible footage was shot at Domodedovo Airport in Russia, and shows a man lying in the foetal position seemingly away with the fairies. A man decided to have a snooze on the airport baggage reclaim, not looking too comfortable . While the rubber may well be more comfortable than the airport floor, the swinging motion of the conveyor make it a less-than comfortable snooze. Incredibly, other passengers appear more concerned with spotting their luggage than the fate of the dozing man in shorts. It's not the first instance where passengers have decided to relax on the baggage reclaim. An inebriated Chinese passenger wandered into a train station in his home country and fell asleep on the luggage belt. While some passengers appeared amused by the sleeping man, most were focused on claiming their luggage . When the machine started working, the man was taken through the X-ray scanner. Officials at the station decided to release the images as a warning to others not to do similar. And staff at Rome’s Fiumicino Airport spotted a man curled up on the conveyor after a 55-yard free ride. The Norwegian was believed to be under the influence of alcohol, and had clambered over a check-in desk to grab some rest. The incident brought smiles from those waiting for luggage, while the passenger circled around ."
"Enforcement company Kingdom Services hands out on the spot fines.
Ashford Borough Council removed all its Kingdom officers from patrolling the streets, after one was filmed revealing he raked in a bonus of almost £1,000.
They will be out of action while undergoing extra training.
A spokeswoman for the council said: ""In light of the recent Panorama programme we have decided to take this opportunity to give our wardens some important additional staff training exercises so they can continue operating fairly and effectively.
""We haven't suspended them but they are not patrolling currently. They should be back soon, after the training has been undertaken.""
Littering is a crime, but by paying the fine you can avoid a criminal record. Another Kent-based Kingdom trainer was caught on camera saying they pretend to call the police to pressure people to pay up.
The BBC1 programme, aired on Monday, revealed people across the country were wrongly fined for tipping coffee down a drain and putting their recycling out on the wrong day.
On Tuesday Maidstone Borough Council also removed its own Kingdom officers while a review was carried out. They were back patrolling on Wednesday.
It is not the first time councils in Kent have had problems with Kingdom.
Maidstone suspended its officers last year for a two-week review after a woman was incorrectly fined for littering while feeding some ducks.
Gravesham Borough Council severed ties with Kingdom last year and now operates its litter enforcement ""in-house"".
A spokesman for Kingdom said: ""Our service operates under some of the tightest legal guidelines which set the fixed penalty notice level and affords anybody the right to appeal to the council or/and challenge with the courts if they choose."""
"""No-one will face a cliff edge,"" Theresa May said at a Brussels summit.
A new ""UK settled status"" will grant those who have spent five years in the UK equal rights on healthcare, education, benefits and pensions.
Guaranteeing EU citizens' rights is the top priority for the EU delegation negotiating Brexit.
Before Mrs May's offer, the EU proposed that EU citizens in the UK and the estimated 1.2 million Britons living in EU countries should continue enjoying the same rights, enforceable by the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
There are two other thorny issues that have to be resolved early on - the UK's divorce bill and the Northern Ireland border.
An estimated 3.2 million EU citizens live in the UK and there is much nervousness - some even fear deportation.
Mrs May sought to reassure the UK's 27 EU partners, saying the UK ""does not want anyone here to have to leave, nor does it want families to be split up"".
Her Brexit statement took up little of the summit's time. There was no debate as the EU is anxious to avoid any splits emerging.
The UK election left Mrs May seriously weakened, heading a minority government, which has fuelled uncertainty about the whole Brexit process.
The UK's exit deadline is 30 March 2019. A cut-off date for obtaining ""UK settled status"" is yet to be announced.
EU citizens who settle in the UK before Brexit will get a grace period to reach the five-year minimum for residency - but only if they arrive before the cut-off date.
There are categories of people whose status may remain unclear, such as children, carers, students and Irish citizens. Ireland has a special relationship with the UK, including a Common Travel Area.
The UK is anxious to start negotiating a new trade deal soon, but the EU has already won the argument that its Brexit priorities must be addressed first.
As the summit got under way, European Council President Donald Tusk emphasised that the door to the UK staying in the EU was still open. Quoting John Lennon's Imagine, he said: ""You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.""
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that as an Anglophile, ""I hate Brexit from every angle.""
""It is crucially important we know what Britain wants from Brexit,"" he warned. The Netherlands is one of the UK's closest EU allies, with a similar stance on free trade.
Mrs May has vowed to take the UK out of both the EU single market and the customs union. But there are many voices - including in her Conservative Party - pressing for a softer approach.
""I hope we'll come to some form of continued [UK] membership or relationship with the internal market,"" Mr Rutte said. ""I absolutely believe the UK will be hit in the economy and the pound very hard.""
Counter-terrorism has also been a key issue at the summit which comes in the wake of an attack in Brussels on Tuesday.
Several EU states have been attacked in recent weeks, including the UK, France and Sweden, and Mrs May said that an attack against any member state was an attack on all.
The 28 leaders agreed to put legal pressure on internet giants like Google, Twitter and Facebook to remove jihadist content faster and more proactively.
Mr Tusk said the bloc was calling on social media companies to do whatever was necessary to prevent the spread of terrorist material and was prepared to pass new legislation. ""This means developing new tools to detect and remove material automatically,"" he said.
The EU wants the industry to help tackle the problem of attackers slipping under the radar by using apps with end-to-end encryption."
"For eight weeks, the sight of a shirtless Aidan Turner swinging scythes and standing up to the nefarious Warleggans has been getting the nation hot under the collar. Now, less than 12 hours after Poldark ended with a dramatic cliffhanger, disgruntled viewers have taken to Twitter to complain of 'withdrawal symptoms' - and  urge the BBC to hurry up with series two. 'As if the Sherlock hiatus wasn't bad enough... experiencing #Poldark withdrawal symptoms already,' tweeted fan Mihaela Doaga within minutes of the closing credits. Scroll down for video . To be continued... Poldark ended last night on a dramatic cliff-hanger with the main man hauled off to jail . 'Ahhhh #Poldark, I'm not OK!,' wrote another, adding 'T'int right, t'int fair, t'int proper' - a reference to the catchphrase memorably deployed by Poldark's malingering servant, Judd. Others complained of having their Monday morning blues made worse by waking up to the prospect of going months before seeing Mr Turner, 31, and his famous abs on screen once more. 'The morning after #Poldark ends and amazingly, the sun has managed to rise in the sky,' wrote Turner fan AM Scanlon. 'Have a good week everyone, or as good as it can be.' Another, Luci Gosling, added: 'Waking up to a week with no #Poldark to look forward to. Gawd, life is tough.' Bereft: Poldark fans such as Suze Smith took to Twitter to complain about the show ending . Missing out: Fans say they have nothing to look forward to now the show is over . Not quite true: Poldark will be replaced in the schedules with Sheridan Smith drama, The C-Word . Painful: Others said they were experiencing withdrawal symptoms less than 12 hours after the finale . The drama has proved one of the most successful of 2015 so far, pulling in an average of 5.9 million viewers per episode and a massive 6.1 million for last night's finale. Much of that is due to Mr Turner and his smouldering looks which, combined with regular shirtless scenes, have produced a collective swoon among female viewers. But it hasn't all been plain sailing for the drama, which has been renewed and will start filming again this autumn. Poldark's famous scything scenes have sparked complaints from professional mowers who say Turner's scything techniques aren't up to scratch. 'The story of Poldark highlights the romantic aspect of the scythe and its use in history but we weren’t very impressed with Aidan Turner’s scything,' said expert mower Chris Riley, 56, last week. Next year: With filming on season two of Poldark due to start filming this autumn, fans are in for a long wait . Popular: Aidan Turner and his famous abs have been the highlight of the show for many women . 'There was a lot of sweating and grunting going on but the only time you’d mow like that would be in a competition.' At the end of March, an #AskPoldark wheeze launched by the BBC's social media team also descended into farce after viewers bombarded Mr Turner with indecent proposals. 'How do you ever stop looking in the mirror?' asked one fan. Another added: 'My mower has packed in - would you come round and scythe my lawn please?' Although the 31-year-old made a stab at answering many of the questions, he left the more risqué queries go unanswered. While the second series of Poldark isn't due to air until 2016,  Mr Turner's legion of fans can take some consolation from The Secret Scripture, an upcoming thriller in which the Irish actor stars. Scheduled for release later this year, it co-stars Melbourne-born actor Eric Bana, 46, The Social Network star Rooney Mara, 30,  and veteran actress Vanessa Redgrave, 78. Got withdrawal symptoms? Meet the hunks set to light up the big and small screens this summer . Poldark might be no more, for this year at least, but there's no shortage of cinematic and small screen crumpet, much of it shirtless, around this summer. Along with Mr Turner's upcoming role in The Secret Scripture, Clint Eastwood's handsome 29-year-old son Scott will please the ladies during his shirt-free scenes in new film, The Longest Ride. Like father, like son! Clint Eastwood's son Scott will be shirtless in cinemas from this June . Magic Mike: Channing Tatum and the strippers will be back in July with Magic Mike XXL . The film, which gets its UK release in June, co-stars Britt Robertson and tells the story of a former champion bull rider and his quest for love. Less romantic but with a whole lot of pecs appeal is the second instalment of Magic Mike; the Channing Tatum film about the exploits of a troupe of male strippers. Entitled Magic Mike XXL, it opens on the 4th July and along with 35-year-old Tatum, also features the Poldark-esque Joe Manganiello, 38. Also on the way is Southpaw, a boxing film starring a bulked-up Jake Gyllenhaal, and the remake of National Lampoon’s Vacation which features Australian muscleman, Chris Hemsworth, 31. Beefy: A bulked-up Jake Gyllenhaal will be appearing in boxing film Southpaw from the end of July . Lots to see: Chris Hemsworth, seen here in a Saturday Night Live skit, will appear in National Lampoon's Vacation and is currently starring in superhero flick, Avengers: Age of Ultron as Norse god Thor . Razor cheekbones: 29-year-old Tom Hughes will be appearing in The Game on BBC2 from this Thursday . Should the 31st July not be soon enough, Mr Hemsworth is currently reprising his role as Norse god Thor in superhero action-fest, Avengers: Age of Ultron. The small screen also has plenty to recommend it, beginning with new BBC2 spy thriller The Game which starts on Thursday and stars the razor-cheekboned Tom Hughes, 29. Season two of Vikings, starring another handsome blonde Australian in the shape of 35-year-old Travis Fimmel, is currently underway on History while those with Amazon Prime can enjoy the sight of Sam Heughan, 34, flexing his muscles on Outlander. Game of Thrones also has a pleasingly high muscle count, with Michiel Huisman (Daario Naharis) and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister) among the hunks worth switching on for. Smouldering: Sam Heughan, 34, has been winning over viewers with his performance in Outlander . Handsome: Travis Fimmel is seen here making the Dark Ages look appealing in History's Vikings . Good look: Dutch actor Michiel Huisman (Daario Naharis) shows off his rippling abs in Game of Thrones ."
"A victim is taking legal action to force an independent inquiry with power to compel witnesses and the security services to hand over documents.
Gary Hoy was abused by two men who were subsequently convicted.
There have been allegations that a paedophile ring at Kincora was linked to the British intelligence services.
The government has so far refused calls for the abuse scandal at the Belfast home to be included within the scope of the inquiry established by Home Secretary Theresa May and headed by New Zealand judge Lowell Goddard.
The government has said that as child protection is a devolved matter, the right place for the Kincora allegations to be examined is Northern Ireland's Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry, which has been sitting in Banbridge.
The victims of Kincora claim the Northern Ireland inquiry lacks the powers to compel evidence or witnesses from government agencies.
Amnesty International, which is supporting the victims' legal challenge, says two military intelligence officers have alleged that the security services blocked police investigations into the child abuse at Kincora in the 1970s.
The judicial review is expected to last several days.
Three senior care staff at Kincora were jailed in 1981 for abusing 11 boys.
At least 29 boys were abused at the home between the late 1950s and the early 1980s.
One of the men who was later convicted, William McGrath, is believed to have been an MI5 agent."
"Former Dragons’ Den star Duncan Bannatyne this morning announced he would back Labour at the next election – just a week after backing the Tories. The millionaire businessman said Ed Miliband’s plan to scrap the controversial ‘non-dom’ status had won him over. He tweeted: 'Ed Milliband says he will abolish non-dom status in UK. This gets my vote I never thought any party would have courage to do this.' Scroll down for video . Duncan Bannatyne said Ed Miliband’s plan to scrap the controversial ‘non-dom’ status had won him over . It comes after the hotelier signed a letter from more than 100 business leaders backing the Tories’ economic record. The letter claimed that the 'Conservative-led Government has been good for business' and backed the cut in corporation tax to 20 per cent. Mr Bannatyne’s inclusion on the list was deeply damaging for Labour – having previously been one of the party’s most high profile backers. The TV star helped unveil a 'seaside manifesto' with Gordon Brown before the 2010 general election. But he announced this morning that Mr Miliband’s planned raid on the super-rich – announced this morning – has convinced him to return. Speaking in Coventry this morning, the Labour leader promised that the 200-year-old rule for non-doms, which applies to around 116,000 people, makes Britain an 'offshore tax haven for a few' and can 'no longer be justified'. Former Dragons’ Den star Duncan Bannatyne this morning announced he would back Labour at the next election – just a week after backing the Tories . Speaking in Coventry this morning, Labour leader Ed Miliband claimed the 200-year-old 'non dom' rule makes Britain an 'offshore tax haven for a few' and can 'no longer be justified' The Tories warned the plan could cost Britain 'hundreds of millions of pounds' and stopped short of scrapping the rules, despite Labour's claims. Non-domicile status allows people living and working in Britain to only pay tax on their UK income, but not earnings from overseas. They must prove that they regard a foreign country as their real home. But Mr Miliband said that non-dom tests 'are not very rigorous' and can be granted to people who have a burial plot or property abroad. Mr Miliband said everyone who has made Britain their permanent home should pay full UK tax on all their income and gains. He will pledge to abolish the non-dom status from April 2016. The status, which is unique to the UK having been introduced by William Pitt the Younger in the late 18th century, is used by more than 110,000 wealthy people. Mr Bannatyne was one of the former Prime Minister Gordon Brown's most prominent backers - and was wheeled out ahead of the 2010 election (above) to boost the party's business credentials . Mr Miliband said non-dom status results from a discredited belief that 'anything goes for those at the top and that what is good for the rich is always good for Britain'. He said: 'There are people who live here in Britain like you and me, work here in Britain, are permanently settled here in Britain like you and me, but aren't required to pay taxes like you and me because they take advantage of what has become an increasingly arcane 200-year-old loophole. 'There are now 116,000 non-doms, costing hundreds of millions of pounds to our country – it can no longer be justified, and it makes Britain an offshore tax haven for a few.' Non-dom status is often inherited through the father so can apply to people who were born in Britain. David Cameron - in Cornwall with his wife Samantha last night - has been accused of defending special rules for the rich . They must pay an annual fee, of up to £90,000, to take advantage of the rules, which means it is only of us to the very wealthy. Newspaper reports overnight suggested that non-dom rules would be scrapped by Labour altogether. But today it emerged Labour would allow 'real temporary residents' to take advantage of the rules - with the time limit to be consulted on should they take power in the General Election on May 7. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said it should be around two or three years - not the five suggested in some reports. But it emerged that when he was a Treasury minister in the last Labour government, Mr Balls insisted that 'the majority of non-domiciled individuals who had already left the UK spent no more than five years here'. Chancellor George Osborne said Labour's proposals amounted to 'tinkering around the edges' not an outright ban. 'Either they are going to abolish non-dom status altogether which would cost our country hundreds of millions of pounds in lost tax revenues and lost investment - the reason they did nothing on this during 13 years in office,' Mr Osborne said. 'Or they are just tinkering around the edges and making small adjustments to the rules on how long people can be non-dom. 'This confusion is another reminder of why they can't be trusted with our economy.' The Lib Dems said the number non-dom numbers 'exploded' under the last Labour government and more than doubled while Mr Miliband was an adviser in the Treasury. Mr Balls told BBC Radio 4's Today that circumstances had changed and there was now a large budget deficit to cut. 'People were saying in the middle of the last decade this will lead to people leaving the country. It's not actually turned out to be the case,' he said. 'The abuse is bigger than we thought. These rules are ridiculous, they are unfair, they are being abused, and I think it's time to act. 'These were introduced in the period of the Napoleonic wars to allow people who were earning money in the colonies not to pay tax in the UK. 'That's fine, it's a different world now, a different time, different choices.'"
"It seems almost silly to be writing about baseball in the context of recent events.  Except it isn't. Last weekend, as Baltimore reacted to the death of Freddie Gray, the young man who died last week from a spinal cord injury he suffered while in police custody, Major League Baseball had a problem on its hands. Saturday's game between the Orioles and Red Sox had gone into extra innings in Camden Yards, with plenty of fans for both teams glued to their seats. Boston fans feel at home in Oriole Park -- a so-called retro urban park built to embrace the luxuries of modern stadiums while maintaining that nostalgic feel -- because much of it was based on Boston's Fenway Park. The Boston faithful are used to being in the heart of a city to watch sports.  But when the Orioles finally pulled out a win in the 10th inning, 36,000 fans remained in their seats. They had been asked to do so by Baltimore officials due to  ""ongoing public safety issues."" The riots of Baltimore, the peaceful marches of Baltimore, the fury and unrest of Baltimore did not seem to have had much to do with baseball.  But as the always-wise Atlantic magazine writer (and Baltimore native) Ta-Nehisi Coates' take on the situation quickly went viral, it became clear that the Oriole's home stand presented a problem. Monday's game against the Chicago White Sox: postponed less than an hour before the first pitch. Tuesday's game against the White Sox: also postponed. Such action by MLB is not without precedent.  In 1967 in Detroit, the 12th Street riots forced the Tigers to postpone one game and relocate others (to Baltimore, no less).  After the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., MLB postponed opening day games out of fear of mob violence.  In the wake of the 1992 verdict in the Rodney King beating, the Los Angeles Dodgers postponed several games.  The entire league went on hiatus in the wake of the terrorism and violence of September 11, 2001. Politics threaten sports all the time.  From the demonstrations against the Brazilian government before last summer's World Cup to the massacre of protesting students days before the Opening Ceremony of the Mexico City Olympics in 1968, sports knows well that it sits within the larger context of the world. Our deep investment in our teams -- beyond the tax dollars that construct the stadiums and the salaries players make (and the profits the owners and sponsors draw) -- is supposed to work to create community, to unify.  Cheering for the home team is supposed to create a sense of belonging. ""It's interesting that I have not yet heard anyone say that baseball or sport can heal this wound,""  Daniel Nathan, professor of American Studies at Skidmore College and editor of ""Rooting for the Home Team: Sport, Community and Identity"" told me.  ""People did say that in the weeks after 9/11.  This is not 9/11 -- not even close.  But it is a serious social and cultural rupture. Painful."" What happens next is striking.  After two postponements, the Orioles will play Chicago on Wednesday, but no one else will be invited.  In an unprecedented move by major league baseball, the public is not invited to the final game of the series, moved to the afternoon in accordance with the curfew imposed by Baltimore's mayor. While there are a few examples of fan-less games being played in the United States, none have been for such reasons, while in Europe, there have been a handful of incidents in which soccer teams have been punished for fan behavior with fan-less games. Without fans, does baseball mean anything? When the new Camden Yards made its debut in 1992, people heralded the return of the old-time stadium smack in the middle of the city.  But are the residents of that city ready to reminisce about the so-called good old days? In a recent episode of ""Real Sports,"" Chris Rock delivered a brilliant seven-minute diatribe on the fact that less than 10% of baseball players or fans are black. ""Last year, the San Francisco Giants won it all without any black guys on the team,"" he said. ""The team the Giants had to beat to get there, the St. Louis Cardinals, had no black people. None. How could you ever be in St. Louis and see no black people?"" Rock's thesis?  That baseball's sense of nostalgia encompassed by places like Camden Yards does not sit well with African Americans, whose memories of the old days are anything but good. To his credit, Orioles Executive Vice President John Angelos, son of majority owner Peter Angelos, took to Twitter to prioritize the issues at hand, focusing not on the lost games, but on the ""unfairly impoverished population living under an ever-declining standard of living and suffering at the butt end of an ever-more militarized and aggressive surveillance state."" Yet as much of America continues to grapple with the idea that black lives matter, it is clear that the country believes sports do matter, whether or not anyone is there to watch. And with MLB's announcement that Baltimore's weekend games will be moved to Tampa, it becomes clear that the only thing that the United States has figured out about race relations, poverty, the achievement gap, police brutality, and so on is how to keep its baseball players safe and make sure that the games go on."

"Using similar technology to face and fingerprint recognition software, the computers have been taught to recognise cells and pinpoint them.
It means cancer cells can be identified quicker, speeding up diagnosis times.
The project is in collaboration with specialists in the US, Germany, London and Newcastle.
Prof Paul Rees, from the university's college of engineering, said in the past, finding cancer cells had been like ""looking for a needle in a haystack"" and the new method was a ""world-leading development"".
""The researchers train the algorithm to recognise the specific cell of interest by giving examples of the cell to be identified,"" he said.
""After learning what the cells look like, the computer algorithms can then identify the target cells in a population of previously unseen cells.""
As well as making the cells easier to find, the new method can also determine a cell's age, which Prof Rees said was important because most treatments act on cells at a certain point within their lifecycle.
Researchers at Harvard University in the US, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen in Munich, Germany, The Francis Crick Institute in London and Newcastle Upon Tyne University have also been involved in the project.
""These institutes are working at the cutting edge of the fight against cancer and they are very eager to have these types of tools,"" Prof Rees said.
""This development is very important for Wales - it shows that we are a player on the international stage.""
Prof Dr Fabian Theis, of the Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, added the team's work could ""open up a whole new perspective that could also be used for entirely different research questions, not only for cell analysis""."
"On March 20, 2013, a cyberattack brought chaos to several banks and media outlets in South Korea. Then more ominously on December 23 last year, computers at the country's nuclear operator were breached.  Again cybercrime was suspected. The source of these attacks? North Korea. And South Korean investigators say they have proof -- the actual malicious codes used in the attacks. They shared this data with CNN. The 2013 attack, known as ""Dark Seoul,"" paralyzed an estimated 48,000 computers at a number of major banks and broadcasters, disrupting network systems and wiping their hard disks clean. ""It would try to delete essentially all your files... then restart the system. You would come back up and nothing would be there,"" Joshua James, a digital forensic expert, told CNN. ""If it infected more financial systems, it could have deleted all financial data in Korea. I mean, it is dangerous,"" the visiting professor at Chuncheon's Hallym University added. Live footage of the breaches showed computer screens at the media companies completely down, while bank customers were unable to make withdrawals, or transfer money online. ""Dark Seoul"" happened shortly after the North Korean government announced it would end the armistice agreement that brought the three-year Korean War to an end in July 1953 amid growing tensions with its neighbor. The latest high-profile digital incursion, in December, attempted to steal data from South Korea's nuclear operator, including plant blueprints and personnel information. Though investigators said no critical data was stolen, the attack raised serious concerns about the safety and security of the 23 nuclear power plants it runs. The attack itself was described by James as a ""spear-fishing"" exercise where unsuspecting victims -- retired and current employees of the nuclear operator -- were prompted to open up a disguised document in their email. ""As soon as you double click on it, it starts running in the background of your computer where you can't see ... it's also trying to open up your computer -- what we call a back door -- to give access to the infected system by the attacker,"" he told CNN. The attack, which James said was simpler than ""Dark Seoul,"" came just a few days after Sony Pictures said their systems has been ""hacked,"" another attack the South Korean authorities blamed on North Korea. ""From a law enforcement or investigation side, we're trying to actually trace back to who did it,"" said James. Seoul announced in mid-March that some of the IP addresses used in December incursion could be traced back to Shenyang, China, which can be easily accessed from the North Korean border. Codes used in the attack were said to be similar in pattern to those used by the North Koreans, South Korean authorities said. ""The malicious codes used in the attack were same in composition and working methods as ""Kimsuky"" codes known to be used by North Korea,"" the prosecutor's office that leads 17 other government agencies and Internet companies in the investigation said in the statement in March. Pyongyang has dismissed the claims it launched these attacks, calling them a ""plot and fabrication that can never win over the truth."" But many experts say North Korea appears to be investing more in cyberwarfare because it is cheaper than spending on conventional weapons and can cause significant economic damage to its southern rival. Indeed South Korea's Defense Ministry estimates that North Korea is operating a ""cyberarmy"" of 6,000 workers as it focuses on strengthening its asymmetrical warfare capability. ""Hacks are going on all the time, constantly -- though how many actually make the news is a very small amount,"" said James. ""How many are detected in general? I think the average person would have no clue they've been hacked. ""Organizations need to invest the same amount that hackers are investing to protect themselves and right now they're not,"" he added. Many in South Korea believe not enough effort is being put into defending against cyberattacks. A report by the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade, a government-funded think tank, estimates that ""Dark Seoul"" caused about $820 million worth of damage. Its report, published in 2014, predicted that by 2020, South Korea could be exposed to hacking attacks causing up to $25 billion in economic damage."

"There’s nothing better than a succulent steak, sizzling from the hot plate, charred to perfection on the outside, bursting with juices within. People often get it wrong when  cooking this cut of meat and end up with an overdone dish that’s bone dry, grey-hued and distinctly unappetising. So what is the best way to cook the perfect steak? Do you season before or after? Oil the pan or the meat? And what are the best cuts? Scroll down for video . Speak to your butcher when you're shopping for a perfect steak and pay a little bit extra for the best meat . Allow your meat to come to room temperature before you start cooking, Mr McCarroll advised . According to Jared McCarroll head chef at M Restaurant and Grill, the first step to a perfect steak starts when you are shopping; when buying steaks purchase the best meat you can afford. He told Femail: ‘It’s best to speak to your local butcher and pay a little bit extra and reap the rewards when eating it.’ And while we all stress about the cooking times for steak, he advises in checking the temperature of the meat before you start preparing your meal. 'One of the most important steps in cooking the perfect steak that is often forgotten or never thought about, is to allow your meat to come to room temperature first. 'This will shorten the cooking time and help to prevent grey rings from happening,' Mr McCarroll continued. Your steak should have a fine texture, be well marbled (veins of fat running through the meat) and firm to the touch. The shape and thickness of the steak is also important; the best steaks are one to 1.5-inches thick as a thinner cut is likely to get dry quicker. ‘The texture will depend on the quality of the beef and the cut; fillet has the best texture but the least flavour, whereas ribeye has more flavour and more fat, less texture but more flavour,' the chef said. ‘When it comes to the shape of the steak, try and keep it flat and a decent thickness. ‘Too thin a steak will be easy to overcook. Also try to keep the shape the same throughout the whole steak as this will help to keep the cooking consistent. A rib-eye (pictured) has more fat and more flavour but less texture . Some people like theirs blue while others don’t want to see any pink in their meat. But what are the perfect timings to cook steak the way you like it? If you are unsure, it's best to speak to your butcher as they will be able to give you the best advice based on the thickness and cut of meat. The cooking times below are for a 2cm thick sirloin steak . Blue: 1 minute each side. The steak should be just warm and fell spongy under your fingertips. Meat should still be dark in colour . Rare: 1.5 minutes per side. Dark red with some juice. There will be some resistance when you press the meat but it should still feel soft and bouncy . Medium rare:  2 minutes per side. Pink meat with pink juice. Springy, soft and spongy. Medium: 2.5  mins per side. Your meat will be mostly cooked with only pink in the middle. The steak will feel firm. Well-done: 4 to 5 minutes. There will be hardly any pink and the meat should have a bouncy, firm feel. But which cuts are the best? Or do they all have their own strengths? 'The cut depends on individual preference,' he said. 'The most important thing is to look out for marbling. Marbling is a great way to tell the quality of the meat. The more marbling a piece of steak has means the more moist it will be. Marbling means your steak is full of mono saturated fatty acid, proven to reduce cholesterol levels. It also has a low melting point, thus giving you the melt-in-the-mouth effect. When seasoning, Mr McCarroll advises using coarse salt. ‘When seasoning the beef, I would place the beef on the grill and season the top with a coarse salt; either rock salt or Maldon is good. ‘The steak will absorb the salt and when you flip it the excess salt will fall off, which means you can season the other side. Cook your steak on a grill and only flip it over once, he said. 'For me the best way to cook a steak is straight on the grill. Charcoal and wood will give you the most flavour and smokiness but if you have a gas BBQ that will do as well. 'Ideally you should only flip your steak once,' he continued. And while we’ve all been told various cooking times for the perfect steak, Mr McCarroll says there are too many variables to have anything set in stone. ‘Cooking times will vary depending on the size of the steak, whether it is room temperature, how hot your grill is. 'There are too many variables to give a specific cooking time,’ he said. The T-Bone (left) gets its name from the distinctive T-shaped bone. Filet mignons are prized for their tender meat although they are the least flavourful cuts . T-Bone: This cut gets its name from its distinctive T-shaped bone T-shaped bone. A succulent piece of meat which is both a strip sirloin (bone in) and a tender filet mignon. Also known as: Short loin, porterhouse, club steak . Filet mignon: A cut taken from the heart of the beef tenderloin. Known for it’s tenderness and texture but is not the most flavourful cut. Also known as tenderloin, tournedos, cheauteubriand, beef medallion . A New York Strip has good marbling and a strong flavour. Top Sirloin comes from the rump and is tougher . New York Strip: A cut taken from towards the rear-end of the steer from just behind the ribs, this has good marbling and strong beefy flavour. An excellent cut for grilling as it has less fat. Also known as: Strip Lon, Shell Steak, Kansas City Strip, New York Strip Steak . Top Sirloin: Sirloin meat is near the rump so this might take some chewing as its much tougher than meat taken from the loin or ribs. The top sirloin however is taken from the tender centre of the sirloin. Grilling it quickly will bring out its flavours best. New York Strip: A cut taken from towards the rear-end of the steer from just behind the ribs, this has good marbling and strong beefy flavour. An excellent cut for grilling as it has less fat. Also known as: Strip Loin, Shell Steak, Kansas City Strip, New York Strip Steak . The classic rib eye is a well-marbled piece of meat. The porterhouse is a combination of two cuts of steak . Rib eye: A classic cut, rib-eye steaks are usually well-marbled which make them one of the juiciest, melt-in-the-mouth steaks. Fat is what gives this steak its flavour . Also known as: Scotch fillet, Delmonico steak . Porterhouse: A combination of two cuts, the porterhouse is a very large steak comprised of A New York strip on one side and a tender filet on the other. Also known as: T-Bone, Short Loin."
"Recently, Robert Kennedy Jr. was in Sacramento, California, to campaign against Senate Bill 227, which makes it harder for parents to opt out of vaccinations. In his remarks at an anti-vaccination movie screening, he decided to compare ""vaccine-induced"" autism to the Holocaust. He said, ""They get the shot, that night they have a fever of a hundred and three, they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone,"" Kennedy said. ""This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country."" A few days later, he apologized to people who were outraged on behalf of the memory of the Holocaust. To many, it's sacrilege to compare any lesser issue to the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis. In a statement, Kennedy said, ""I want to apologize to all whom I offended by my use of the word to describe the autism epidemic. I employed the term during an impromptu speech as I struggled to find an expression to convey the catastrophic tragedy of autism, which has now destroyed the lives of over 20 million children and shattered their families."" Robert Kennedy Jr. has apologized for the wrong things. First and foremost, vaccines do not cause autism. The two have nothing to do with each other. Second, he seems to think people with autism are ""gone,"" their lives ""destroyed"" and their families ""shattered."" Autism is not a death sentence. People with autism are not missing or destroyed. They are everywhere, trying to live their lives in a society that too often demeans them as subhuman, missing or worthless. Kennedy's rhetoric is a problem, even beyond the fraudulent basis for his claims about vaccines. People who believe autism is an environmental disease try to cure kids with quack treatments like giving them bleach-based enemas. Others, believing autism functions as a death sentence, even kill their children. I am worried about the effect of having such a powerful, high-profile member of our political class endorse this demeaning depiction of life with autism. I reached out to a number of autistic activists for comment. Ari Ne'eman, president of the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network, wrote, ""Robert Kennedy Jr, who has engaged with autism only to spread lies, misinformation and dehumanizing rhetoric, has never meaningfully engaged in efforts to improve the lives of autistic Americans. While his father, uncle and many others in the Kennedy-Shriver family championed the rights of people with disabilities, he has instead cast his lot with those who use pseudo-science to question our humanity."" These are harsh words, but try to see the situation through Ne'eman's eyes. Not only is Kennedy perpetuating a discredited theory, but he's also suggesting that it's better to let your children get preventable and sometimes fatal diseases than risk becoming autistic. The usual response to people like Ne'eman is that he is ""high functioning,"" but what of the burden to families who are struggling to care for less able individuals? Henry Frost, an autistic teenager and writer, is devastated by this focus on burden. Last year, he wrote a post to other autistic children: ""Know you are not a burden or trouble for being. You are a person who has every right to be. A family that is saying love but saying you are so hard so wrong for not being as they wanted. The family is wrong. Not You."" Meanwhile, Amy Sequenzia, an autistic activist and blogger, wrote, ""I am very disabled, have most of the usual not autism but co-occurring conditions, seizures almost every day, but am happy, proud and accomplished, with the human supports I have. That's what is missing. Acceptance."" As children, Sequenzia and Frost might well have been just the kinds of people labeled as ""gone,"" by Kennedy. Clearly, both are very much present. The solution lies in understanding autism and related conditions as part of human diversity. Michael S. Monje Jr., an autistic writer and editor with Autonomous Press, wrote, ""The neurodiversity movement is a direct counter to this kind of attitude. It is a way for autistic people, as well as anyone else who experiences the world differently due to their neurology, to assert that these natural divergences in human development are just that -- natural. The fact that they are largely unsupported by our society as it is currently configured does not make them in any way less natural, less worthy, or less beautiful than other ways of being in the world."" I wish Kennedy realized how much his apology demeaned people with intellectual disabilities, even as he defended the sacred status of the Holocaust. There is, though, one story from the Holocaust that he might do well to consider. The first group the Nazis systematically exterminated, in the infamous Action T4, were people with intellectual and other kinds of disabilities.  Thousands of children, adolescents and adults were sent to gas chambers, laying the groundwork for the later, larger scale acts of genocide. Underlying Action T4 was the belief that people with disabilities were devoid of value. We fight those beliefs by celebrating neurodiversity, not by fearmongering. Kennedy owes a lot of people another apology."
"Thick smoke has been billowing from the fire in Slitting Mill Road in Rugeley, Staffordshire, since the blaze began on 5 September.
The fire service said a controlled burn was taking place over fears water supplies could be contaminated.
It is not known how long it will take to put the fire out.
More updates on this and other stories in Staffordshire
Resident Steve Povey said he and others were also concerned about ""something toxic"" in the air that could affect people's long-term health, including his pregnant daughter.
Alison Shaw, manager of the nearby Horns Inn, said the pub's takings were also down because of the blaze.
""Last week alone we have been down Â£3,000... we're very angry about it.""
MP for Cannock Chase Amanda Milling also said it was ""unacceptable"" the fire was still burning.
The fire service said it was informed there was to be a two-hour controlled burn on the land on 5 September, but later received a 999 call to say it had got out of control.
Dermot Hogan, group manager of Staffordshire Fire Service, said he was aware of residents' frustrations.
Crews have been smothering part of the fire with soil, using foam to suppress the smoke and trying to remove burnt waste, he said.
The Environment Agency said there were fears the water run off could contaminate the local watercourse and potentially impact groundwater supplies.
Staffordshire County Council confirmed the land owner was instructed to remove rubbish from the site in June, and has since been served with enforcement notices."
"Graeme Finlay leaving Teesside Crown Court. He is accused of attacking husband and wife Ronald and June Phillips while on board a cruise ship . The passenger accused of beating an elderly couple on a luxury cruise ship claimed yesterday the violence erupted in a row over an awkward silence at dinner. Graeme Finlay, 53, insisted he acted in self-defence after being attacked by Ron Phillips, 70, wielding his crutch. The 16-stone British Gas engineer, who was travelling alone, confronted Mr Phillips and his wife June, 69, about their rudeness in ignoring him when he joined their table for dinner, a court heard. The couple were knocked unconscious after he allegedly assaulted them outside their cabin. But yesterday Finlay said he only swung his arms to defend himself when Mr Phillips went for him with his crutch. He denied attacking Mrs Phillips. He claimed Mr Phillips threw a cup of cocoa in his face and hit him with the crutch when he demanded an apology. He told the court: ‘I felt myself being struck by something sharp and I put my arms over my face to defend myself – I covered my face with my arms, I didn’t want my eye poked out.’ He said he swung his arms outwards and felt them connect with retired engineer Mr Phillips, from Middlesbrough. They were on board the Thomson Celebration liner off Lanzarote when the incident happened in January last year. Finlay, a Glaswegian, gave jurors at Teesside Crown Court a picture of the social pitfalls of the lone traveller when he described being snubbed in the restaurant. He said he enjoyed going to musical shows and filled his time with excursions, but dinner could be a ‘bit awkward’. He recalled joining two couples and said ‘good evening’ as he sat down. ‘I am actually quite a shy person – it is not particularly easy for me when I meet strangers,’ he added. ‘One of the ladies opposite me said “good evening” back, but the other three didn’t say anything to me, which I thought was a bit awkward. I was handed a menu and realised I was going to be in the situation for the next hour or so. ‘I then spotted a couple I’d met the previous evening and I said to the people at the table, “Excuse me, I’m just leaving as I recognise some people over there”.’ The couple were travelling on a Thomson Celebration cruise ship when it is claimed they were viciously attacked. The liner was cruising off the coast of Lanzarote when it is alleged Graeme Finlay beat the pair . Later he went to a cabaret show and played cards in the casino. He then encountered Mr Phillips carrying two cups of hot chocolate in the lift. Emboldened by an evening drinking alcohol, Finlay said he gave a ‘bit of a speech’ to Mr Phillips about his behaviour at dinner. ‘I said, “Excuse me, I don’t want you to take this the wrong way, but I felt really awkward at the table – it would have been nice if you had said good evening when I said good evening”. His reply to that was “f*** off”. I couldn’t believe he reacted like that.’ The argument continued in the corridor where Finlay claimed he was attacked. Mr Phillips, who uses a crutch because of a hip-replacement operation, suffered facial injuries and his wife two fractured vertebrae. Finlay was ‘disembarked’ from the ship and had to make his own way back to Glasgow. He said he needed three stitches in a wound to his arm allegedly caused by the crutch. He added: ‘I feel deeply ashamed I have been involved in such a thing. I was very shocked to hear about the couple’s injuries. I have found it very hard to live with the shame. I feel sorry for everyone involved.’ On Tuesday, Mr and Mrs Phillips told the court Finlay had ambushed them without warning outside their room and beat them. Mr Phillips said: ‘Never in my life have I hit anyone, not even my wife – you can ask her.’ Finlay denies charges of unlawful wounding and assault causing grievous bodily harm. The case continues. Finlay, 53, says he was ‘ignored’ when he joined their table and so moved to another after looking at the menu, Teesside Crown Court heard. He told the court he was on the ship alone and had drunk two pints of lager, three glasses of red wine and around five vodka and Cokes that evening .

"The very first black James Bond villain, Yaphet Kotto, has said the legendary secret agent role should only ever be portrayed by a white actor and 'political correctness be damned'. Kotto, who starred as Dr Kananga in the 1973 Bond installment Live And Let Die, said the role was created by Ian Fleming for a white actor and should be portrayed on the big screen as such. His comments come in response to months of speculation that black British actor Idris Elba is in the running to be named as Daniel Craig's successor. Scroll down for video . Yaphet Kotto (pictured opposite Roger Moore in Live And Let Die) said James Bond cannot be portrayed by a black man . In an interview with Big Issue, Kotto said: 'Political correctness be damned, we have to stay with what is literally correct.' He said: 'He was established as a white character, played by white actors. I don't think it's right for black actors or writers to do roles that whites have made historically white roles.' Kotto argued that a black man could play 003 or 006, but could not be 007, and suggested new characters should be written for black heroes. Last month veteran Bond actor Roger Moore was widely condemned for his claim that Elba, 42, could not be the next James Bond because he was not 'English English' enough. Following the publication of the interview, Sir Roger faced strong criticism on Twitter over the statement. He made the 'English-English' comments, even though former Bonds Sean Connery, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan were Scottish, Welsh and Irish. After being accused of 'racism', he claimed his comments were lost in translation during the interview with a French magazine. Elba is seen as the leading contender to play Bond once Daniel Craig holsters his Walther PPK for the last time. Hackney-born Idris Elba (pictured) has been tipped to replace Daniel Craig as the next James Bond actor . Current James Bond Daniel Craig (pictured) has said Elba is the only possible choice to replace him . He was born in Hackney, raised in East Ham, schooled in Canning Town, started work in Dagenham and he supports Arsenal. However, with speculation rampant he is being lined up to replace Craig, Elba himself has said he has ruled out taking the role. Today The Sun reported him as saying: 'It's a rumour that's really started to eat itself. If there was a chance of me getting Bond, it's gone.' He also responded to claims he was not 'English' enough for the role, stating he was 'born and raised' in England. Following Live and Let Die, Kotto went on to take central roles in several successful Hollywood films, including Alien and Midnight Run. Sean Connery, pictured, who was replaced as Bond by Roger Moore, played 007 with a Scottish accent . Timothy Dalton, left, who played James Bond during the 1980s following Moore, was born in Wales .

"Apple was sued in 2014 for allegedly using a technology developed by a professor and his students in its iPhone chips without the University of Wisconsin-Madison's permission.
Apple was ordered to pay about $234m (Â£179m) when it lost the patent case.
That sum has now been more than doubled because it continued to use the tech.
The judge said that additional damages and interest brought the sum owed to $506m.
However, Apple still hopes to overthrow the fine by appealing against the original jury verdict.
The penalty is still less than the $862m the university had originally sought in damages.
That is because Apple was found not to have deliberately infringed the university's microchip technology.
The patent in question outlined a way to boost computing performance by predicting how processors are about to be used.
The original case covered Apple's use of the invention in its A7, A8 and A8X processors, which are found in devices including the iPhone 5S and the iPad Air 2.
Apple did not re-engineer the chips after losing the dispute in 2015 nor pull the relevant products from sale, and thus became liable for the additional payout.
The university is also seeking further compensation for Apple's continued infringement of the patent in its A9 and A9X chips, which power its iPhone 6S and iPad Pro models.
However, the follow-up legal action has been put on hold until Apple's appeal has been considered."
"No-one was in the vehicle when it careered rear-end first into the side of the building in Dromore Road Retail Park in Omagh at about 17:00 BST on Thursday.

"Syrian state media says toxic gas was contained in shells that rebels have been firing at government-held areas in the divided city.
Russian news agency Interfax says seven people died and more than 20 were hospitalised after Tuesday's attack.
There has been no independent confirmation of the claim.
It comes after reports from a rebel-held town in Idlib province that chlorine gas was dropped on it late on Monday after a Russian military helicopter had earlier been shot down nearby.
A battle has continued since the weekend in Aleppo, as rebels attempt to break a government siege of a rebel-controlled area.
It is expected to be decisive for the future of a city that was once a commercial heartland but has been destroyed by five years of war.
About a quarter of a million civilians are living under siege since government forces cut them off last month.
The latest reports from the area are that the government, backed by Russian jets, has regained some ground. It is not clear exactly which territory has returned to government control but a reporter for a Beirut-based TV station said the army had regained control of two out of three villages that it lost near Aleppo earlier this week.
Russian and Syrian forces say they have been operating seven so-called humanitarian corridors, allowing hundreds of people to leave the besieged area peacefully.
On Wednesday, Russian state television ran pictures of civilians and fighters leaving. Smoke was seen billowing over the city in the footage, and gunshots were heard.
The UN's Children's Fund (Unicef) said it is ""extremely"" concerned for the safety of children caught up in violence in the city.
Saad Houry, of the fund, said children make up a third of the population trapped in the siege, and called for unhindered humanitarian access and for children to be protected.
The New York-based Physicians for Human Rights group said the last week of July was the worst week for attacks on medical facilities in the region since the Syrian war began in 2011. In a statement, the group said it has verified six deadly air strikes against hospitals in Aleppo governorate, all perpetrated by Syrian government forces.
Widney Brown of Physicians for Human Rights said: ""Destroying hospitals is tantamount to signing thousands of death warrants for people now stranded in eastern Aleppo."""

"The MCC has announced the latest phase of its 'Masterplan' redevelopment of Lord's which includes the replacement of the 'tired' Tavern and Allen stands. The intention is to build a single new structure in their place, with more than 5,500 seats, in the south-western corner of the home of cricket - to raise the ground's overall capacity to almost 30,000. MCC is operating to a projected budget of £80million, and hopes work can begin in autumn 2017 - subject to planning permission, consultation with nearby residents and the approval of club members. MCC reveals plans to replace the 'tired' Tavern and Allen stands at Lord's, with completion scheduled for 2019 . The redevelopment will increase the overall capacity of Lord's, the home of English cricket, to almost 30,000 . If the project goes ahead, a new Thomas Lord Building and new Tavern pub will also be included - as well as enlarged dressing rooms in the pavilion and a 'more pedestrian-friendly entrance to the ground', via the Grace Gates. MCC chief executive Derek Brewer said: 'The south-western project will ensure facilities for players, match officials, supporters and MCC members are of the highest possible standard by modernising areas of the ground that have become tired. 'MCC is committed to maintaining Lord's as the finest cricket ground in the world, and this project also provides a wonderful new front door to the home of cricket.' MCC aims to submit a planning application to Westminster City Council this summer. A completion schedule for the new stand is spring 2019, in time for that summer's World Cup and Ashes. It is anticipated the remaining elements of the 'Masterplan' may take a further three years. The 'Masterplan', which has a projected budget of £80million, should be ready for the World Cup and Ashes ."
"Sydneysiders missed out on Saturday night's lunar eclipse, but Melbourne and Adelaide residents had a spectacular view of the 'blood moon' as it lit up the sky. Wet and cloudy weather was to blame in Sydney, where the Sydney Observatory said the short lunar began at 10.58pm (AEDT) and finished at 11.03pm. 'Our live feed from Griffith Observatory is showing gorgeous totality pink!' observatory staff wrote on Twitter at about 11pm, accompanying their tweet with a picture of equipment showing off the bright pink moon. Scroll down for video . The lunar eclipse as seen from Melbourne on Easter Saturday, April 4. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon is completely in the Earth's shadow . Wet and cloudy weather was to blame for Sydneysiders missing out on the view, but the Sydney Observatory captured every moment with their equipment . Brisbane was also predicted to miss out due to bad weather, but the moon was pictured revealing itself through rain clouds towards the end of a total lunar eclipse . The beginning of the eclipse was captured from behind leaves illuminated by a street light in Canberra on Saturday . 'It's highly likely that it will still be cloudy,' The Bureau of Meteorology's Chris Webb had said of Sydney, adding that a break in the clouds at precisely the right moment could still present a slim chance for hopeful sky gazers. Brisbane, Darwin, Canberra and Hobart residents were also promised slim chance of viewing the phenomenon due to poor weather conditions, but clear night skies were predicted for Adelaide, Melbourne and Perth. Those faced with bad weather may not have missed out on much however, with the event being one of the shortest lunar eclipses of the century. 'Some sources indicate it will be around 10 minutes of totality, which will make it the shortest since 1917, but other sources say it will be less than five minutes which makes it the shortest since 1592,' Sydney Observatory astronomer Andrew Smith told the ABC earlier. Despite rain and clouds predicted to obscure the event for Canberrians, this image was taken of the full moon behind clouds on Saturday night .

Residents of Auckland in New Zealand also had a spectacular view of the 'blood moon' A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the edge of the earth's shadow. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it appears red. The eclipse is the third in a series of four blood moons, with the final one expected on September 28. Part of the lunar eclipse is seen behind fully bloomed cherry blossoms in Utsunomiya in Tochigi prefecture, 100km north of Tokyo on April 4 .

A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the Sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it makes it appear red. This gives rise to its 'blood red' appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic. Simon Allen, BOM's senior meteorologist, told the ABC that Adelaide would have the clearest skies out of all the states - where the partial eclipse began at 8.45pm and the peak at 10:30pm. In Brisbane, cloudy conditions and showers were forecast, denting the chances of seeing the eclipse. There was no rain in Melbourne, where an uninterrupted view of the lunar event began at 9:15pm and peaked at 11pm. Less positive wass the forecast for Hobart, which was for clouds and a 20 per cent chance of rain. The same was also expected in Canberra and a late storm was due in Darwin, however the former managed to clear up enough for some to see the lunar show. Those who miss out will have to wait until January 31, 2018, for the next lunar eclipse visible from Australia. As did the Echo Park district of Los Angeles. Early risers in the western U.S. and Canada were treated to the spectacle before dawn Saturday .

"A Scottish castle commandeered by Winston Churchill to help prepare troops for the D-Day landings has gone on sale for £1.75million. The 19th century Castle Toward, near Dunoon, was used to ready soldiers for landing at a beach and was commissioned as HMS Brontosaurus in 1942. Overlooking the Clyde estuary and with easy access to the sloping shoreline, the castle was deemed an ideal training ground for thousands of British troops. Soldiers practised beach landings - complete with bombs, smokescreens and strafing fighters - jumping from landing craft and clambering up the beach in preparation for the events of June 6, 1944, in Normandy. For sale: Castle Toward, near Dunoon, which played a crucial but little-known role in defeating the Nazis, has gone on the market for £1.75m . Training ground: Overlooking the Clyde estuary and with easy access to the sloping shoreline, the castle was used as a training base for D-Day . Danger: The training at the grounds was very realistic and incredibly demanding - many servicemen were killing during exercises . Allied soldiers would spend a week of intensive training at the castle, which included swimming in full kit and daily exercises on the surrounding hills. Brontosaurus was visited by both Churchill and Supreme Allied Commander Lord Mountbatten during this time. The training was so realistic and demanding that many servicemen were killed in accidents. The castle's rich military history is still clear to see. One room is named after Churchill and the foundations of the huts built to accommodate visiting troops still stand in parts of the grounds. Preparations: The grounds of the 19th century castle on the Cowal Peninsula in Argyll and Bute was used to ready troops for D-Day . Deep waters: Swimming training saw the forces jump off the pier and they then had to wade to shore in full military gear . Army base: Troops were stationed at the castle, where they trained off the coast of Scotland, in preparation for the D-Day landings of 1944 . Camp: With easy access to the sloping shoreline, Castle Toward was a perfect place to train troops in amphibious warfare . Historic: The D-Day landings on June 6, 1944, led to the liberation of France from Nazi control, and contributed to an Allied victory in the war . Timings: The Normandy landings were originally scheduled to take place in May - then postponed until June and put off again at the last minute for 24 hours due to bad weather . Across the UK, troops took part in various military exercises in preparation for D-Day. In late 1943 the war cabinet had agreed to the building of an assault training centre on the south Devon coast, and 3,000 civilians in six villages were ordered to leave their homes. The first large training exercises - on the south Devon coast at Slapton Sands – revealed communications problems, lack of mission comprehension, poor crisis management abilities and a general sense of chaos. On April 28, 1944, 749 US soldiers and sailors died after three ships involved in a training exercise were ambushed by German torpedo. Exercise Tiger was one of the biggest full-scale rehearsals before D-day, involving all 23,000 US soldiers who were planning to land on the Normandy beach codenamed Utah. Slapton Sands had been chosen because of its similarity to the French beach. Apart from the Devon and Scotland coastline, training also took place at Camp Gordon Johnston near Carrabelle, Florida. Mr Jepson, of the Combined Operations Association, said the troops stationed at the castle were planning for a return to mainland Europe. He said it was essential the different branches of the forces - army, navy and air - learned to work together for the return to France. He said: 'They had to start from scratch and start planning for the return to France. They started the combined service centres where they planned the actual landings. 'Of course they had very little to start off with. They developed various crafts and weapons.' Speaking about the conditions for the troops at Brontosaurus, he explained: 'They were under a lot of pressure. Sadly there were a lot of accidents and a lot of people were killed. 'With the ramp down they would jump into what they thought was shallow water and some drowned.' 'Swimming training would see them jump off the pier and swim to shore in full kit.' He said the RAF would at times fly over the Scottish beaches dropping bombs and smoke screens. 'It had to be as realistic as possible,' he said. 'It must have been an amazing site with the landing crafts, ships and tanks coming and going.' Talking about Castle Toward he said: 'It was ideal where it was. It's a beautiful building and historically important.' Castle Toward was built in 1820 by Kirkman Finlay, a former Lord Provost of Glasgow, as his family's country house. Following its use by the Allied Forces, the estate was bought by the Corporation of Glasgow in 1946 and was used as an educational facility. Its ownership passed to Argyll and Bute Council in 1996 after local government reorganisation and the authority has been trying to sell the estate for the past few years. It has only been put on the open market after plans for a community buyout were rejected by the council after it only offered £850,000. The castle includes 25 bedrooms, six reception rooms and extensive grounds with stunning views over the Cowal peninsula near Dunoon. On the market: The castle, which is being sold by estate agents, Baird Lumsden, contains 12 shower rooms and an observation tower . Historic: The castle offers stunning views over the Cowal peninsula near Dunoon and is set within 125 acres of land . Picturesque: The property enjoys fine views over the Clydeestuary towards the Isles of Bute, Arran and Cumbrae ."
"Defeat sees Burton slip to 21st, two points clear of the drop zone, as they lost for the third time in five games.
In a first half of few chances, Damien McCrory and Jamie Ward fired over for the hosts, while Huddersfield's Nahki Wells blazed a free-kick over.
Wells then turned match-winner, heading in Christopher Schindler's knock-back from Aaron Mooy's free-kick.
Huddersfield remain nine points adrift of current leaders Brighton, who won 3-2 at Blackburn, but the Brewers are just a place above the relegation zone as their five-match unbeaten home run in the Championship came to an end.
Ater going close before the break, Ward curled a shot over the bar in the second half.
Huddersfield forward Elias Kachunga saw his goal-bound shot cleared off the line by McCrory as the visitors looked the most likely to score.
But they had to wait until the 85th minute as Mooy's long free-kick was headed back in the box by Schindler and nodded in by Wells for his fifth goal of the season.
Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough:
""We deserved at least a point out of the game. The players were magnificent from start to finish and couldn't give any more.
""We've played well, created chances but just couldn't finish one and then they pop up in the 85th minute.
""We are unlucky not to get the result but we are not disappointed in the performance - it was excellent.""
Huddersfield Town manager David Wagner:
""We can be very happy about the three points. We knew that fighting spirit and working attitude would be very important and this is what they have shown.
""The offensive performance was not our best but this was not the most important thing.
""We showed the right attitude and that is why I am very proud of them that they did the right things at the right moments.""

"A man driving to work in Alabama suddenly noticed his stolen pickup truck following him last week. That set off a chain of events that included a deputy's pursuit, a crash, and an arrest. A man contacted police Friday after noticing he was driving in front of the truck that had been stolen from him earlier that morning near Piedmont, Calhoun County Chief Deputy Matthew Wade told WBRC-TV. Scroll down for video . Chase: This grab taken from dashcam footage shows a deputy pursuing a truck. A man driving to work in Alabama had earlier noticed his stolen pickup truck following him .

"A heroic mother saved her daughter from the jaws of a 13ft crocodile in a 10-minute long battle, armed only with a wooden washing paddle. Diwalinen Vankar, 58, had gone with her 19-year-old daughter Kanta, to the bank of the Vishwamitri River, 40 kilometres from Vadodara, in west India, to wash their clothes. As they were wringing out their laundry, a mugger crocodile grabbed Kanta's right leg and dragged her into the murky river.

But the mugger crocodile clasped its powerful jaws round her daughter with its razor-sharp teeth. Vankar said: 'I was using all my force to pull her back, but the crocodile was so powerful I could not move her an inch. 'For a moment I felt the crocodile would drown my daughter as it tried to roll into the water.' But the quick-thinking mother then decided to attack the crocodile - that can grow up to 15 feet long - with her washing paddle. 'For several minutes I tried to pull her with my hands, but then I got hold of the wooden bat and started hitting its head forcefully', she said. 'Her leg was trapped between the piercing teeth as she cried in pain, her hands were scratching the river bank to get a grip but it didn't let her go. 'It took me 10 minutes to finally free her from its jaws.' Kanta suffered a leg injury after the crocodile grabbed her right leg and dragged her into the murky river . This map shows the Vishwamitri River, near Vadodara, where the attack by the crocodile took place . Vankar said she went to wash her clothes in the river as there was a lack of water and electricity in the village . After hearing the commotion, villagers rushed to help and drove Kanta to hospital, where doctors were treated her for a leg injury. She has since been discharged. Speaking from the hospital, her mother said: 'I thank God for saving my daughter. The injuries are not that serious and doctors say she will be fine in sometime.' She said they had been forced to wash their clothes in the river because of a shortage of water and electricity in the village, but vowed never to return. A wildlife officer said the river is home to ferocious crocodiles and villagers have been warned to steer clear of the river. 'She has miraculously survived. These crocodiles are huge and ferocious,' Ashok Pandya, Vadodara wildlife officer told the Times of India. 'We have been warning them not to go near the river.' Last year, six people were killed in crocodile attacks across Vadodara. There are more than 200 crocodiles in the Vishwamitri River.

"Cardiff North MP Jonathan Evans said it was ""a tragedy"" there was no agreement on who should chair the inquiry, set up after claims of paedophiles operating in Westminster in the 1980s.
The Conservative MP said cases should be investigated by the police first.
Child abuse survivors have urged the government to scrap the inquiry.
Instead, they want it replaced with a more powerful body.
It comes after Home Secretary Theresa May told inquiry members their panel might be disbanded.
The Met Police said earlier this month that detectives were investigating three alleged murders as part of their investigation into historical child abuse.
Mr Evans, who is chairman of the Welsh Tory party and a former deputy chairman of the Welsh NSPCC council, said: ""Now I hear that a number of the groups who are representing victims have suggested the whole of the process should be stopped and a different sort of inquiry created.
""I don't know exactly what the terms of that inquiry should be and I'm not really sure what they mean by setting up a stronger inquiry because I think the inquiry that was being set up was a pretty strong one.""
He said ongoing police inquiries introduced a ""new dimension"", and that they appeared to be proceeding on the basis of new evidence ""in which the police have already made it clear to the media that there are real issues that are being investigated"".
""It seems to me that those police inquiries have got to now take precedence. We ought not to have a situation in which we set up an inquiry and then we can only do half the job because police inquiries are ongoing.""
Mr Evans, who was a Wales Office minister in the 1990s when the UK government set up the Waterhouse inquiry into abuse allegations at children's homes in north Wales, added: ""It seems to me that the police inquiries are now at the forefront.""
He said Mrs May should not be blamed for delays to the inquiry, which has been held up by the resignation of her first two choices of chairperson.
Victims must have confidence in the process, Mr Evans said, ""and so the reason we are in the situation we are in is that we are struggling to find a chairman that the victims' groups will have confidence in""."
"Mrs Merkel said she wanted friendly relations with both countries as well as Russia but Europe now had to ""fight for its own destiny"".
Her comments come after Mr Trump refused to re-commit to the 2015 Paris climate deal at the G7 summit.
Mrs Merkel is on the campaign trail ahead of elections in September.
""The times in which we could completely depend on others are on the way out. I've experienced that in the last few days,"" Mrs Merkel told a crowd at an election rally in Munich, southern Germany.
The relationship between Berlin and new French President Emmanuel Macron had to be a priority, Mrs Merkel said, adding: ""We Europeans have to take our destiny into our own hands.""
On Saturday, the German leader had described climate change talks at the G7 group of rich nations as ""very unsatisfactory"".
Leaders from the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan had re-affirmed their support for the Paris accord - but Mr Trump said he would make a decision in the coming week.
Mr Trump has previously pledged to abandon the Paris deal, and expressed doubts about climate change.
Speaking in Brussels last week, Mr Trump also told Nato members to spend more money on defence and did not re-state his administration's commitment to Nato's mutual security guarantees.
Mrs Merkel's latest comments are partly a move to appeal to German voters first and foremost, the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says.
Polls suggest Mrs Merkel is on course to be re-elected for a fourth term as German chancellor at elections in September.
It might have been thanks to the beer, pretzels and Bavarian brass-band enlivening the crowd.
But Mrs Merkel's words were uncharacteristically passionate and unusually forthright. By all means keep friendly relations with Trump's America and Brexit Britain, was the message - but we can't rely on them.
Rapturous applause greeted her fiery calls for Europeans to fight for their own destiny.
No wonder she's sounding confident. France has a new president who shares her pro free-trade, Europhile values, so there is a positive feeling in Europe that the EU's Franco-German motor is back in business.
With four months to go before elections, Angela Merkel's position also looks stronger than ever domestically. Initial enthusiasm for her centre-left rival Martin Schulz has fizzled out. And Sunday's beer-tent event underscored her strength by marking an end to a potential split with her Bavarian sister conservative party.
She might not have welcomed Brexit or Trump. But it seems that Mrs Merkel has decided that standing up for the EU will only strengthen her chances of winning another term in September."
"Mark Wood spent a day this week donning his newly arrived England suit. ‘I wore it around the house a bit too much really but I was absolutely buzzing just to have it on. ‘Trying it on is when the mixture of nerves and excitement started,’ says Wood, one of the uncapped members of Alastair Cook’s squad who fly to the Caribbean on Thursday for a three-Test series against West Indies. The 25-year-old would be forgiven for checking the fit, because standing at 5ft 11in and weighing just over 12st, he is not the shape or size of your traditional fast bowler. Mark Wood has been called up by England for the Test series against West Indies . When he’s not steaming in to bowl at 90mph Mark Wood can find himself fielding for long stretches of time. Thankfully the Durham paceman has the perfect remedy to keep things interesting during a lengthy stint on the boundary rope. ‘There are times when it gets boring in the field, so I bring out the imaginary horse and try to joust my team-mates,’ Wood said recently. ‘I don’t know how the England boys will take it, but I’ll have a go. I like to have a trot and feed him apples — he loves Granny Smiths. ‘Sometimes it’s just the pick-me-up the lads need. The horse will probably come with me to the Caribbean if he gets through immigration. If they don’t like it then I can just tie him up and leave him somewhere.’ But England are looking for something different in the wake of their woeful World Cup and Wood, whose ability to hurry batsmen from a short run-up is reminiscent of Craig White and Simon Jones from previous eras, fits the bill. Several players on the county circuit last season would testify that he was the slipperiest bowler they faced. ‘I can hit 90mph but it’s not something I tend to concentrate on,’ said Wood. ‘The quickest ball I have been clocked at on the telly was 91 but I am sure I can bowl quicker than that. ‘You know yourself, without the speed guns, when it’s coming out lovely and the rhythm’s there. ‘When I bowl I am not just trying to blast people out, I would like to think that being the slight lad that I am with a short run-up, it is more the surprise element that gets batters in trouble. I tend to rush them a little bit but would like to think I have more skills than just raw pace.’ Primary among those skills is a mastery of reverse swing. It was no coincidence that his first three County Championship appearances for Durham all came at Trent Bridge, where the abrasive nature of the square roughs the ball up perfectly for exponents of the art. Durham paceman is not the shape or size of your traditional fast bowler . But he has also displayed a marked improvement in his use of the new ball, swinging it to good effect whenever he got it during the 2014 season. Previously, he faced a battle to prise it from the hands of his Durham team-mates Graham Onions and Chris Rushworth. So a marker of his progress was provided at the turn of this year when he was opening the bowling for England Lions on the tour of South Africa. That breakthrough moment on the field has been replicated off it, with Wood’s devotion to the ECB’s fitness regime enabling him to play a string of matches following a career punctuated by injuries, including stress fractures of the back, a cyst on his left ankle, knee trouble and side strains. ‘My body type has changed a lot since I was the lad who broke through into the first team,’ he said. ‘I have done two winters now where they have basically pumped us up in the gym to get us stronger and fitter. ‘I did a four-week camp in Potchefstroom, South Africa, before Christmas when I was smashing myself along with the other fast bowlers. That got me the Lions call-up and off that, maintaining that strength, got me the Test call-up.’ Wood has sought advice from former Durham and England fast bowler Steve Harmison . His first-class haul of 74 wickets at 26 runs apiece is creditable even if his number of appearances, 23, is a bit thin. But as he showed in taking four Australia A wickets in as many overs in a Durham win at Chester-le-Street three years ago, he has the knack of getting good players out. It may help him sneak ahead of Liam Plunkett or Chris Jordan in the pace pecking order. ‘I am not going to the West Indies to make the numbers up. I want to play a Test match, whether it be the first, middle or last one,’ he said. ‘It’s a good opportunity. As an England fan it has been frustrating to watch during the winter but everyone will agree that to put things right we have to start in the Caribbean.’ It was for the carnage created at Sabina Park, Jamaica, that Steve Harmison, another cricketing son of Ashington, was renamed Grievous Bodily Harmison 11 years ago. ‘There’s no pressure on us, is there?’ said Wood. ‘The last lad from Ashington took seven for 12. But if I get half of that I will be doing all right. Steve’s a family friend so he’s offered me advice on what the pitches will be like and how I should go about things. The main thing he told me is that the stumps don’t move — we had a bit of a joke about that because of the ball he bowled in Brisbane (the first delivery of the 2006-07 Ashes, which went straight to Andrew Flintoff at second slip) — his point being that if you make sure you get the first one on target you’ll be fine after that.’ They are big shoes to fill but Wood appears comfortable in his own."
"Dundee United have hit back at fierce criticism of the board's performance by two leading supporters' groups. Arabtrust and the Federation of Dundee United Supporters Clubs say they are 'shocked' that 25 per cent of £6.3million worth of transfer fees for Ryan Gauld, Andrew Robertson, Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven were paid in commission to unnamed parties. The supporters groups also disputed chairman Stephen Thompson's alleged level of investment in the club. The Dundee United board have hit back at criticism from supporters by pointing to their on-field success . The Tannadice club - already under fire for selling Armstrong and Mackay-Steven to Celtic six weeks before their League Cup final defeat to the Scottish champions - responded by defending their record in a statement. It read: 'All supporters can be assured that the board will continue to implement its professional and comprehensive strategy for the football club. 'This strategy and the related actions of the chairman and board of directors have delivered progress both on and off field. 'On the field the club has reached back-to-back domestic cup finals for the first time in 29 years, qualified for European competition in three of the last four years, finished in the Premiership top six in every one of the last seven years and won the Scottish Cup in 2010. 'The current management team and players are also sitting fourth in the Premiership this season with sights firmly set on securing a European qualification place.' The supporters' joint statement expressed concern over the levels of club debts, saying: 'Despite the sales of the four players the board of DUFC does not believe that this is yet sufficient to pay all current remaining debt.' Defending their record on that point, the club statement responded: 'Off field the board has reduced overall debt, including Thompson family loans, from £5.2m in February 2014 to £2.6m while successfully extricating the club from all bank debt. The club debt is projected to be reduced to £1.4m by the end of this year. 'Supporters can rest assured that the board is comprised of individuals that are, without exception, Dundee United supporters. They bring with them a wealth of experience in business. 'At all times, the board acts to promote the success of Dundee United and will continue to do so.' Arabtrust and the Federation also voiced concerns that chairman Thompson was wary of bringing in external investors for fear of seeing his family's shareholding drop below 75 per cent. The most explosive allegation, however, is the claim concerning the commission paid to outside parties – none of whom are understood to be players, agents or other clubs. The supporters' joint statement added: 'We believe this figure to be in excess of £500k. This does not include payments to players, agents or other clubs. When all of these various payments are totalled, over 25 per cent of the £6.3m in fees received has not been kept in the club.' United last year announced that a recent debt settlement would see the Bank of Scotland collect a share of transfer fees received before the end of August 2015. A United spokesman said: 'We've been reluctantly drawn into this matter and have no wish to enter a war of words, but the £500,000 figure is an entirely fictitious amount based on an incorrect assumption. At no time was that figure provided to anyone, so it's surprising to see it in the public domain.' Some supporters were angered by the amount of commission that was paid from transfer fees received ."
"Pregnant women who suffer extreme morning sickness are at greater risk of their children having language and speech delays, and attention disorders, warn researchers. A new study shows the condition suffered by the Duchess of Cambridge during both her pregnancies triples the risk of developmental problems compared with women who have normal nausea and vomiting. About 10,000 women a year in the UK are affected by the debilitating hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) - a severe form of morning sickness which causes constant vomiting, crippling weakness and dehydration. Pregnant women with hyperemesis gravidarum - the severe morning sickness suffered by Kate Middleton - are more likely to have children with language and speech delays, and attention disorders, a study claims . A new study from the University of California, Los Angeles, (UCLA) looks specifically at whether the condition affects brain development in childhood. Marlena Fejzo, an associate researcher in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said the link appeared to be due to lack of nutrition in early pregnancy – especially in the first five weeks – rather than medication. She said: ‘These findings show that it is vital to take HG seriously so these pregnant women can get nutritional support right away. ‘An encouraging finding is that we did not find any association with medications to treat this disorder and neurodevelopmental delays, so I speculate that the neurodevelopmental outcomes are more likely caused by nutrient deficiency early in pregnancy rather than medication.’ The research appears in the online edition of the European Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Reproductive Biology. The study looked at 312 children born to 203 mothers with HG between 2007 and 2011 and compared those to 169 children born to 89 mothers who did not have HG. More than 1,000 women with severe morning sickness have an abortion each year because their symptoms are so unbearable, research shows. Many are denied vital yet relatively cheap treatment by GPs who expect them to simply ‘get on with it’ or end their pregnancy. The condition Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG) – which the Duchess of Cambridge has suffered during both her pregnancies – affects about one in 100 expectant mothers a year. It is far more severe than ordinary morning sickness and some women are left bedbound or need to be admitted to hospital due to extreme dehydration. Research by abortion provider BPAS and Pregnancy Sickness Support found many women were refused treatment because doctors deemed it too costly, unnecessary or potentially harmful. The disorders found included attention and sensory disorders and learning, speech and language delays. Dr Fejzo said the mechanism for exposure to HG and the resulting abnormal neurologic development is not clear. The women in the study experienced nausea and vomiting so severe that they lost at least five pounds and became so dehydrated they needed intravenous fluids. Children exposed in the womb to HG had a 3.28-fold increased risk of neurodevelopmental delays. Dr Fejzo said: ‘There is an urgent need to address whether aggressive treatment that includes vitamin and nutrient supplementation in women with early symptoms of severe nausea and vomiting decreases that risk of neurodevelopmental delay.’ Previous studies have shown that HG is associated with low birth weight babies, small size for gestational age and pre-term births. Earlier research by Dr Fejzo’s team found HG was associated with a 3.6-fold increased risk of behavioural or emotional disorders in adults. The researchers are investigating the genetic basis of HG, as well as looking at risk factors and outcomes. They also hope to determine whether earlier treatment in women with symptoms limits or prevents the adverse outcomes identified in this study. The study states: ‘A significant increase in neurodevelopmental and behavioural disorders in children exposed to HG in utero was demonstrated which suggests HG may be linked to life-long effects on the exposed fetus. ‘The cause for this is unknown, but may be due to maternal stress, abnormal hormone levels during fetal development and/or maternal-newborn bonding after birth, or malnutrition and vitamin deficiency.’ Some women with the extreme sickness experienced nausea and vomiting so severe that they lost at least 5lbs (2.27kg) and became so dehydrated they needed intravenous fluids (file photo)"
"More than 130 owners have reported overheating problems behind the glove-box area, some of which have resulted in fires.
Vauxhall is investigating the problem, but has not yet issued a full recall.
The affected model is the Zafira B. It is thought that 280,000 of them are currently on the road in the UK.
The alarm was raised by three different women, who say their cars burst into flames.
Among them was Sue Freemantle, from Devon, who had four children in her Zafira when a fire began behind the dashboard.
Claire Wheatley also from Devon, had to evacuate her car along with her husband when a similar incident occurred.
They and others have posted pictures of the fires on Facebook.
Vauxhall has already examined 20 such cars which have been burned out, and has summoned engineers from Germany to investigate.
In a statement, it said it thought the heating and ventilation system was to blame.
It said previous repairs may have been carried out improperly, or in some cases, non-genuine parts may have caused the fires.
The affected models have manual air-conditioning, as pictured above.
Owners who have electronic climate control have not reported any problems.
The cars, all right-hand drive, were built between 2005 and 2014.
Anyone who has concerns about their vehicle is being asked to contact their dealer."
"#UporDown? That's the trending question on social media, thanks to a photo of a cat coming down some stairs. Or is it going up some stairs? (And you thought you were done with this kind of optical illusion free-for-all after #TheDress.) The picture was apparently uploaded on Imgur a few days ago and has caught fire thanks to a post on the website 9gag.com. Some people are noting the apparent motion of the cat. Others are commenting about the construction of the stairs. (Nobody has mentioned that some cats we could name would be more likely to stop in the middle of the steps and play with a mousie.) Of course, where there's public debate, there are advertisers waiting to take advantage of the situation. Taxes? Now, those are REALLY confusing."
"Vijaya Gadde, Twitter's top lawyer, admitted it has been ‘inexcusably slow’ in tackling online trolls . Twitter's top lawyer has admitted it has been ‘inexcusably slow’ in tackling online trolls who make the lives of others a misery. Vijaya Gadde said the social network had let internet abuse go ‘unchecked’ because it did not recognise the scope and scale of the problem. Miss Gadde said Twitter had tripled the size of the team that deals with online abuse – because it had to do better. She made the announcement on the day a study found that 88 per cent of abusive behaviour on social media happens on Twitter. Anti-bullying campaigners have also long complained that Twitter is a sanctuary for trolls who post hateful abuse behind the veil of anonymity. In an article for the Washington Post, Miss Gadde said that running Twitter required constant vigilance but that the company had ‘failed to live up to’ this aim. She admitted that ‘our response times have been inexcusably slow and the substance of our responses too meagre’. Miss Gadde wrote: ‘This is, to put it mildly, not good enough. ‘Freedom of expression means little as our underlying philosophy if we continue to allow voices to be silenced because they are afraid to speak up. We need to do a better job combating abuse without chilling or silencing speech’. Miss Gadde, general counsel for Twitter, said the extra staff the company had hired meant it was responding to five times as many complaints about abuse. The company was also making other changes ‘in ways that won’t be readily apparent’ to ensure its 284million users worldwide are safe.

"The average woman will spend an eye-watering £18,000 on products for her face in her lifetime, but may be throwing those hard earned pennies down the drain by applying them incorrectly. Indeed, many women make common mistakes every single day that could lead to their skin ageing faster. FEMAIL called on the best dermatologists in the business to shed some light on the classic mistakes women make and to share their vital tips for ensuring you're getting the most from your skincare regime. Scroll down for video . Many women spends hundreds of pounds a month on expensive skincare products but make common mistakes every single day that could lead to their skin ageing faster . DON'T ONLY USE SPF ON HOLIDAY . Perhaps one of the most common misconceptions women have is that you only need to use an SPF in boiling climates. Wrong. In fact, an SPF should be an essential part of your daily skincare regime, says Dr Mike Bell, Skincare Scientific Advisor for Boots UK. 'Protecting your skin from the sun and environmental stress is really important, particularly if you want to proactively delay the signs of ageing,' he said. Even when there isn't a ray of sunshine in the sky, your skin is still at harm. UVA  rays can penetrate glass, meaning your skin is at risk from ageing through your car windows or even when sitting at your desk. Dr. Adam Geyer, Kiehl’s Consulting Dermatologist, concurs. He said: 'Apply a broad spectrum, high SPF sunscreen before heading out the door each morning, with reapplication every 2-3 hours during peak outdoor exposure.' APPLY CREAMS IN THE CORRECT ORDER . Another simple way to make your products work harder (particularly if you've spent a small fortune on them) is applying them in the right order. Indeed, products with a thinner consistency - such as serum - should always be applied before thick face creams. Products with a thinner consistency - such as serum - should always be applied before thick face creams . Those creams with heavier consistencies can actually stop the lighter ones from penetrating the skin and doing the job they've been designed to do - practically making them redundant. NEVER SLEEP WITH YOUR HAIR DOWN . This is a common mistake copious amounts of women make - but one that can easily be rectified. Many people have forehead breakouts due to the oil clogging up their pores. Always tie your hair back loosely before you get into bed. By sleeping with your hair and fringe down, the oils from your locks (not to mention the greasy hairspray and serums you've used in the day) are kept well away from your face. NOT EVERYONE NEEDS A TONER . Cleanse, tone and moisturise is a mantra for millions of women, sold by the beauty industry as a sure-fire way to fresh, glowing skin. But while the benefits of cleansing and moisturising are obvious, part of the routine is simply habit for many women - and few question its benefits: toning. Toning is meant to remove the last traces of dirt and grime, leaving skin dewy and pores closed. According to market intelligence firm Mintel, one in five of us uses toners daily. But many women who religiously apply this classic skincare product don't realise toners can include harsh ingredients such as alcohol, which can dry out even the most oily skin, and parabens, which have been shown to induce allergic reactions. 'The alcohol found in toners can be a trigger for rosacea, increase the risk of breakouts in acne-prone skin or exacerbate sensitivity,' reveals cosmetic dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting. This means that regular use of toners could leave the skin irritated, inflamed and vulnerable to environmental damage. Dr Bunting believes that even if your toner doesn't harm your skin, its place in your beauty regime may be redundant. 'Soap used to leave behind residues, but today's cleansers are designed to rinse clean and don't disturb the skin's natural equilibrium in the same way, so there's no need to use a toner.' Dr Harold Lancer, author of Kim Kardashian's favourite book, Younger, comments: 'Most skincare regimens include a toner step, but not everyone needs one. 'Toners are primarily formulated to return the skin to its natural ph level. The ph is the balance between acidity and alkalinity in your body. The skin on the face is at its healthiest when it is slightly acidic. Acid prohibits bacterial growth that can contribute to acne and helps maintain the skin’s barrier function, keeping moisture in and harmful substances out. Alkaline skin is more prone to lines, wrinkles and sun damage. 'All that would seem to make toner a must, but if you have relatively normal skin, exfoliate regularly, and use a cleanser that does not strip your skin of its natural moisture, you should be able to maintain a healthy ph level. Lifestyle changes will do the rest.' By sleeping with your hair and fringe down, the oils from your locks (not to mention the greasy hairspray and serums you've used in the day) are kept well away from your face . DON'T OVER-CLEANSE . While the key to acne-free skin is squeaky clean skin, you can do more harm than good by over washing your face. You can also over exfoliate by buffing away too much of your top skin layer, which serves as a protective barrier against environmental toxins and sun damage - both of which accelerate the ageing process. Dr. Geoff Genesky, Kiehl’s Head of Laboratory, emphasises that consumers should also be careful to follow product instructions very carefully, especially when using products that have anti-ageing benefits but that can be a bit harsh to the skin's outermost layers. 'Making sure to wear sunscreens when using retinol or alpha hydroxy acid products comes to mind,' he said. 'As does limiting application to once or twice a week in the case of products with high concentrations of acid exfoliating ingredients or cleansers with particularly rough scrub particles.' DON'T USE TOO MUCH PRODUCT - AND DON'T BE LURED BY EXPENSIVE CREAMS . 'Don't be swayed by marketing hype - using the right product for your skin type is key,' advises Emma Leslie, editor at Escentual.com. 'Buying a cult £120 moisturiser that's optimised for dry skin when your skin is oily means that you won't reap its full benefits, and your skin will start to misbehave. Chat to a professional, they'll be more than happy to point you in the right direction.' Leslie also warns of the dangers of getting carried away and applying too much product. 'Applying more product doesn't mean you'll achieve better results,' she said. 'In fact, applying too much product could overload and irritate the skin, particularly around the sensitive eye area. Apply less product and pay more attention to the way you apply it (many brands will provide a step-by-step specialised application method), and you'll glean greater results.' USE THE RIGHT TECHNIQUES TO APPLY YOUR EYE CREAM . Cammie Cannella, Kiehl’s Vice President of Global Education and Customer Relations, explains another important tip: to be sure that you don’t use too much of any type of product in the eye area, to avoid overwhelming the skin there and potentially exacerbating any puffiness. 'For best results, dispense a very small amount - about the size of a pea - onto your fingertips and dot the product around the orbital bone first, then go back and lightly pat or press the formula into your skin (ideally using the ring finger, which is weakest and therefore the least likely to unnecessarily pull or stretch the delicate skin around the eyes),' she said."

"Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood has offered encouragement to a six-year-old fan he beat to the job. Charlie Pye, from Leamington Spa, applied for the Villa hotseat after Paul Lambert was sacked in February. The Villa fan wanted a chocolate bar as a win bonus and would have agreed terms for a signed claret and blue football, a WWE wrestling figure and some sweets. Sherwood wrote Charlie a letter congratulating him on his credentials, despite missing out on the job. Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood (centre) showed his softer side by replying to 6-year-old Charlie Pye . He wrote: 'From your letter it is clear to see that you would indeed be an ideal candidate for the job due to your knowledge of the game - and your very capable backroom staff, of course! 'Hopefully you're not too disappointed at missing out and I'm informed that I just managed to pip you to the post so you were very close to being offered the job. 'Our chief executive Tom Fox has informed me that the club would like your permission to keep the letter on file 'just in case' - although I'm hoping I will be successful at this great football club. The youngster applied for the role when Paul Lambert was sacked but was pipped to the post by Sherwood . 'I will certainly be aiming to make you and all the other supporters happy. 'In terms of your football career, I want to wish Norton Lindsey every success this season. Well done on being appointed captain. I was a captain during my own playing career - it's a special honour.' Sherwood has guided Villa six points above the relegation zone in the Barclays Premier League after Saturday's 1-0 win at former club Tottenham and taken them to Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool. Charlie had written to chief executive Tom Fox after Lambert was sacked with Villa in the relegation zone earlier this year. Pye is captain of Norton Lindsey and got a special message from Sherwood about being a captain . He wrote: 'I would appoint my mum and dad as assistant managers so they can drive me to the training ground each day. My mum is also very good at making bacon sandwiches for the players if that helps.' Charlie told the club's official site: 'I never expected a letter from the manager but I was absolutely delighted to get one. 'What he wrote was brilliant - it meant a lot to me. Even the stuff about congratulating me on being a captain was really special.' The 6-year-old would have appointed his parents as assistant managers if he had been offered the dream job ."

"An Ohio woman discovered that her biological mother worked at the same company as her and lived only six minutes away.

After receiving her records in the mail, La-Sonya Mitchell-Clark, 38, of Youngstown, finally got the answers she's wanted almost her whole life. She looked up her mother's name, Francine Simmons, on Facebook and found out she worked Infocision - the same call-center operation company she works at. La-Sonya Mitchell-Clark (left) of Youngstown, Ohio, found out her birth mother was Francine Simmons (right) after the Ohio Department of Heath released birth records for people born between January 1, 1964, and September 18, 1996, last month . 'Ever since I found out that I was adopted I wanted to know who my biological mother was,' Mitchell-Clark told WYTV. And after connecting the dots, she realized her mother was closer than she could imagine. 'There's a Francine that works at my job,' she said after finding the woman on Facebook. 'She works in VR and she works at the front desk.' She reached out to friends on social media who knew Simmons and the next day she got a phone call from her birth mother. 'She called me and I said, ""Is this Ms. Francine?"" She said, yes. I said, ""I think I'm your daughter"",' Mitchell-Clark said about the first time the women spoke. And, as it turns out, the mother and daughter live just six minutes away from one another in Youngstown. Simmons said she was 'still in shock' from finding out about her daughter, who she always wanted to contact but never knew how. Mitchell-Clark (left) reached out through social media to speak with Simmons (right) and they eventually decided to meet after a phone call.

"NASA says its Messenger space probe crashed into Mercury on Thursday after running out of fuel, ending a nearly 11-year journey that provided valuable data and thousands of photos. Mission controllers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, confirmed the probe slammed into the surface of Mercury, as anticipated, at 3:26 p.m. EDT, NASA told CNN in an email. NASA earlier said the probe was expected to hit the surface at 8,750 miles per hour and to create an impact crater 52 feet (16 meters) in diameter. The crash wasn't visible from Earth because it occurred on the far side of Mercury. Messenger (an acronym for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) was launched in 2004 and traveled more than 6½ years before it started circling Mercury on March 18, 2011. It was the first spacecraft to orbit the planet closest to the sun. It traveled about 5 billion miles -- a journey that included 15 trips around the sun. Spacecraft to make death dive into Mercury . The spacecraft was healthy when it crashed, but was out of fuel. When scientists determined there was no way to save it, they held a briefing this month to celebrate the mission's success. ""For the first time in history we now have real knowledge about the planet Mercury that shows it to be a fascinating world as part of our diverse solar system,"" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA headquarters in Washington. One of the mission's big findings: It sent back data indicating that ice in Mercury's shadowed polar regions, if spread over an area the size of Washington, would be more than two miles thick, NASA said. As the end neared, the probe sent back some final tweets thanking mission managers and counting down its final orbits. The Messenger mission is over, but scientists say they'll be busy for years studying data from the probe. And while the space probe won't be sending back anymore images, you can see Mercury with your own eyes. It's visible in the night sky just before dusk until about the end of May."
"I see signs of a revolution everywhere. I see it in the op-ed pages of the newspapers, and on the state ballots in nearly half the country. I see it in politicians who once preferred to play it safe with this explosive issue but are now willing to stake their political futures on it. I see the revolution in the eyes of sterling scientists, previously reluctant to dip a toe into this heavily stigmatized world, who are diving in head first. I see it in the new surgeon general who cites data showing just how helpful it can be. I see a revolution in the attitudes of everyday Americans. For the first time a majority, 53%, favor its legalization, with 77% supporting it for medical purposes. Support for legalization has risen 11 points in the past few years alone. In 1969, the first time Pew asked the question about legalization, only 12% of the nation was in favor. I see a revolution that is burning white hot among young people, but also shows up among the parents and grandparents in my kids' school. A police officer I met in Michigan is part of the revolution, as are the editors of the medical journal, Neurosurgery. I see it in the faces of good parents, uprooting their lives to get medicine for their children -- and in the children themselves, such as Charlotte, who went from having 300 seizures a week to just one or two a month. We know it won't consistently have such dramatic results (or any impact at all) in others, but what medicine does? I see this medical marijuana revolution in surprising places. Girl's seizures spur medical marijuana legislation in Georgia . Among my colleagues, my patients and my friends. I have even seen the revolution in my own family. A few years ago, when I told my mother I was investigating the topic for a documentary, I was met with a long pause. ""Marijuana...?"" She whispered in a half questioning, half disapproving tone. She could barely even say the word and her response filled me with self-doubt. Even as a grown man, mom can still make my cheeks turn red and shatter my confidence with a single word. But just last week she suddenly stopped mid-conversation and said, ""I am proud of you on the whole marijuana thing."" I waited for the other shoe to drop, but it didn't. Instead, she added, ""You probably helped a lot of people who were suffering."" I don't think we had ever had a conversation like that one. At that moment, I saw a revolution that can bring you to tears. The word revolution, comes from the Latin revolutio, to ""turn around."" I had my own turn around a couple of years ago, and at the time it was a lonely place to hold a supportive position on medical marijuana. Hardly any government officials would agree to sit down and be interviewed on the topic. Even patients I spoke to were reluctant to share their stories. It can be tricky, I learned, to be on the right side of science but on the wrong side of ideology. When we put the first ""Weed"" documentary on television in August 2013, I didn't know if anyone would watch our yearlong investigation. Even worse, I didn't even know if they would care. Is weed legal in your state? Just two years later, in ""Weed 3,"" we are eyewitnesses to a revolution in full swing. You will ride along with us for the dawn of the first federally approved clinical study on the use of marijuana for PTSD. You will meet patients such as Sean Kiernan, an accomplished investment banker, and Amelia Taylor, a stay-at-home mom. They are the remarkable and surprising faces of this revolution -- smart, successful and suffering -- unwilling to accept the fact that commonly prescribed medications often used to treat PTSD can be worse than the underlying disorder itself. Sean Kiernan nearly died, trying to get better. You will see what weed really does to your brain, in crystal clear images. This time around, you will hear from the heads of government agencies earnestly sharing their point of view, both Democratic and Republican senators, and even the President of the United States. This is what a revolution looks like. Your medical marijuana questions answered . When ""Weed 2: Cannabis Madness"" aired in March 2014, Boston researcher Rick Doblin believed the right people were watching. Just four days later, Doblin received a letter in the mail he had been waiting on for seven years that finally provided federal approval for his marijuana study. The federal farm where Doblin would have to obtain his marijuana is on the campus of Ole Miss in Oxford, Mississippi. In anticipation of a scientific revolution, the production of research-grade marijuana there has increased 30-fold in just the past year. Make no mistake, we have plenty of evidence that the approval and support of the federal government can fast track a revolution at a faster pace than we have yet seen. It was the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that spearheaded the research into a cure for AIDS, as well as stopping the spread of West Nile Virus. They were also responsible for the awesome task of eradicating polio and smallpox. Other successful federally backed programs include the human genome project, the BRAIN initiative and the Precision Medicine Initiative. There are no shortage of examples where the federal government has been a guardian of our public health needs, and you could argue that medical marijuana would also qualify as a worthwhile investment. 10 diseases where medical marijuana could have impact . There is now promising research into the use of marijuana that could impact tens of thousands of children and adults, including treatment for cancer, epilepsy and Alzheimer's, to name a few. With regard to pain alone, marijuana could greatly reduce the demand for narcotics and simultaneously decrease the number of accidental painkiller overdoses, which are the greatest cause of preventable death in this country. As I sat across from Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) and Cory Booker (D-New Jersey), I knew something extraordinary was happening. They were reciting the story of Charlotte Figi and countless other children. They were quoting back the data we had shared from our earlier investigations. They were extolling the potential virtues of the plant, and all of that was before the interview even started. There was an impatience about them, and they seemed in a hurry to make a large dent in marijuana reform. They want marijuana to be rescheduled. They want it now. They want doctors to be able to prescribe it at VA hospitals all over the country. They want it now. They want research dollars freed up to study the plant. They want it now. They want their fellow lawmakers at the state and national level to acknowledge what most of the world, including the citizens of the United States, have known for a long time: Marijuana is a medicine, that should be studied and treated like any other medicine. And they want all of it now. I spent much of our interview challenging them. I needed to remind them that people, long before me or them, have been trying to do many of these same things for 40 years, and had been rejected every time. I reminded them that politicians have a hard time winning elections on the issue of marijuana but less difficulty losing them. I challenged them every step of the way. ""This time will be different,"" Booker confidently told me as he walked out of the room. Is marijuana as safe as -- or safer than -- alcohol? I know how easy it is do nothing because I did nothing for too long. Take a good look at the data, educate yourself and talk to the patients, who are often out of options and find their hope in the form of a simple plant. Journalists shouldn't take a position. It makes sense. Objectivity is king. But, at some point, open questions do get answered. At some point, contentious issues do get resolved. At some point, common sense prevails. So, here it is: We should legalize medical marijuana. We should do it nationally. And, we should do it now. 9 things to know about legal pot ."

Open wide: A zoo in Ohio is celebrating the 'miracle' birth of three rare Amur tiger cubs after it was feared their mother's biological clock had stopped ticking . Bundle of joy: Keepers at the Columbus Zoo say ten-year-old Irisa had bred before but never conceived - however, this spring it was found the female cat was pregnant - with triplets . 'We are always cautiously optimistic about the survival of fragile newborns,' said Columbus Zoo president Tom Stalf. 'But the cubs seem to be thriving under the 24-hour care provided by our animal specialists and veterinarians.' Video footage shows the newborn siblings writhing around and napping. The baby cats currently weigh a healthy 2.5lbs but they're set to grow to a heftier 650lbs. Their eyes are also closed but should open over the coming days. In safe hands: While the birth on Tuesday morning went smoothly, Irisa failed to show any maternal care so her offspring are currently being hand-reared in an incubator . Taking it easy: Video footage shows the newborn siblings writhing around and napping . It is unknown when they will go on display to the public and how keepers will go about naming them. These are the first cubs for ten-year-old female, Irisa, although the Zoo team and the Tiger Species Survival Plan (SSP) had hoped for years she would reproduce and pass on her valuable genes. This is the third litter sired by 11-year-old, Foli, since 2012. Gestation for tigers is about three-and-a-half months which means the cubs were conceived just weeks before Foli left for another facility in Kansas on February 25. He has been retired from breeding. Tiny tots: They currently weigh 2.5lbs but are set to grow to a heftier 650lbs . Growing pains: Their eyes are also closed but should open over the coming days . Bright futures: It is unknown when they will go on display and how keepers will go about naming them . A new male tiger, Jupiter, arrived at the Columbus Zoo on March 19. Jupiter was born at the Moscow Zoo in 2007 and came to the Columbus Zoo from the Dvur Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic. Both males were moved at the recommendation of the Species Survival Plan in an effort to maintain a sustainable population of tigers in human care. With the addition of the three cubs there are currently ten Amur tigers at the Columbus Zoo including four cubs born in 2013 and their mother, Mara."
"The federal government is looking to take a hard line with parents who choose not to vaccinate their children. Under ground breaking reforms, Social Services Minister Scott Morrison will reportedly scrap a provision that allows parents who don't vaccinate their children to claim welfare benefits, including $726 from Family Tax Benefit A, $7,500-a-year from childcare rebate and $200-a-week from the childcare benefit scheme. Scroll down for video . The government are about to annouce reforms that will strip parents of welfare benefits if they don't immunise their kids . Newscorp reported that Prime Minister Tony Abbott will announce the reforms alongside Mr Morrison on Sunday with the changes coming into full effect in January 2016. The controversial change could put millions of dollars back into the federal government's pocket. The way the system works now, children must be immunised to access childcare payments, however,  a 'contentious loop hole' means parents can avoid loosing their benefits by simply signing a form that says they object to immunisation based on 'personal, philosophical or religious' reasons. Mr Morrison recently said the rules around welfare payments need to be 'tightened' and that while immunising children against deadly diseases protects the wider society, it should be a prerequisite to receive tax payer money. 'We've got to think about the health and well-being of all the other children that are put at risk, and it's their health that also matters' 'We've got to think about the health and well-being of all the other children that are put at risk, and it's their health that also matters,' he said. 'And in fact, you know, those parents have taken decisions to immunise their children, and that's obviously the sensible thing to do. We're a free country, and we're for free society, but that doesn't mean you get to take taxpayers' money if you don't want to go along with the rules.' While doctors and pro-vaccination groups are tipped to welcome the reforms as a way to increase the number of children being vaccinated, some immunisation experts are worried the move won't bolster immunisation rates. Currently around 39,000 children under the age of seven are not vaccinated. Currently around 39,000 Australian children under the age of seven are not vaccinated putting them at risk of catching severe diseases . Labor leader Bill Shorten's support will be vital to get the changes through the Senate however he has already indicated there will be bipartisan support for the harsh provisions. He reportedly wrote to the Prime Minister on Friday expressing his concerns over the loophole. Riley Hughes died at just 32 days old after suffering complications arising from whooping cough . These reforms come amid rising concerns about whooping cough outbreaks that have devastated small communities where many children remain unvaccinated. The heartbroken parents of a beautiful four-week-old baby boy who died after contracting whooping cough have appealed to other parents to make sure they get themselves and their children immunised against the deadly disease. Greg and Catherine Hughes, from Perth, set up a Facebook page to honour their son Riley Hughes after he 'passed away peacefully in the arms of his mummy and daddy' at 2pm on March 17, aged just 32 days. 'Our greatest desire out of our own personal tragedy is to stop parents from having to endure the heartache of preventable childhood deaths,' Riley's dad Greg wrote on the Facebook page Light for Riley. The newborn, born on February 13, died in Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital as a result of pneumonia-based complications arising from whooping cough. Whooping cough is part of the routine vaccination schedule for babies at two months, four months and six months of age. Booster doses are given at 4 years and 10-15 years. The reforms come amid rising concerns about whooping cough outbreaks that have devastated small communities where many children remain unvaccinated . Infectious Diseases Expert at ANU Medical School Canberra, Sanjaya Senanayake, told Daily Mail Australia: 'From my point of view immunisation is wonderful particularly for whooping cough.' He explained infants are 'at a high risk of dying if they get infected' and that the death rate from whooping cough in infants under 6 months of age is about 1 per cent. The Department of Health said vaccinations protect more than 95 per cent of children from measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, polio and Hib, given they finish their courses. 'One dose of meningococcal C vaccine at 12 months protects over 90 per cent of children. Three doses of whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine protects about 85 per cent of children who have been immunised, and will reduce the severity of the disease in the other 15 per cent if they do catch whooping cough.'"

""The reality is the sacrifices made by these guys [Bomber Command crews] allows for the freedom whoever is doing this has got today.""
Officials have launched a petition in a bid to get further funding from the government to complete the project."
"The SFA's performance director has been conducting a review since taking over from Mark Wotte.
Across the seven schools involved throughout Scotland, 374 children receive up to 10 hours a week specialised coaching as part of their everyday studies.
""There's been a lot of time invested in this project by a lot of people and we're looking at how we continue to improve the programme as we travel through the years,"" McClair told BBC Scotland.
The project is now in its fourth year, with this year's intake of pupils the final one of the initial scheme.
McClair will decide in the coming months whether it will continue in its current format once an analysis of how it is working has been concluded.
Alternatives could include certificating the programme to award pupils a Higher qualification for completing the course or focusing on a smaller group of children at one single, residential campus rather than the seven schools involved just now.
At the very least, the current system will continue until this year's S1 pupils have completed fourth year.
Gauging its success thus far is tricky, with the oldest participants still only in S4, but McClair believes there are some good indicators.
""I think you can be encouraged by the number of young people who have been in the performance schools who have been in the younger representative squads over the last three-and-a-bit years and the evidence suggests that will continue,"" he added.
""By summertime I think it'll be a half-decent measure of the number of young boys who are being offered the opportunity to go into full-time football, although I believe that's changing a little bit in the sense that it's 16 or 17 that some clubs are looking at taking them in full-time.
""The idea's great. Many clubs in England have taken it on board - getting kids in during the day, giving them more opportunities to practise the disciplines involved in football.
""The evidence is all there that they're improving quicker than they were previously under a hybrid programme where all the coaching was taking place in the evening or at weekends.""
The other important gauge of success is academic achievement.
Exam results will not be available from the SFA project until this summer, but Graeme High School in Falkirk ran a pilot scheme - of which Craig Sibbald and Celtic youngster Paul McMullan are graduates - that allows for some analysis.
""Last year we had a group of 14 or 15 and the vast majority were highly successful, able pupils, one with five Highers, two with four Highers, three with three Highers and a suite of other academic achievements,"" headteacher Lesley Carroll told BBC Scotland.
""Most of them have gone on to professional clubs but they have got a fallback position. They have been some of our top-performing academic pupils too because not only do they have to be elite athlete footballers, they have to have what the SFA would call a growth mindset.
""They're not afraid of targets, hard work, commitment, drive and confidence.""
Indeed, Carroll believes there is an argument the programme helps the performance school students achieve better results in their other subjects, though she admits no ""real forensic research has been done into that"".
But it will be the level of footballing development that determines exactly how McClair and the SFA proceed in terms of their future performance strategy."

"Together with her business partner Joan Murphy, each jogged with their toddlers in front of them in pushchairs.
It's this serious passion for health and fitness that brought the two then-20 somethings together when they met on a trip to Cornwall with mutual friends back in 2007.
Forming a bond over surfing, they lamented what they both saw as a lack of fun fitness options available in the UK capital.
Returning to London, they batted around business ideas during runs in Hyde Park, or over a few gins and tonics after work in the advertising industry, where both were employed. Meanwhile, weekend mornings were spent researching possible locations to open a gym.
Within a month the duo had hatched their plan to create a new type of female-friendly gym called Frame.
The aim was to run energetic and feel-good classes covering everything from dance to ""rocket yoga"", and ""dynamic Pilates"".
Their ambition was to radicalise the fitness market, which they felt was staid due to a lack of innovation.
Crux to the strategy was introducing a pay-as-you-go model, giving their customers the flexibility to drop in on classes, such dance sessions as ""Frame Rave"", ""Music Video"" and ""80s Aerobics"", without having any commitment to go to more.
Armed with a bank loan, the pair quit their jobs and launched Frame's first gym, or as they call it, ""fitness studio"", in Shoreditch, east London, in 2009.
""It was all a bit of a whirlwind,"" recalls Ms Black, 33, a former England hockey player.
""We just clicked. Joan had just returned back from New Zealand [her home country], and had looked at what was happening in the fitness industry there
""And in true Joan style she sucked me in and decided to tell me what we were going to do, which is quite useful in a business partner. I quite like that.""
Ms Murphy, 35, says Frame was unique when it started out.
""We were the first multi-disciplined pay-as you-go studio,"" she says.
""If you wanted to go to Pilates [at a studio] you had to pay up front for 10 classes. There was no fitness pay-as-you-go.
""If you didn't want to buy gym membership because you only wanted to go once or twice a week there was nothing. We wanted to put all the disciplines under one roof and make it accessible.""
However, before their venture even got off the ground, Frame faced a major setback.
Days before their Shoreditch venue was set to open, a road closure meant there was no access to the gym.
""There was no through road,"" says Ms Black. ""So we had to wait six months before opening. We had handed out flyers, recruited teachers.""
With the postponement of the fitness studio and bills mounting, they both took temporary jobs - Ms Murphy as a carer for the elderly, and Ms Black looking after children.
When Frame was eventually up and running, both got stuck into the day-to-day operations, each clocking up 30 hours a week either on reception, or as an instructor, on top of running the business.
""We were a proper start-up,"" says Ms Murphy.  ""But it wasn't just about starting a fitness business, it was what we wanted to do.""
Thanks to positive word of mouth, and some advertising, Frame's customer numbers quickly grew.
Further helped by the continuing growth of the UK health and fitness market, which according to industry figures is now worth Â£4.3bn per year, Frame has since taken out additional bank loans to open two further London outposts in Queen's Park and King's Cross.
The expanding empire has swelled Frame's turnover to Â£2.8m in 2015, up from Â£2.1m on the previous year.
Opening more gyms is now firmly on the agenda for the two ambitious women, who in December received funding from angel investors.
""We're keen to cut our teeth outside of London, and our growth plans in the long term are quite big,"" says Ms Black.
The goal is to open two new gyms per year, and mooted first locations include Brighton, Bristol and Manchester. They also currently have a month-long pop-up gym near Old Street tube station, in east London.
Frame has also tapped into other revenue streams, such as having cafes at its venues. There has also been a move into clothing, with a second sportswear collaboration with High Street fashion chain Whistles set to launch in May.
And while women remain the main focus, men can join Frame, and in fact now make up 20% of customers.
Paul Davis, a senior leisure and technology analyst at market research group Mintel, says Frame's success is down to two main reasons - its upmarket offering, and its range of classes.
""Whilst the vast majority of growth in the health and fitness club market can be attributed to the growth of the ""no-frills"" budget gym sector - city-based fitness boutiques such as Frame look to deliver an elite experience at the other end of the scale,"" he says.
""By focusing on areas outside of traditional gym activities such as dance classes and post-natal Pilates the studio appeals to a predominantly female demographic, who may not otherwise show an interest in joining a typical fitness club.""
But why the name Frame? Ms Murphy says: ""It's about a healthy, happy frame of mind, a frame out of your day.""
She adds that the company also wants people ""to move their frame with us""."
"Kenyan police have arrested five suspects in connection with Thursday's attack at Garissa University College, Interior Minister Joseph Nkaissery said Friday, according to CNN affiliate NTV. Nkaissery told reporters the university will be able to confirm Saturday if everyone has been accounted for. Thursday's attack by al-Shabaab militants killed 147 people, including 142 students, three security officers and two university security personnel. The attack left 104 people injured, including 19 who are in critical condition, Nkaissery said. During search and recovery efforts on Friday, CNN witnessed one male who was not a student hiding under a bed. That male was taken into custody and was being treated as a suspect, sources close to the search told CNN. The find sparked an additional search of the building. Sources said three people, all students, were found alive. A female student was found under a pile of bodies, another female student was hiding in a wardrobe and a male student was hiding in the bathroom, the sources confirmed to CNN. Student Hellen Titus said she survived by fooling the attackers into thinking she was dead. After gunmen shot fellow students, she smeared their blood onto her body to make it seem she'd been shot, too, she told CNN on Friday at a makeshift center for evacuated students. ""In the time of shooting,"" she said, ""they skipped me."" Most of the victims had been shot from behind, in the back of the head, a medic told CNN. ""They're facing down, always,"" a worker with St. John's ambulance service said Friday. ""They're always facing down, and they're shot in the heads, around the back."" Al-Shabaab's long, bloody legacy with Kenya . Early Thursday, an explosion and gunfire cut through the morning quiet on the campus about 90 miles (145 kilometers) from Kenya's border with Somalia, tearing many students in dormitories out of their sleep. ""Never heard anything like this,"" journalist  Dennis Okari from CNN affiliate NTV tweeted as he watched smoke rising over a student hostel. Al-Shabaab gunmen had first stormed a Christian prayer service, where they killed some and took others hostage. Then they went across campus with them, shooting non-Muslims and sparing Muslims, a witness said. They headed for the hostels. Student Japhet Mwala lay in her bed. ""We were sleeping when we heard a loud explosion that was followed by gunshots, and everyone started running for safety,"" she told Agence France-Presse. Awaking to terror: 'I am lucky to be alive' ""There are those who were not able to leave the hostels where the gunmen headed and started firing. I am lucky to be alive because I jumped through the fence with other students,"" she said. Students ran -- some crawled -- away from the gunfire, Okari said. At one point, the gunmen pinned down a building where 360 students lived, Interior Minister Joseph Nkaissery said. Okari took cover outside the campus and listened to explosions and gunfire for four hours. Kenyan security forces moved in and killed four gunmen. Somali terror group Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda affiliate, claimed responsibility for the attack. The Interior Ministry has posted a ""most wanted"" notice for a man in connection with it. It offered a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, about $215,000, for Mohamed Mohamud, who goes by the aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere. The post does not say what role the man may have played. Kenyan police are circulating ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" posters featuring eight terror suspects who are wanted in separate attacks in Kenya, the Interior Ministry said. Police are offering a bounty of more than $210,000 for the suspects, the Ministry said via Twitter. The dangerously porous border between Somalia and Kenya has made it easy for Al-Shabaab militants to cross over and carry out attacks. In a December attack at a quarry, Al-Shabaab militants separated Muslims from others and executed the non-Muslims, killing at least 36 people. In November, militants stopped a bus near the border and killed 28 people they believed to be non-Muslims. Last month, the U.S. Embassy warned of possible attacks ""throughout Kenya in the near-term"" after the reported death of a key Al-Shabaab leader, Adan Garaar, who was suspected in the September 2013 Westgate Mall attack in Nairobi. Opinion: A weakened Al-Shabaab lashes out . Police have declared a curfew for the next several days in the region from 6:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. The Education Ministry has closed the university indefinitely. Surviving students have gathered in large groups at the town's airport, waiting to be flown to their hometowns. The effects are also being felt 225 miles west in Kenya's capital of Nairobi, where the new bloodshed reinvigorated an old debate: Is the nation's security strong enough? Many thought measures taken after the Westgate Mall massacre had filled the gaps. At least 67 people died then. But Thursday's attack is the second-worst in the country's history, and it has evaporated much of the confidence won after Westgate. Civil liberty concerns had held up the enrollment of 10,000 new police recruits, but on Thursday, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta gave a directive to process them. ""Kenya badly needs additional officers,"" he said, ""and I will not keep the nation waiting."" The problems plaguing Kenya's security efforts . CNN's Christian Purefoy reported from Garissa, and CNN's Ben Brumfield wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Brian Walker, Vasco Cotovio and Lillian Leposo also contributed to this report."
"Usually a highlight of Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia, Alex Perry's name is a notable absence from the schedule in 2015. The designer revealed in February that he would not be presenting a collection at the Sydney event this week, and revealed to Daily Mail Australia on Sunday that he was enjoying 'taking a breather'. Despite this year marking the 20th anniversary of MBFWA, Perry is taking in the fashions from the comfort of the front row, after focusing on his international efforts of late. 'My team and I just need a bit of a breather - we've just finished selling in Paris, and we've had an incredible season over there, so we're busy focusing on international at the moment,' Perry told DMA at the Ellery show on first night of Fashion Week. Scroll down for video . Perry pulls out of presenting: Acclaimed designer Alex Perry opts out of showing at this year's MBFWA . 'We're busy working on Cruise too,' (Perry's popular party dress collection). 'I wouldn’t be standing here talking to you if we were showing on Monday or Tuesday,' he laughs. This is only the second Fashion Week the design powerhouse has missed in two decades. When asked if he will miss the excitement of running his own show, Perry said while he loves it, he's happy to sit back and see it from a new perspective. 'The chances I do get, I love to take in the whole thing, my eyes will be wide open as I sit in the front row,' he says. 'Because I'm not presenting a show I can really look forward to supporting some of my friends like Kym (Ellery) and Johnny (Schembri from By Johnny) they're my two faves  I'm specifically wanting to see.' Fashion favourite: Perry says Kym Ellery (pictured left) is one of his favourite designers showing this week . On Kym Ellery's show, Perry says she had a great cast of models and knew the fashion would be beautiful and all about showcasing shape and new directions. As for what he sees trending this season, Perry said the Australian market is so diverse, anything could happen. 'There are so many different designers with so many styles now, It’s not like it was 50 years ago when skirts are to the knee or something like that, there are so many handwritings, so I think it will all become really apparent after we see them this week.' 'Someone like Kym is so incredibly on point internationally at the moment which is her style, but then Johnny is going to give us some fun, sexy tight stuff.'

Model moment: Perry with Cheyenne Tozzi (pictured left) who previously starred in Australia's Next Top Model . Perry also believes the Australian market has it's on unique flair, different to fashion internationally that has a more uniform look. 'We definitely have our own signature. I wouldn't say relaxed even though people say that all the time, it’s more we have a different take on fashion. There's a mix of designers that are increadibly accomplished then there are younger designers who take more risks and challenges,' he says. 'And at the same time you can Australian designers anywhere in the world and it stands up in any country you go to and people are intrigued by it when they see girls wearing it.' Taking a break from the runway, Perry now is devoting his time to international enterprises, with a specific focus on the Asian and Middle Eastern market. Front row fashionistas: Perry  front row alongside Marie Claire's Jackie Frank (left) and Kyly Clarke (right) 'Asia is a big expansion market and the Middle East is huge, it’s had unprecedented growth in so while I’m doing stuff in Australia I’m also doing things that resonate in those regions to build brand profile in those countries.' For Perry who also is a judge on Australia's Next Top Model, this also will include more work in TV overseas. He has currently filmed production for Asia’s Next Top Model which is said to broadcast to over 11 million homes in Asia and Middle East via the Star World Network and he's also looking into more TV opportunities there but can't go into the specifics yet. Model Mogul: Perry  with Alessandra Ambrosio (left) who guest stars in this year's Australia's Next Top Model . From A-List to Asia: Perry has just filmed Asia's Next Top Model and plans to work on more TV projects in Asia . As for his fashion empire, Perry believes despite his work in TV, as well as linen and Specsaver lines, fashion is his first and foremost love and while he admits he won't stop at one thing, everything has to have synergy with his fashion brand. 'TV stuff gets a lot of press, but in reality  I’m a fashion designer  and it’s all about the credibility of clothes, so I’m really focused on that because that propels everything else.'"
"The court rejected campaigners' claims ministers were acting illegally by not suspending weapon sales to the kingdom, which is fighting a war in Yemen.
The UN claims strikes on Houthi rebels caused thousands of civilian deaths.
The government said defence exports would continue to be reviewed but the Campaign Against the Arms Trade said an appeal against the ruling was planned.
The group had claimed the UK has contravened humanitarian law, and it attacked the refusal of the Secretary of State for International Trade to suspend export licences for the sale or transfer of arms and military equipment.
Lord Justice Burnett and Mr Justice Haddon-Cave, sitting in London, said the decision to carry on the arms trade was not unlawful.
The judges said ""closed material"", which had not been made public for national security reasons, ""provides valuable additional support for the conclusion that the decisions taken by the secretary of state not to suspend or cancel arms sales to Saudi Arabia were rational"".
Equipment sold to Saudi Arabia includes Typhoon and Tornado fighter jets, as well as precision-guided bombs.
The sales contribute to thousands of engineering jobs in the UK, and have provided billions of pounds of revenue for the British arms trade.
Saudi Arabia has been supporting Yemen's internationally-recognised government after a civil war broke out in 2015.
Houthi rebels, loyal to deposed president Ali Abdullah Saleh, began an attack in 2014, forcing leader Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee the country for a time.
Since then the Saudi kingdom, and eight other mostly Sunni Arab states, have supported an air campaign aimed at restoring Mr Hadi's government.
Andrew Smith, of Campaign Against Arms Trade, said: ""This is a very disappointing verdict, and we are pursuing an appeal.
""If this verdict is upheld then it will be seen as a green light for government to continue arming and supporting brutal dictatorships and human rights abusers like Saudi Arabia that have shown a blatant disregard for international humanitarian law.
""Every day we are hearing new and horrifying stories about the humanitarian crisis that has been inflicted on the people of Yemen.""
Rosa Curling, of law firm Leigh Day, which represented the campaign group, said: ""Nothing in the open evidence, presented by the UK government to the court, suggests this risk does not exist in relation to arms to Saudi Arabia.
""Indeed, all the evidence we have seen from Yemen suggests the opposite: the risk is very real. You need only look at the devastating reality of the situation there.""
James Lynch, Amnesty International's head of arms control and human rights, said the ruling was ""deeply disappointing"".
""Irrespective of this ruling, the UK and other governments should end their shameless arms supplies to Saudi Arabia,"" he said.
""They may amount to lucrative trade deals, but the UK risks aiding and abetting these terrible crimes.""
The government said UK defence exports would continue to be ""under careful review"" to ensure they meet the standards of the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria.
""We welcome this judgment, which underscores the fact that the UK operates one of the most robust export control regimes in the world,"" a spokesperson said."
"The Very Large Array (VLA) traced the presence of ammonia in the gas giant to study the circulation systems below the visible cloud tops.
For features such as the planet's Great Red Spot - a huge storm that has raged for at least 400 years - the scientists can see something of its roots.
The observations go many tens of kilometres into the atmosphere.
""What really excites me is just the level of detail we see,"" said team-member Michael Wong from the University of California, Berkeley.
""In our maps you can see different zones, turbulent features, vortices - even the Great Red Spot.
""This has all been made possible by an upgrade to the VLA and a new technique developed by one of our co-workers,"" he told BBC News.
The Karl G Jansky Very Large Array is based in the desert of New Mexico, close to the town of Socorro.
As its name suggests, it is multi-antenna telescope.
The upgrade Dr Wong is referring to has made the facility a far more sensitive tool for studying the radio emissions coming from objects in space.
And the new technique he mentions counters the smearing effect you would ordinarily expect to get if you took a long exposure of a rapidly rotating body (Jupiter's ""day"" lasts just 10 hours).
The result is a wonderfully detailed impression of what is happening under the immediate surface of the many-banded weather systems that race across the top of planet's atmosphere.
The team looks at the glow of ammonia because it is a tracer for the dynamical flow in the planet's gases, which are dominated by hydrogen and helium. At Earth, you might do something similar by using water as the tracer.
""We see the actual glow of the ammonia itself, and the variation in depth is correlated with brightness,"" explained Dr Wong.
""The deepest we can see in this dataset is about 12 Bar - 12 times the Earth's atmospheric pressure.""
Plumes of ammonia are observed to rise up in waves. The team writes in the journal Science that the ammonia in these plumes will eventually condense out at higher altitudes, and could explain the ammonia ice clouds detected by the Galileo spacecraft in the 1990s.
""All told, there is a wealth of information about the structure of Jupiter's atmosphere in these new VLA images,"" said Imke de Pater, the lead author on the Science paper.
""We hope to resolve a number of outstanding questions with these and future studies using similar techniques."" Prof de Pater wants to try similar observations at the gas giants Saturn and Uranus.
The research is a nice prelude to the next probe set to visit Jupiter: the US space agency satellite Juno arrives at the enormous planet on 4 July.
Its remote sensing instruments aim to characterise the full internal structure of the planet, right down to its rocky core - if indeed it has one.

"David Cameron took on Church of England bishops yesterday after they questioned the morality of his austerity and welfare policies. In an Easter message to Christians, the Prime Minister insisted the Coalition had spent five years ‘trying to lift people up’ by making work pay and encouraging responsibility. ‘Just because some people have disagreed with our policies, does not mean those policies are missing in moral content,’ he insisted. Scroll down for video . Trip with George: Prime Minister David Cameron visited Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton yesterday . Statement: In an Easter message to Christians, the Prime Minister insisted the coalition had spent five years 'trying to lift people up' by making work pay and encouraging responsibility . His intervention came as another senior Tory, chief whip Michael Gove, claimed Christians in Britain were being dismissed with a combination of condescension and suspicion. Six weeks ago, the Church provoked a row with ministers by publishing an unprecedented guide to how the country’s 30million Christians should ‘approach the General Election’. Bishops insisted it was not targeted at any particular party, and criticised successive governments while calling for a ‘fresh moral vision’. But much of the 50-page document was widely interpreted as indirect criticism of the Coalition’s welfare policies, which include a £26,000-a-year cap on household benefits, a new universal credit designed to ensure people are always better off in work and tough sanctions to prevent people languishing on jobless benefits. The bishops complained that welfare claimants were ‘described in terms that imply they are undeserving, dependent and ought to be self-sufficient’. They insisted it was ‘game-playing … to claim that anyone who cares about the impact of austerity on the most vulnerable members of society is… careless about the extent of national indebtedness’. The Archbishop of Canterbury the Most Rev Justin Welby - pictured ahead of a service for the re-burial of Richard III at Leicester Cathedral last week - has seen the Church of England come under fire from the PM . Despite evidence that the best-off are paying more in tax than ever before, the bishops also complained that ‘the greatest burdens of austerity have not been borne by those with the broadest shoulders’. Official Treasury figures suggest that the richest 10 per cent of households are contributing most to deficit reduction. Archbishop of York John Sentamu blamed welfare cuts and 'poverty wages' for rising inequality . Speaking to Premier Christianity magazine, Mr Cameron said the ‘values of the Christian faith are the values on which our nation was built’. ‘I’m an unapologetic supporter of the role of faith in this country. And for me, the key point is this: the values of Easter and the Christian religion – compassion, forgiveness, kindness, hard work and responsibility – are values that we can all celebrate and share,’ he added. Mr Cameron conceded he was not a model Christian and was ‘a bit hazy on the finer points of our faith’. ‘But even so, in the toughest of times, my faith has helped me move on and drive forward. It also gives me a gentle reminder every once in a while about what really matters and how to be a better person, father and citizen,’ he added. The Prime Minister said he had attempted to ‘banish the notion that being in government means you can somehow wave a magic wand and solve all the world’s problems’, and instead it was about ‘the right judgement… based on clear values and beliefs’. He said the Government had inherited ‘exceptional pressure on the national finances’ from Labour, adding: ‘I am proud that despite the pressure on public spending, we made clear choices to help the poorest paid and most vulnerable in society. ‘We have increased NHS spending, despite the overriding need to deal with the deficit. We also raised the threshold of income tax to lift the poorest paid out of income tax altogether. ‘More fundamentally, the core of our recovery programme – dealing with the deficit to restore confidence in our economy – is based on enduring ideas and principles: hard work, fair play, rewarding people for doing the right thing, and securing a better future for our children.’ Writing in The Spectator magazine today, Mr Gove said that the popular image of Christianity was at odds with the reality of churches across the country, which daily offered ‘thousands of quiet kindnesses’ to those most in need. ‘To call yourself a Christian in contemporary Britain is to invite pity, condescension or cool dismissal.’ Nick Clegg is on course to lose his seat to Labour, a poll suggested yesterday. A survey of voters in the Lib Dem leader’s Sheffield Hallam constituency put Labour on 36 per cent of the vote compared with 34 per cent for the Liberal Democrats. Prime Minister's wife: Samantha Cameron arrives for a visit to Abbey Court School in Rainham, Kent . Samantha Cameron yesterday visited a primary school in the seat of Rochester and Strood, held by former Tory Mark Reckless, who defected to Ukip and won a by-election last year. Despite his victory, the Conservatives are hopeful of recapturing the seat at the General Election. Reckless’s party Ukip, meanwhile, has said 16 and 17-year-olds should not be allowed to vote in a referendum on membership of the European Union. Its deputy chairman claims children are being exposed to ‘propaganda’ from Brussels in a bid to ‘catch them young’. Suzanne Evans said: ‘It’s everything there from colouring-in books on the Common Agricultural Policy for primary schoolchildren right up to research projects at university level. ‘The amount of money that the EU is putting into this propaganda and throughout the entire education system is enormous. 'Overall the EU has an advertising budget that is larger than Coca-Cola.’ It is thought the Lib Dems would demand 16 and 17-year-olds are given a say in any EU referendum as part of a post-election coalition deal."
"To allay possible concerns, Boston prosecutors released video Friday of the shooting of a police officer last month that resulted in the killing of the gunman. The officer wounded, John Moynihan, is white. Angelo West, the gunman shot to death by officers, was black. After the shooting, community leaders in the predominantly African-American neighborhood of Roxbury, where the shooting occurred, were quick to call for calm. One said the officers were forced to return fire. Still, they were glad to see the video released for the sake of transparency. ""I think people understand that the decisions Mr. West made put his life in grave jeopardy,"" clergyman Mark V. Scott told CNN affiliate WCVB. West had several prior gun convictions, police said. Moynihan is a former U.S. Army Ranger who was honored at the White House for his heroism in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing. The ""Top Cop"" helped save a transit officer wounded in a gunbattle with the bombers. Last month, he became a gunshot victim when he and other officers in unmarked cars, but with blue lights flashing, stopped the car West was driving. When Moynihan opened the driver's-side door, the video shows, West sprang out and fired a shot with a pistol at the officer's face. As West ran away, he fired back at the other officers with his .357 Magnum handgun, police said. They returned fire and killed him. Moynihan, 34, survived with a bullet wound under one eye. He was placed in a medically induced coma at a Boston hospital. On Saturday, Moynihan was released from the hospital. ""His condition is best described as serious but improving,"" Boston police said in a statement. ""In the days after the shooting, John and his family have been strengthened, humbled and inspired by the outpouring of love and support they've received -- not only from his closest friends and fellow officers -- but also from concerned citizens and strangers from all over the country wishing him a full and speedy recovery."" A woman who was driving by at the time of the shooting suffered a flesh wound in the right arm. She was not identified. Two passengers in the car were arrested on unrelated charges involving an outstanding warrant and a probation violation. ""None of our officers like to use their firearms,""  Police Commissioner William Evans said at the time. ""It's probably the worst thing we have to do in our profession, but here, clearly unprovoked, one of our officers is shot point-blank in the face."" In April 2013, Moynihan was among officers who helped save transit officer Richard H. Donohue Jr., who was shot during a gunfight involving Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the days after the marathon bombings. In the battle, police fired nearly 300 rounds within five to 10 minutes. Moynihan and other Massachusetts officers were cited for their ""heroic and relentless"" life-saving measures on Donohue, who nearly lost his entire blood volume on the Watertown street. At a White House ceremony in May, President Barack Obama honored Moynihan and 52 other officers as ""America's Top Cops."" After Moynihan was wounded and West killed, police and and local leaders sought to allay community concerns at a time when officer-involved shootings have led to protests throughout the nation. Scott, of the Black Ministerial Alliance of Greater Boston, said Moynihan was shot ""assassination-style."" He called for calm in Roxbury. ""This is not about 'Black Lives Matter,' "" he said, referring to a protest movement that emerged after the shootings. ""It's about 'All Lives in the Community Matter,' and it's about the police ... responding to a concern from the community."" CNN's Ann O'Neill contributed to this report."
"Hamilton has triumphed in all three races since retiring from the season-opener in Australia, which Rosberg won.
Rosberg said: ""Every weekend is crucial but the results momentum is on his side and I need to try to turn it around.
""Definitely that is the case. I have come here to win, to try to extend the lead in the championship.""
Lewis Hamilton has completed 169 racing laps out of a possible 224 this year (following his retirement from the Australian GP). Of those, he has spent 164 in the lead (97%).
Hamilton is four points behind his team-mate in the drivers' standings and the Mercedes car has such a performance advantage that the two are effectively competing for wins only with each other at every race.
Hamilton said: ""This is a much more intense season so far and perfection is required every weekend to get that result, especially when you have a good team-mate who is also doing an exceptional job.""
Hamilton has out-qualified Rosberg in three of the four races so far this season, each time when there was a wet qualifying session.
Rosberg said: ""What I need is a normal weekend and then I'm sure I'll be able to turn things around.""
Both men said they expected the nature of Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya could mean they face a tougher challenge from their rivals than has been the case so far.
Long, demanding corners predominate at the track, which is renowned as one of the severest tests of a car's aerodynamic capabilities on the Formula 1 calendar.
The competitive order may also shift as Barcelona is a race where teams traditionally bring their first big upgrade package of the year.
Hamilton said: ""It depends what step they make but the Red Bulls are at the back of my mind.
""They have perhaps a little more downforce than us, they just don't have as much power.
""This is very much a downforce-dependent circuit, so you'll get a real good indication of how good their car is.""
Alonso finished third in the last race in China after a troubled start to the season for Ferrari, but said he would not start the weekend of his home race expecting to repeat that result.
""We will do our best but we know it will be a tough weekend. Today, sitting here, if I tell you I will fight for the podium, I would lie to you and I don't want to do that for all the people coming,"" said the 32-year-old, a hero for the tens of thousands of Spanish fans who flock to the race.
Four-time champion Vettel, who has been beaten by team-mate Daniel Ricciardo in the last two races and is struggling to adapt to the new Red Bull, said: ""Mercedes are in a very strong position. They are difficult to beat, but it's never impossible.
""At the moment there are a couple of things we need to get on top of and then it should be a different story.""

"A 14-year-old girl has died and her mother has been left severely injured after they were thrown off a moving bus following a sexual assault in India. Arshdeep Kaur and her mother Shinder, were travelling from their home in Punjab, northern India, to visit relatives when a group of about half a dozen men began harassing them. The men grabbed Arshdeep and made several attempts to 'molest' her and her mother, but instead of defending them, the bus staff joined in the sexual assault. Scroll down for video . Victims: Arshdeep Kaur, 14, and her mother Shinder, pictured in hospital, were travelling from their home in Punjab, northern India,  when passengers and bus staff sexually assaulted them . The incident took place on a near-empty bus near Moga, some 50 miles from the Pakistani border, in Punjab province. Mrs Kaur, 38, daughter Arshdeep, 14, and son Akashdeep Singh, had taken the bus from their home village to visit Mrs Kaur's parents, Tribune India reports. Shortly after boarding the bus, a group of men had surrounded mother and daughter and tried to grab both of them. Mrs Kaur alerted the conductor about the harassment, he joined in and started abusing them both. After fighting off her attackers, Mrs Kaur ran through the bus to tell the driver to stop the bus, but according to her testimony, he started driving faster. The incident took place on a near-empty bus near Moga, some 50 miles from the Pakistani border, in Punjab province . Vital issue: Officials recently banned a documentary about the 2012 gang rape and murder of an 23-year-old student in Delhi (stock image) The assault continued until the bus slowed down and mother and daughter could break free, however as they attempted to get off the bus, Mrs Kaur says they were pushed. Arshdeep and Mrs Kaur both suffered serious injuries, and the 14-year-old later died in hospital. 'No one helped. They first pushed my daughter off the bus, then me,' Mrs Kaur told NDTV from her hospital bed today. Shortly after the pair had been pushed off, the bus stopped by the roadside and the alleged perpetrators, including the conductor, cleaner and driver fled the scene. The three could later be apprehended and police have launched an investigation into the incident. There has a heightened sensitivity to the issue of sexual assault in India in recent weeks after officials banned a documentary about the 2012 gang rape and murder of an Indian student in Delhi. Officials said the documentary, called India's Daughter, would cause further disorder if it was shown, following a number of protests and incidents of vigilante justice in the country. The documentary explained the brutal rape and murder of 23-year-old student Jyoti Singh, who was attacked on a bus when she returned home from the cinema. One of the six men convicted of the attack, bus driver Mukesh Singh, was interviewed in prison and told researchers that had Jyoti not fought back she would not have been killed. Her death led to protests throughout India and outraged the world. Jyoti Singh Pandey, a physiotherapy student, was gang raped as she travelled on a bus. The 23-year-old suffered in hospital for 13 days from her injuries before she died. Vinay Sharma, 20, Akshay Thakur, 28, Pawan Gupta, 19, and Mukesh Singh, 26, were all sentenced to death for her rape. Ram Singh, co-accused and widely considered the leader of the group, was found dead in his cell. A minor also found guilty was sentenced to three years in a reformatory institution. Her death sparked angry protests in India and internationally about misogyny in the country. The attention forced judges to prioritise the case and the lawyer's association in Saket reportedly refused to defend the perpetrators."
"Demi Moore may be about to boost her fortune, but not because of any new film contract. The actress is selling the Manhattan penthouse she once shared with ex-husband Bruce Willis with an asking price of $75million which is exactly half of her total estimated fortune of $150million. And if the penthouse sells for that much, it will break the record for the most expensive co-op apartment ever sold on the Upper West Side. Moore and Willis purchased the south tower penthouse on the 28th floor of the historic San Remo apartment building in 1990 from Saturday Night Fever producer Robert Stigwood, in addition to a two-bedroom maisonette on the lobby floor. Scroll down for video . Moving out: Demi Moore is selling the Manhattan penthouse apartment she once shared with ex-husband Bruce Willis for a $75million asking price . 'We looked at everything on the park, Fifth Avenue, Central Park South and Central Park West, and there was just nothing like it,' Moore told the New York Times of her house search. 'The location, architecture and history of the San Remo were on a completely different level.' The 14-bedroom apartment includes a 7,000 square feet of living space and wrap around terraces with views of both Central Park and the Hudson River. The couple decorated the mansion in the skies in a Southwestern mission motif, complete with cherry wood detailing and a ceramic tile fireplace. New windows have been installed in every room, the bathrooms remolded and state-of-the-art equipment like a sub-zero refrigerator and viking range installed in the kitchen.

In the living room, the focal point are the windows which look out onto the boat pond in Central Park. The San Remo was designed in 1929 by American architect Emery Roth, and it was turned into a co-op in 1972. Over the years, Moore has counted Dustin Hoffman, Diane Keaton, Steven Spielberg as neighbors - not to mention U2 frontman Bono who occupies the north tower penthouse. Moore says she is selling the apartment and maisonette since she doesn't spend much time at the residence anymore. Adam D Modlin, president of the Modlin Group, is in charge of the listing and says there is no other apartment in the neighborhood to rival Moore's. 'Compared with the other iconic private perches on the perimeter of Central Park, there just isn’t anything quite like this penthouse,' he said. 'It is the grandest residence in the south tower, the one that sits above all the others, a mansion in the clouds, and it is the largest intact park-facing residence at the San Remo with private outdoor space.' Moore and Willis were married from 1987 until 2000 and share three daughters. The combined monthly maintenance fees for both residences is more than $20,000."
"State Education Minister Adrian Piccoli has called the Scot's College university shortcut 'unfair,' after it was released that school students could buy their way into university without completing their HSC. Tuition, sporting and curricula fees for Scot's College, one of Sydney's most prestigious schools, reportedly top $30,000 . The University of Sydney have been running a 17-week diploma for Year 11 students at Scot's College to skip their year 12 exams and 'buy' their entry into the sandstone university. 'Access to university should be fair and equitable,' Mr Piccoli told Fairfax Media. 'Any scheme that gives some students an unfair advantage is unacceptable and I will be discussing this with the federal government, which is responsible for universities.' Eight Scot's students gained 'direct entry' to the university after completing the program in 2014, according to a letter sent to parents by principal Dr Ian Lambert, while 166 students completed the HSC. The program was devised by the university's commercial arm, Sydney Learning, and students who completed the course successfully were guaranteed places in a number of undergraduate level courses, including bachelor degrees in health sciences, liberal arts and science, animal and veterinary bioscience, visual arts, music and oral health, or in a diploma of law. Opposition leader Luke Foley is concerned over how this alternative would impact the HSC. 'We have a federal Coalition government intent on linking university admission to wealth, more and more, and these are the sorts of arrangements that flow from the Abbott government's reform of our higher education sector,' he said. The Sydney Morning Herald have reported that concern within the University of Sydney staff has led to its academic board shutting down this alternative pathway for school students. Sandstone halls: The University of Sydney's commercial arm, Sydney Learning, has run the pilot program with Scot's College. Pictured above is the university's clocktower and the eastern range of its main building precinct . However, at the time it was shutdown, the board was unaware that Scot's College were planning the pilot with another 11 boys this year. My Foley is worried that this pathway will be picked up by other universities and elite high schools. Scot's College does not advertise their fees for tuition, sport and other curriculum activities, but in 2013 they were reported to be $30,900 per year with an extra $24,121 for boarders. Scot's College: Dr Lambert, the college's chief, was quoted telling the Sydney Morning Herald that the diploma was designed with students 'in the middle rank of learners' in mind . Rose Steele, the president of the National Union of Students, told Daily Mail Australia that while it was important there were alternative pathways available for students to gain entry to university, it was 'really concerning' if this program was only open to students who could afford it. 'NUS really believes education should be open to all and not just those who can afford it,' Ms Steele said. Daily Mail Australia approached the University of Sydney and Scot's College for comment on Monday morning. Principal Ian Lambert has rejected the notion that it was an exclusive deal for Scot's College. He agrees that the current HSC grading system works for the top 20 percent of students, but not for middle-ranking students. Do you know more? Daniel.Piotrowski@mailonline.com ."
"Two college students have been charged in connection to an unconscious girl who was allegedly gang raped on a Florida beach during Spring Break in broad daylight, authorities said. Troy University students Delonte' Martistee, 22, of Georgia and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, of Alabama were charged on Friday with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators relating to the incident that occurred between March 10-12, according to Bay County Sheriff's Office. According to WFSA, it has been confirmed by university officials that both men were suspended, and Martistee, a promising track star, has been removed from the team. The alleged victim  told deputies she thought she had been drugged before the incident and that she was afraid to report it because she could not remember many details, Panama City News Herald reported. Scroll down for video . Delonte' Martistee, 22, (left) and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, (right) have been charged in connection with the alleged rape after police in Troy, Alabama, found the clip on a cell phone during another investigation . Martistee of Bainbridge, Georgia is a promising track star at Troy University according to officials, but he has since been removed from the team . Calhoun of Mobile, Alabama was suspended from Troy University along with Martistee, university officials confirmed . 'She knows something happened, but she doesn't know what happened,' Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said. Authorities  are still searching for two additional suspects in the case. Friday's charges stem from a video police found where hundreds of people are seen watching the incident without attempting to intervene during the alleged attack on Panama City Beach, authorities claim. The footage was uncovered on a cell phone during an unconnected investigation into a shooting in Troy, Alabama. Alerting the Bay County Sheriff's Office, the two departments worked together to identify two suspects and the alleged victim. McKeithen branded the video the 'most disgusting, sickening thing' and likened the scene to 'wild animals preying on a carcass laying in the woods'. Following the incident that occurred between March 10-12, the men were arrested and charged on Friday and were taken to the Bay County Jail as they await their first appearance . In the video, McKeithen said one man is heard in the clip saying, 'she isn't going to know,' before putting his hand inside her bikini bottoms. The incapacitated young woman is surrounded by several men while seated on a beach chair during the video filmed behind Spinnaker Beach Club. McKeithen told a press conference: 'This is happening in broad daylight with hundreds of people seeing and hearing what is happening and they are more concerned about spilling their beer than somebody being raped. 'This is such a traumatizing event for this girl. No one should have to fear this would happen in Panama City Beach, but it does.' Authorities said hundreds of people walked past but did not stop the attack near Spinnaker Beach Club on Panama City Beach, Florida, in broad daylight during a Spring Break party last month . The sheriff's office said it has encountered incidents like this before through leads found on social media. In one video, police said a crowd pours beer on a girl who appears to be incapacitated while a male performs a sexual act on her. And recently, officers took inventory of the guns and drugs recovered during Spring Break this year which included marijuana, MDMA, cocaine, heroin as well as 49 handguns - which increased from nine last year. This most recent alleged sexual attack and the arrests made on Friday have served as a tipping point for the Bay County Sheriff's Office. McKeithen touted laws during Spring Break such as banning drinking on the beach and parking lots as well as clubs not being able to allow non-military people under 21 to enter. He said he will fight to have even more strict Spring Break regulations in the coming year. 'This draws the line in the sand for us,' he said. 'It is not safe for our children on the beach... If you condone this behavior, you should be in jail, as far as I'm concerned.' The investigation related to the incident is ongoing."

The first LPTs to launch will be based in Lurgan and Armagh city police stations in County Armagh. They will be supported by four mobile neighbourhood policing teams (NPTs).
The roll-out of all 26 LPTs is expected to be completed by 1 October.
Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin said policing in Northern Ireland is in a process of ""transformation"" due to ""significant budget pressures"" and new council structures.
He said ""normal policing will carry on"" and the new teams will respond to calls, conduct investigations, and ""deal with community problems"".
""They will provide advice and reassurance and spend time learning about what most affects communities in order to work with them to improve safety and quality of life,"" he said.
The 34 NPTs, which will be based in areas with higher levels of crime and deprivation, are to be set up with the aim of providing ""an additional dedicated policing presence, reassurance and commitment to communities where it is most needed"".
ACC Martin said restructuring means the number of police stations currently in existence is under review.
""The reality is that nearly all policing services are delivered outside of stations,"" he added.
""Policing isn't about buildings it is about officers working with the community in the community."""
"Police added attempted murder to the list of charges against the mother of a quadriplegic man who was left in the woods for days, Philadelphia police spokeswoman Christine O'Brien said Tuesday. Nyia Parler cannot be extradited to face the charges in Philadelphia until she completes an unspecified ""treatment,"" Maryland police said Monday. When she does arrive, she will be charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person and related offenses, in addition to the attempted murder count, O'Brien said. The Montgomery County (Maryland) Department of Police took Parler, 41, into custody Sunday after Philadelphia police reported that she left her 21-year-old son in the woods while she hopped a bus to see her boyfriend in Maryland. A man walking through the woods found him Friday ""lying in leaves, covered in a blanket with a Bible and a wheelchair nearby,"" Philadelphia police say. Citing federal health care privacy laws, Montgomery County police spokesman Capt. Paul Starks said he could not divulge why Parler was receiving treatment, but he said she had to complete it before she could be extradited. She remained in treatment as of Tuesday morning, Starks told CNN. If she chooses not to challenge her extradition, she will be transported to Philadelphia once the treatment is complete, he said. For more than four days, police say, the quadriplegic man, who also suffers from cerebral palsy, was left lying in the woods of Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek Park. Low temperatures reached the mid-30s during the week, and rain was reported in the area Wednesday and Thursday. The man is unable to communicate how he came to be in the park, but Philadelphia police Lt. John Walker told reporters that the man's mother left him there the morning of April 6. Starks identified the mother as Parler on Monday. ""The mother went to visit her boyfriend down in Maryland, over in Montgomery County, and we believe she placed the child into Cobbs Creeks Park,"" Walker said at a news conference. Walker told CNN the man was transported to Presbyterian Hospital, but CNN affiliates reported he was being treated at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He suffered eye problems, dehydration, malnutrition and a cut to his back that raised infection concerns, the lieutenant told reporters. ""This kid's obviously a fighter,"" Walker said during a Saturday news conference. ""It's just unbelievable how we found him out there last night. To see that kid laying there, it's heartbreaking to see another human, especially a mother, can treat someone like that."" Officials at Philadelphia's School of the Future, which the man attends, became concerned when he didn't show up for classes last week and tried to contact his mother but eventually reached an aunt, Philadelphia police said. ""The aunt was in contact via text message with Nyia throughout the week and when she expressed her concerns about the complainant, Nyia replied, 'We're OK,' which the aunt believed meant that the victim was with Nyia in Maryland,"" according to a police news release. When police tracked down the mother, she told them her son was with her, Walker said. ""She indicated to both family members and the police officers that the child was with her down with her boyfriend in Maryland,"" he said. The boyfriend was not aware of what happened, Walker told CNN affiliate KYW-TV. Walker told reporters she bore ""clear criminal liability in this case."" There was no reason for the man to suffer, Walker told philly.com, because the mother had sisters willing to take care of him. Two of his aunts, who have tried to obtain guardianship of him, were staying with him at the hospital, police told the website. Parler's sister told police that Parler has another child, a 16-year-old. The mother's arrest was only the beginning of the investigation, Walker told reporters. Authorities are interested in learning more about ""how this kid was cared for, and what actions were taken and providing of services by different agencies."" CNN's Chuck Johnston and Carma Hassan contributed to this report."

"A 23-month-old girl in  died after her father struck her with a pickup truck when he didn't see that she was in the driveway, police have said said. Police were called to the scene in the North Las Vegas neighborhood at about 11.30am on Thursday, police spokesman Aaron Patty said. The father, 24, and other family members inside did not know that the toddler, who later died at University Medical Hospital, had gotten out of the house and on to the driveway, police said. A 23-month-old toddler was killed after her father, who didn't know she was in the driveway, struck her with a pickup truck just days before her second birthday . The father and other family members say that they did not know the toddler was in the driveway. The incident was deemed an accident . The incident was deemed an accident and no charges will be filed, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The girl was going to turn two this weekend, according to KLAS.

"But they have no need to do that now.
O'Neill is taking his side into a Euro 2016 clash with the world champions in Paris with a place in the competition's knockout stage at stake.
As he told the Irish Times, he needed to hitch-hike with some Germans during a scouting trip to Euro 2012, shortly after he had taken the job.
But he doesn't plan on returning any favours this time around.
O'Neill's and a friend went to the last European Championships in Poland and Ukraine to cast an eye over Portugal and Russia, who would be among Northern Ireland's opponents in their qualifying group for the 2014 World Cup.
He said they rented a car in Poland and but were not allowed to take it out of the country, which caused them a problem when they went to cross the border into Ukraine.
Crossing the Irish border is much easier than venturing between the two eastern European countries, he said, but German fans were on hand to help out.
""That border's not like Newry is today, there were checkpoints and all that,"" he said.
""We had a brainwave when we saw this bus with Germany fans - lots of people were staying in Poland and going across to Ukraine,"" he explained.
He ""approached this wee bus"" and soon they were on their way to the Ukrainian city of Lviv.
""My mate tried to explain what we were doing and who I was, so that we could get on,"" he said.
""They didn't know who I was, I was only in the job about six months, so when we got on they started to Google me and 'Northern Ireland manager' to see who I was.
""I didn't have accreditation or anything, we just wanted to go on our own steam.""
O'Neill said he ""wanted to go to the tournament and see what it's about"" from a fan's point of view.
""I wanted to see Russia and Portugal and I saw them both twice,"" he said.
But now he and his team are making an impact at the tournament for real - a win against Ukraine in Lyon last week means they are within touching distance of extending their stay in France.
""We belong in this tournament,"" he said.
""I sampled that one, now we're in this one and we're part of it.""
One thing is for certain - if O'Neill leads Northern Ireland to a shock result over Joachim Low's global stars on Tuesday, his stock will only rise higher.
And no German fan will never need to Google his name again."
"There are up to one million free-roaming dogs on Romania's streets who are being hunted down by 'dog catchers' and stuck in squalid state-run pounds where 'they are waiting to die'. The 'euthanasia' of strays was legalised by the Romanian parliament in September 2013 to help reduce a massive overpopulation. But a group of former models called the K-9 Angels have rescued hundreds of  dogs from the streets where they would be savagely killed - and re-homed at least 700 in the UK. The Angels claim government funds for programmes aimed at neutering the animals were never implemented and the animals were dealt with in the 'most cruel way'. Pola Pospieszalska, Anneka Svenska and former Playboy model Victoria Eisermann are devoted to saving the mistreated dogs - and finding them loving homes. Scroll down for videos . The K-9 Angels charity fronted by singer Pola Pospieszalska (left), TV wildlife presenter Anneka Svenska (right) and former Playboy model Victoria Eisermann (centre) is devoted to saving the mistreated dogs . Rescue: The K-9 Angels (Pola pictured) have rescued hundreds of stray dogs from being killed in Romania and re-homed them in the UK . Second chance: Pola, Anneka and Victoria (pictured) have re-homed at least 700 dogs in the UK and spayed over 2,500 dogs . Overpopulation: Charities estimate there are between 500,000 and one million free-roaming dogs on Romania's streets . Cruelty: Pola described to MailOnline how 'tens of thousands of animals have been caught by dogcatchers (pictured) and killed in most horrific ways' Inhumane: The dogs are supposed to be euthanised humanely with a legal injection but in reality they can be clubbed to death, set on fire and left for dead . Abandoned: Charities have told MailOnline that state-appointed 'dog catchers' are rounding up dogs and taking them to holding pens where they are 'waiting to die' Attack: Pola from K-9 Angels (pictured) she says the 'killing law' was passed following an 'isolated incident' in 2013, when a four-year-old boy was mauled to death by a pack of 'vicious stray dogs' Brutal: The Angels claim government funds for programmes which were designed to neuter dogs were never implemented and the animals were dealt with in the 'most cruel way' They say the state-appointed catchers round up dogs and take them to holding pens where they can be 'clubbed to death' and set on fire. Pola told MailOnline: 'Romania's stray dog situation is probably one of the worst in Europe and sad, neglected, hungry animals are a part of Romanian landscape. She says the 'killing law' was passed following an 'isolated incident' in 2013, when a four-year-old boy was mauled to death by a pack of 'vicious stray dogs'. Adding: 'Tens of thousands of animals have been caught by dogcatchers and killed in most horrific ways. 'It is common in Romania for them not to use a euthanasia injection, but instead dispose of dogs in cheaper ways such as injecting paint thinner into the heart, strangling, clubbing to death.' The founders of K-9 Angels describe the pounds as 'filthy, dirty, short on food'  and in truth - just a place to dump these dogs so they die away from the public'. Here, the dogs suffer from mange - a skin disease caused by parasitic mites - and fights between them erupt regularly. Despite the harsh conditions they are subjected to, the animals who are lucky enough to be alive still vie for the Angels' affection when they are eventually rescued. Animal charity Four Paws - which has helped neuter around 150,000 stray dogs - says the situation for dogs became much worse when the killing law was introduced. Its spokesperson Adam Rahman told MailOnline: 'Dogs are brutally rounded up by dog catchers and taken to pounds where they are subjected to poor conditions and cruel treatment, and are essentially waiting to be killed. 'The organisation responsible for catching the dogs estimated that they had captured around 25,000 stray dogs in Bucharest alone since the legislation was passed, and overseen the killing of around 16,000.' The organisation successfully convinced the Bucharest Court of Appeal to suspend the legislation last summer, but they say the brutal situation on the streets remains the same. Killing: The Romanian government implemented the culling programme to stem the overpopulation of stray dogs but a WHO report says killing the animals will not solve the problem . Humane: Victoria (pictured) and the K-9 Angels have so far re-home at least 700 dogs in the UK and spayed thousands more . Change: Their Kent-based charity's website is full of pictures of once-doomed dogs who have found happy homes in the UK . Inspiration: The Angels were formed when Anneka (left) saw of a picture of a desperate Romanian stray on Facebook and decided to do help with her friends Pola and Victoria (right) Found: Like the Angels, charity League of Rescue has also rescued hundreds of stray dogs like Tommy (pictured) from Romania's streets . Happy home: Tommy - who was found malnourished in the back of a rundown car - is now living comfortably in the UK . Desperate: They also found Mabel (pictured) at a train station in an appalling condition and a severe wound on her left paw . Happy ending: Mabel - whose leg was crushed - is one of the lucky ones to be rescued but 16,000 dogs have been culled since it was legalised at the end of 2013 . Inspired: The K-9 Angels were forged when TV wildlife presenter Anneka saw a photograph of a desperate stray dog on the streets of Romania on Facebook . Earlier this month, the charity found evidence of a massive and illegal cull of stray dogs in the small southern town of Clinceni. They discovered dozens of dead dogs with visible wounds on their heads and bodies left to rot in black bags in the forest. 'This is another serious violation of the law on stray animals and proof that, although the killing law has been repealed since June 20, 2014,' Four Paws said. The cull is supposed to reduce the overpopulation of stray dogs in the country but a World Health Organisation report claimed: 'In none of the study areas did the elimination of dogs by any method (catching, shooting or other) have any significant long-term effect on dog population size.' The K-9 Angels were forged when TV wildlife presenter Anneka saw a photograph of a desperate stray dog on the streets of Romania on Facebook. It was the plight of that dog - named Angel - that inspired the trio to officially form the organisation in November 2011. Their petition to calling on the European Union to investigate the 'disappearance' of the public funds designated for a neutering programme has gained over 28,000 signatures. Gruesome: Charity Four Paws discovered dozens of dogs with severe wounds to their head and bodies in the a southern Romanian town . Grotesque: While another charity Dog Rescue Romani claim to see piles of dead dogs left on village roads . A rescue worker with Dog Rescue Romani said they regularly see piles of dead dogs left in the middle of village roads when they patrol the south-west of Romania. Its spokesperson Marius Costache told MailOnline: 'The scenes are such that alive dogs and some puppies were eating from the other dead dogs within the pile. 'We asked someone who said they saw a large truck passing by at 3.30am that night who dumped the pile and left. 'We called our local police right at that moment and the answer was 'so what do you want us to do?' 'With the euthanasia law or without, it the slaughter in Romania public shelters or streets will continue.' Between March and May 2014, a team of investigators from Four Paws investigated 43 public shelters in Romania – from around 81 currently registered with the Romanian vet authorities. The results of the investigation were shocking  as they found that not one of these public shelters in Romania conformed to the law regulating the national programme on stray dogs."
"An unknown illustrator who films her every move and interacts with strangers for hours at a time has become one of the internet's biggest celebrities - and she's only been online for 29 days. Amanda Oleander, 25, is one of the stars of Periscope, Twitter's new live broadcasting platform and has been 'loved' over 7.5 million times in less than a month since it launched. Branded the Kim Kardashian of the social platform, when the brunette starts a live stream, thousands of Periscope users around the globe stop what they're doing to watch. Scroll down for video . Amanda Orleander, broadcasting live from her bedroom, is the emerging star of Periscope . In a recent broadcast, Amanda addressed her audience via her iPhone from her LA bedroom: 'Do you know the power that we have? Do you guys understand what is happening. 'This is crazy!' Amanda continued during her bedroom broadcast, and before she has even taken a breath, hundreds of hearts flutter on to her screen - more tokens of 'love' from the thousands of people watching. Last month, the art graduate was going about her anonymous life as an illustrator for entertainment site  E! Online but her Periscope broadcasts, which show her going about her daily business in LA, have catapulted her into the limelight. And so far she has had little competition from 'real' celebrities. Ellen DeGeneres is the highest ranking star but is trailing behind Amanda with a mere three million 'loves'. 'This is like a reality show, but it’s not scripted,' Amanda tells her thousands of viewers continuing her bedroom broadcast. 'Before this happened I always thought I'd love to share my life with more people because I’m always up to really spontaneous things.' Amanda mulls over the day during a live broadcast, whilst she chats to the viewers messaging her (which appear on left of screen). So far she has been 'loved' 7.5million times, shown by hearts on the right . The new app not only allows users to stream live video to anyone on Earth who wants to watch, but allows viewers  to chat to the broadcaster in real time by typing  messages that pop up on screen. So Amanda's monologue is peppered with shout-outs and answers to questions from her viewers. 'Hey Charles,' she says acknowledging a new follower. 'I was going to sleep when I thought about this last broadcast. Arlene you’re funny!' she continues in reference to a message, then 'You’re so beautiful' pops up from @Arlene. 'I don’t know how many of you saw me tonight,' she says. 'We randomly talked to my neighbour, then I went to see my friend Yonatan. Then I met with a Periscope follower for the first time.' A little yellow square with the message 'Show us your boobs' flashes up on screen. 'Why would you do that?' she adds. 'Now you're blocked forever.' A live webcam platform, may seem to have porn written all over but users won't be flashing anything X-rated during broadcasts - nudity is banned. Although bought by Twitter in January for close to $100million (£67million), Periscope  is a tech mash-up of selfies, social networking and reality TV,  only launched last month, . Twitching curtains to peek at the neighbours may still be a 'no' but watching Amanda randomly go about her day? That's 'way cool', to quote the star herself. And like all the best social networking platforms, the content need not be thrilling to grab considerable global attention. In the last 24 hours, Amanda has broadcast some mundane errands, some sitting in traffic in her Prius (phone in recording mode balanced on her dash board, of course) and a random chat with her neighbour . Periscope allows people to live-stream video from their phones to their Twitter followers with the click of a button. The Periscope team outlined a range of possibilities for the service, including how it can turn any smartphone user into a global reporter. In the last 24 hours, Amanda has broadcast herself going on mundane errands, sitting in traffic in her Prius (phone in recording mode balanced on her dash board, of course) and a random chat with her neighbour. Five hours before her bedtime round-up, Amanda was broadcasting live from an LA bar, watching her friend Yonatan perform the bass guitar. 'I'm drinking water. I don't like to drink alcohol,' Amanda tells viewers in answer to their questions, before introducing some followers she's come across at the bar. 'Hey we're double Persicoping,' she says capturing her new friends waving their phones in the air capturing her capturing them. But it's all too much - even for Amanda. 'We’re going to get off the phone soon so we can enjoy each others' real company,' she says. What will today hold for Amanda when she wakes up in a few hours time? Judging by today, perhaps a trip to the post office, a bit of sitting in traffic and a lot of mulling over the wonders of her new found mutual love for Periscope. Sound thrilling? Don't be shy to admit it. Millions agree. Amanda broadcasting live from an LA bar. 'I'm drinking water. I don't like to drink alcohol,' she tells viewers in answer to questions about what she's drinking . Despite the initial hype surrounding the launch of Periscope, Twitter's iPhone app, which is being touted as a revolutionary new way to share news, there are already a concerning number of users, particularly women, reporting that they have been sexually harassed, or trolled. Justin Esgar , App Developer of the app Goodnight, told FEMAIL that because Periscope 'allows users to share even more of their intimate lives with each other than ever before', there are 'apparent dangers' that users have to consider before accessing it. Special features: The app, which is owned by Twitter, allows users to follow certain people (L) and scroll through a 'Watch' feed of live videos (R) Emma Barker, sex and relationships editor at Cosmopolitan.com, noted that the app is already crawling with men who are using the anonymity afforded to them by the app's settings in order to sexually harass women - including one of her female friends. She explained that her friend recently tried out the app by sharing a conversation she was having with her female roommate. They were fully clothed, sitting on a couch and casually conversing, yet 'within the first 20 seconds the first comment popped up’, asking for the women to ‘show butt’. While neither of them were speaking in an even remotely sexual manor, the lewd comments continued to pour in and included phrases such as: 'Show boobs', 'Age?' and 'I would soooo swipe right on both [sic]!' Streaming revolution: Periscope, an iPhone app that allows users to broadcast live video and audio to the internet, launched last Thursday . One particularly creepy user asked: 'Do you get out of the shower to pee?' According to Periscope's community guidelines, the app prohibits 'pornographic or overtly sexual content' as well as 'explicitly graphic content or media that is intended to incite violent, illegal or dangerous activities'. And while a spokesperson for the app told Emma that Periscope has a team dedicated to content review, there doesn't appear to be anything specific being done to prevent sexual commentary and online harassment. The app's policies are, unsurprisingly, similar to Twitter, which is currently testing out a 'quality filter' that monitors and removes threats and offensive language out of users notifications feeds. It's not clear as to whether or not Periscope will be given a similar screening system."

"Children caught throwing rocks at police in the Northern Territory will be removed from their families if their parents don't 'get off the grog' and bring them home, the local government has warned. The Northern Territory’s Chief Minister Adam Giles and Minister for Children and Families John Elferink made the threat after a recent rise in youth crime in Alice Springs surrounding the Easter holidays. ‘I’m giving the parents of the children responsible for this spate of violence a very clear message. Get your kids off the streets. Get them back to communities and back into school,’ Mr Giles said. Mr Elferink threatened: ‘If parents don’t want to see their children in care then they need to get off the grog and head back to their home community.’ In a media statement titled ‘strong consequences for Alice Springs rock throwers’ the government stated ‘the current situation would not be tolerated’. ‘These children will be regarded as requiring protection and we will take immediate action. Parents should not doubt our resolve to do this,’ Mr Giles added. Northern territory’s Chief Minister Adam Giles said parents should not doubt his 'resolve' to take their children into the hands of child protection services . Parents will also be fined $298 if their child is found on the streets during school hours. The manager of Jesuit Social Services in Alice Springs, John Adams, told ABC radio the government's announcement was a 'knee-jerk' reaction. 'Removing kids is never the best response to such an issue,' he said. On Monday night, 42 people were taken into protective custody and 34 young people were driven home after a group of 50 young people threw ‘large rocks’ at police. Northern Territory Police Superintendent Travis Wurst said none of the group have been identified but ‘the main protagonist of the incident is described as a male aged in his late teens/early twenties, of Aboriginal appearance.’ On Tuesday night no rocks were thrown at police but 34 people were taken into protective custody and 77 youths were conveyed home, while three youths were arrested for trespassing. This window was smashed in Alice Springs during the spate of rock throwing in the Northern Territory . Mr Giles (left) and Minister for Children and Families John Elferink (right) made the threat after a recent rise in youth crime in Alice Springs surrounding the Easter holidays . On Monday night 42 people were taken into protective custody and 34 young people were driven home after a group of 50 young people threw ‘large rocks’ at police . On Wednesday night, the crime spree appeared to calm. A Northern Territory police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: ‘We only received couple of reports of rock throwing near Anzac Hill and no reports of damage.’ There were 29 youths driven home by police as officers stepped up their police presence to deter anti-social behaviour. Superintendent Wurst said: ‘The reduction of property damage and rock throwing is encouraging and police will continue to target anti-social behaviour to ensure a safe environment for the people of Alice Springs.’ A NT Police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: ‘No police officers have been harmed by the rock throwing.’ 'No police officers have been harmed by the rock throwing,' a NT police spokesperson said . They said incidences of rock throwing had calmed down and that it wasn't a ‘regular occurrence’. ‘It’s more since the Easter Holidays and the carnival has been here,’ the police spokesperson said. Minister  Elferink, who is in Alice Springs assessing the situation, said: ‘I have directed my department to take strong action and take children into care where the legal grounds are met. 'Normally the department would see this as a last resort and be willing to work with parents but these are not normal circumstances.’ ‘Gangs of youth throwing rocks at police officers is not normal and is illegal. It’s an extreme circumstance and will bring a zero tolerance approach for this kind of behaviour.’"
"Retired news legend Barbara Walters still has some clout - and a strong opinion about how ABC can turn things around at the ratings-challenged show she created, The View. Barbara's magic bullet: Monica Lewinsky. Walters says that the former White House intern would be a 'run away success' on The View, a network source tells Daily Mail Online. She would attract great guests - even if casting her as a regular co-host would make it unlikely that potential 2016 Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton or President Bill Clinton would ever appear on the show again. Scroll down for video . Ever since their infamous interview in 1999 following the Bill Clinton scandal Barbara Walters has always believed Monica got the short end of the stick in the court of public opinion and has tirelessly defended her on the show over the years . Lewinsky recently participated in a 22-minute long TED Talk that has made international headlines. During the speech, the 41-year-old former White House intern talked about 'The Price of Fame' and redefined her story as the first victim of cyber-bullying. 'Barbara believes that Monica, 41, could make The View competitive and compelling and while a lot of Washington's elite may scratch the show off its must-visit press list, the younger demographic of online users would tune in daily to see what she had to say,' added the source. Last year when discussing Lewinsky with David Letterman, he asked her about Monica joining The View. It looked as though the late night host was reading her mind and she stuttered, 'I think it would be great if she were on The View. I wouldn't expect it tomorrow.' 'Tomorrow is now,' says the insider. The multi-host show was created by Walters in 1997 with an original panel of women including Meredith Vieira, Star Jones, Joy Behar and Debbie Matenopoulos. It defied the odds previous shows faced in the 11am time slot. Exit Rosie: She had enough of The View and vice versa . Despite numerous cast changes – Lisa Ling, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Rosie O'Donnell, Sherri Shepherd, and Jenny McCarthy have had stints as co-hosts on the show – The View became a force to be reckoned with in daytime TV. But after the exit of Behar and Hasselbeck and the addition of McCarthy, The View took a ratings dive. ABC decided to overhaul the show following the end of that season, and replaced Shepherd and McCarthy with Republican analyst Nicolle Wallace and actress Rosie Perez. The network also brought back O'Donnell to join the show's long-running moderator, Whoopi Goldberg. In-fighting between Goldberg and O'Donnell and endless backstage turmoil caused ABC to move the show from its Entertainment division to its News division. Despite numerous set changes and multiple updates to the show opening, the new ensemble never seemed to attract viewers and ratings continued to fall. ABC then had a failed attempt at firing Perez while she was rehearing for her Broadway show Fish in the Dark in January. In February, after the return of Goldberg who had been sidelined with a back injury, ABC let O'Donnell go but allowed her to use her recent divorce as her excuse for departing the show for a second time. (She had a failed one-year stint as moderator in 2007 that abruptly ended after she walked off set following an on-air blow-up with co-host Hasselbeck.) Down to three co-hosts and two chairs vacant, ABC has been closely looking at Destiny's Child member Michelle Williams, fashion host Stacy London, former child star Raven Symone and comedienne Michelle Collins as potential replacements. President Bill Clinton appeared on The View in 2011 talking about his book Back to Work and the current economic troubles occurring in America. It is doubtful he would be a guest if Monica was co-host . The View celebratesd 4000 shows with guest co-hosts Barbara Walters and Joy Behar . The network is also seriously considering convincing former co-host Behar to return as a full-time panelist. She has made a half-dozen co-host appearances since January and was on-hand for the show's 4,000-episode celebration show. Walters, who sold all rights to The View back to ABC a year before her retirement in May 2014, has been contacting James Goldston, President of ABC News, and Ben Sherwood, President, Disney-ABC Television Group, trying to convince them to hire Lewinsky, insiders tell Daily Mail Online. Walters believes that Lewinsky could reignite interest in the show and after a decade-long silence; she has a lot to say. 'Barbara has been like a godmother to Monica ever since their infamous interview in 1999 following the Bill Clinton scandal. She's always believed Monica got the short end of the stick in the court of public opinion and has tirelessly defended her on the show over the years,' a source close to the show says. Barbara told Letterman, 'I like Monica. She never had a chance to move on,' the way Bill and Hillary did. 'She's an intelligent, nice woman.' Lewinsky recently participated in a 22-minute long TED Talk that has made international headlines. During the speech, the 41-year-old former White House intern spoke about 'The Price of Fame' and redefined her story as the first victim of cyber-bullying. Barbara Walters, arrives for the Oscar De La Renta fashion show last February. She remains spry and opinionated too. She's convinced Monica would help save the show . Not only that, but since re-emerging out of the shadows to address her affair with Clinton in a compelling Vanity Fair essay last May, she has taken on an extremely attractive new look to match her new persona. According to a representative of the show, Lewinsky has been asked to come on the show as a guest to discuss her anti-bullying campaign but is not on the list of potential co-hosts at this time. While current co-host Wallace would love to have Lewinsky as a regular on the show, staunch Democratic supporters and Clinton friends Goldberg and Perez aren't feeling the idea at all, the source revealed. A few weeks ago The Talk managed to edge out The View in the Nielsen ratings, but The View has come back to beat out the relative newcomer ever since. 'Whatever ABC News plans to do to salvage the show, they better do it fast,' the source concluded!"
"Winning your flutter in this week's Grand National all depends on a string of superstitions and rituals, a survey has revealed. And research shows that if your tip is seventh down the list or the jockey's racing colours are Royal blue, emerald green or red, then you're more likely to return to the bookies and collect a few bob. The world's greatest steeplechase takes place on Saturday at Aintree, which will be watched by a worldwide audience of 600 million with an estimated £500 million being staked globally by punters. Scroll down for video . Four out of ten Britons betting on the Grand National won last year by Pineau De Re, centre, make their choice purely down to the name of the horse while 70 per cent of women admit relying on pot luck . Jockey Sam Twiston Davies, pictured, admitted that he always salutes a magpie on his way to Aintree . Out of 2,000 Britons who confirmed they would be having a bet, 40 per cent of them admitted their selection would be purely down to the name of the horse because it would have struck a chord. A surprising 60 per cent said their secret superstition was to have the same family members gathered around the TV watching the race every year. Others revealed they sit in the same chair and have exactly the same food and drink during the race every time – and even wear the same 'lucky' clothes! When it comes to the big day, the survey – by National sponsors Crabbie's Alcoholic Ginger Beer – showed that a huge 70 per cent of women simply rely on pure chance opposed to 47-per cent of men who try to study form. But, to the bookies' glee, less than 20 per cent of those quizzed said their quirky superstitions actually produced a win. Survey boss Al Cross said: 'It seems most people have some sort of good luck charm. My own ritual is to always pick the well turned-out horse. It's worked for me twice, but I will keep trying.' And leading jump jockey Sam Twiston-Davies added: 'I only have one race ritual, and that is always to salute a magpie!' Saturday's Grand National will be the final time Tony McCoy, pictured on 2010 winner Don't Push It, will race ."
"It was a fishing trip with a very big catch – namely the £9 homemade rowing boat in which the two anglers ventured out on to the open sea. Built with discarded scraps from house conversions including loft insulation board and polystyrene, it was glued together with silicone sealant. Amazingly, the 6ft vessel held together long enough for the men to set up their rods and haul in some fish. But they were scuppered when an oar snapped 200 yards off Jaywick, Essex, and they had to call 999. The bungling fishermen who had to be rescued from their DIY boat, who have been named as Aaron Jones, right, and Jamie Toms, left . The DIY boat used by a pair of fisherman, who had to be rescued by a lifeboat crew. The men cobbled it together using insulation boards, scrap plywood, laminate flooring, coat hangers and silicone glue . The anglers had already taken the boat out to sea the day before their rescue without any problems. They got the materials to build the boat for free and spent £9 on silicone glue to hold the boat together . A lifeboat crew arrived to find neither man wearing a lifejacket, and one unable to swim. Despite the experience, one of the men yesterday pledged to return to the water with another homemade boat. Jamie Toms, 27, a self-employed builder, said: ‘I’m already thinking about doing it again but next time I’ll get a little engine instead of oars. ‘The boat itself was solid – it was waterproof. We took it out the day before and we were in it for two or three hours and it floated, no problem. The long and the short of it is that this time one of the oars snapped. They were proper oars but one snapped at the join so we were stranded with only one oar. ‘I only called 999 as I was worried for my mate as he can’t swim. He was panicking and shaking because it was cold, so I was more concerned for his safety than my own. ‘If it was just me out there I would have tried to swim to shore. What’s the worst that could happen? I would have drowned.’ The boat was put together by Mr Toms’s friend Aaron Jones, who scavenged 4in-thick insulation board, polystyrene and scrap wood. The DIY boat during its construction. The pair used scrap wood that they had found and spent just £9 buying silicone adhesive . As well as using scraps of wood, the pair also made a DIY anchor using a 15 metre rope and a lump of scrap iron . After rescuing the men, who were found without lifejackets the RNLI crew had to bring the boat to the shore . After the rescue, Clacton RNLI returned the fishing equipment to the pair before they destroyed the unseaworthy boat . One of the men, named as Jamie Toms, who had to be rescued . Coathanger wire was used to make the rowlocks, the rings on either side of the boat that provide the pivot for the oars. The only outlay was £9 on the sealant to glue and waterproof the craft. Mr Jones, who is also in his 20s, refused to comment yesterday. But Mr Toms added: ‘We’re just two lads who were bored and wanted to make a boat – why not? It’s better than going out and doing drugs and committing crime. 'Obviously I said thanks to the lifeguards and sorry for being a bit of an idiot and going out with no safety gear. ‘I was quite calm as I’d already been in that situation before so I knew what to do. ‘In about 2006 me and a few mates bought a rubber dinghy and got p***** up as we wanted to see how far we could get out before needing to be rescued.’ The pair, from Jaywick, lost their anchor, made from scrap iron, in the rescue. But they did come home with a dogfish, two cod and three crabs. Joff Strutt, of Clacton RNLI, said the lifeboat crew had been stunned by the men’s stupidity. The boat was destroyed."

"Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil seemed to be in a enjoying his home comforts after arriving back in London following the international break, posting a picture putting his feet up with his dog. The German star was in fine form as the World Cup winners beat Georgia 2-0 in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday, and is now setting his sights on the Premier League encounter with Liverpool at the weekend. And Ozil gave an insight into what he does in his downtime after taking a snap of him playing with his pet with the caption: 'Home Sweet Home'. Mesut Ozil posted a picture on Twitter relaxing with his dog on Wednesday after returning home to London . Ozil impressed on international duty as Germany beat Gerogia 2-0 in a Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday . The midfielder, who was signed for £42.5million from Real Madrid in 2013, missed Arsenal's last game against Newcastle through illness, but will be expected to start against Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium. Ozil was said to have been spotted in a Berlin nightclub after missing the Gunners' 2-1 win at St James' Park, though manager Arsene Wenger rubbished those claims. He has been doing the business on the pitch after returning from injury though,  wracking up four assists and scoring three goals since January. And the former Schalke man says he is finally adjusting to English football, claiming he fits in 'perfectly'. 'There are a lot of what we call 'English weeks' in Germany - where you play twice, and there's no winter break either,' he said. 'It's demanding because you don't have many breaks to recover, but as a footballer it's great to have so many games and I'm the sort of player who prefers playing in many matches - that's why I fit perfectly here.' The playmaker has been in fine form since returning from injury for Arsenal this year ."
"Dominic Grieve said the right to report proceedings in the Commons and Lords without fear of legal recourse did not ""necessarily extend"" to all media.
Remarks repeated ""out of context"" might not be covered, he suggested.
He also warned MPs against revealing details of court orders in Parliament.
When court proceedings were active, parliamentarians should only refer to them in Parliament in ""the most exceptional of circumstances"", he said in a speech in London.
MPs are protected from prosecution over statements made in Parliament under what is known as parliamentary privilege - one of the oldest rights enshrined in British law.
But there was controversy earlier this year when Lib Dem MP John Hemming use it to name footballer Ryan Giggs in Parliament as someone who had been granted an injunction preventing reporting of his private life.
Mr Hemming justified the move - criticised by many other MPs at the time - by arguing that the information was already widely known to the public and he was not abusing the privilege as he could have named the footballer outside the Commons without being accused of contempt of court.
Parliamentary privilege was also used by Lord Stoneham to disclose a privacy order obtained by former chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, Sir Fred Goodwin.
Referring to the issue of parliamentary privilege, Mr Grieve said that while - as an MP himself - he defended the right of Parliament to determine its own affairs it was ""important to remember these are the privileges of Parliament as a whole and not that of the individual member"".
""It ill serves the parliamentary process if court orders are openly flouted for no good reason,"" he added.
""It is not for a parliamentarian to ignore the careful and measured approach of a judge when deciding if an injunction should be granted.
""The House of Commons has resolved that the sub judice rule applies to proceedings which are active and they shall not be referred to in any motion, debate or question.
""Parliament and the Courts should each be left to do their work without interference by the other - save in the most exceptional of circumstances.""
Mr Grieve, the government's senior law officer, also suggested the media must ""beware"" reporting anything said in Parliament which flouted court orders.
The extent of legal protection available to them in such cases had yet to be ""authoritatively decided"", he said.
""It is still an open question as to whether something said in Parliament in breach of a court order may be repeated in the press,"" he added.
""The privilege to report parliamentary proceedings, which is provided by the parliamentary papers act and covers Hansard, does not necessarily extend to all publications which are not published by order of Parliament.
""It is likely that it does extend to a fair and accurate report of proceedings in Parliament. But just because something has been said does not mean it can be repeated out of context.""
A joint committee of Parliament is currently looking into whether there should be a change in the law relating to privacy injunctions, something many MPs think is necessary.
Next week it will take evidence from public figures such as Max Mosley, Steve Coogan and Hugh Grant."
"The top-paying companies in America have been revealing - and film-streaming service Netflix is near the top of the pile, paying a median of $180,000 a year. The other boldface name in the group is Google, which comes in at no. 13 and pays an median of $143,000 a year. But to make it on to the payrolls of these top companies, workers needs to be highly educated, highly skilled or highly connected - sometimes all three. They fall into three categories - tech companies, law firms and consulting firms. Netflix has come a long way from its days of mailing DVDs to subscribers across the country. Its 2,000 employees have a median salary of $180,000 now . Nine of the top 15 companies are in the tech sector, according to salary data compiled by the recruiting company Glassdoor.com. These firms are competing furiously to hire and retain the relatively small number of top-notch computer programmers who make Silicon Valley such a magnet for money. Consulting and law firms rely on relationships with clients and so once employees establish themselves, they become more and more valuable and command higher salaries. Wall Street law firm, Skadden, Arps, one of the largest and most prestigious law firms in the nation, comes in at the top of the list. The median compensation there there is $182,000. Skadden has 4,500 employees - more than 1,800 of whom are high-grossing attorneys. Netflix, which has 2,000 employees, comes in second. Management consultants take the three spots - Strategy&, McKinsey & Company and A.T. Kearney all pay $160,000 median salaries. Mozilla, the company that oversees the Firefox web browser and TureCar, which lists car sales, are both on the list. Other than Google, Netflix, Mozilla and TrueCar, most people have likely not heard of the companies of the highest-paid list. The companies are also mostly small and midsize. Nearly all of them employ fewer than 5,000 people. Some just a few hundred. Google, which has 53,000 employees, is by far the largest employer on the list."
"The protesters have built barricades and occupied key road junctions, and want to replace the government with an unelected ""People's Council"".
The government has deployed 18,000 security personnel to maintain order.
Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has offered to meet protest leaders to discuss potentially delaying the polls.
Protesters allege Ms Yingluck is a proxy for her brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted by the military in 2006 and is currently in self-imposed exile.
Thaksin-allied parties draw considerable support from rural voters and have won the last four elections.
By Jonathan HeadBBC News, Bangkok
It was all wearily familiar - the shrieking whistles, the colourful umbrellas, the rousing speeches and music from the stages, which had been moved overnight to block some of Bangkok's busiest intersections.
And there was a certain weariness visible among the protesters, now in their third month of street rallies. Not the same levels of energy I saw a month ago.
Nor do these loyal supporters of a movement largely defined by its hatred of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and her family really know what results to expect from their marathon protest. They know about the idea of an ""appointed committee"" to fix Thai politics, and they can all mouth the slogans ""Reform Before Election"", and ""Shutdown Bangkok, Restart Thailand"".
But, asked what would happen if the prime minister resigned, and her own substantial support base outside Bangkok were to refuse to accept this, no one had an answer. ""Well, it doesn't matter, because we are going to win anyway"", was one woman's hopeful answer.
The longer these debilitating protests continue, the more likely a dramatic, perhaps violent, showdown between the two irreconcilable sides of Thai politics.
Would that spark the much-rumoured military intervention? A coup still seems unlikely, and yet not impossible. The crowds on the street are just a part of a bigger game, involving bargaining and brinkmanship by leaders on all sides.
In a conversation with Anchalee Praireerat, one of the more hard-core protest leaders, she would not say exactly what she expected to happen. But she assured me it would all be over in three days, and that the protesters would win.
But the protesters claim the Thaksin-allied parties' populist policies have created a flawed democracy. The main opposition party is now boycotting the 2 February polls.
Anti-government demonstrators have called on Ms Yingluck - who has urged protesters to respect the democratic process and use the February elections to choose the next government - to step down.
Thailand's election commission has called for the vote to be postponed to May.
But this is unlikely to satisfy the protesters, who want the Shinawatra family to be purged from politics, and a two-year period without elections in which an appointed committee would reform Thailand's political system, the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok reports.
At least eight people have been killed since the protests began late last year. On Saturday, at least seven people were injured when unknown gunmen opened fire on demonstrators at the main rally site in Bangkok.
On Sunday night, an unidentified gunman attacked demonstrators at a protest site, shooting at least one man, officials said.
Police said a gunman also fired shots at the opposition party headquarters in a separate incident, although no casualties were reported.
Thousands are reported to have turned out for Monday's demonstrations. Protesters say they intend to achieve what they are calling a shutdown of the capital.
Protester Darunee Suredechakul told AP news agency: ""The government has to go. Reforms must be carried out.""
""We don't want to see the same old corrupted politicians returning to power over and over again,"" she added.
Seven major intersections have been blocked by the anti-government protest movement, which has erected stages and piles of sandbags across the roads, the BBC's Jonathan Head reports.
The government says it wants life to continue as normal through the shutdown and has ordered extra trains to run on the mass transit system and provided thousands of additional parking places outside the city centre, our correspondent adds.
Protesters also plan to surround key ministries and cut off their power supply in a bid to prevent them from functioning. About 150 schools have been told to close.
The protesters say they will remain in place for several days - but say they will not target public transport or the airports, which were closed for several days by anti-Thaksin protesters in 2008.
Protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban, who was formerly a senior opposition party politician, described the movement as ""a people's revolution"".
Ms Yingluck was ""no longer prime minister"" in the eyes of the demonstrators, he told reporters on Monday.
The government says it is deploying 8,000 soldiers and 10,000 police to keep order.
The military - which has carried out several coups in the past - has refused to rule out another one. Some fear an escalation of violence could lead to a military intervention.
The government has so far worked to avoid confrontation with the protesters.
Ms Yingluck had ""ordered all police and military personnel to exercise utmost restraint and not to use all kinds of weapons in handling the protesters"", the deputy prime minister said.
The political unrest is the worst to hit Thailand since the protests of 2010, which were against a government led by the current opposition party and left more than 90 people, mostly civilian protesters, dead.
The current protests began in November after Thailand's lower house passed a controversial amnesty bill which critics said could allow Mr Thaksin to return without serving time in jail for a corruption conviction. The bill was later rejected by the Senate.
Thailand remains bitterly divided over Mr Thaksin, one of the most polarising characters in Thai politics.
He is deeply unpopular with urban and middle class voters, but commands strong support in the rural communities his policies helped, with thousands of villages in north-east Thailand calling themselves ""red villages"" to indicate their loyalty to his party."
"These are toxic times on Tyneside but the thousands of supporters who boycotted were at least spared another dispiriting display which equalled a club-record rot of six straight defeats in the Premier League.

In fact, head coach John Carver fears his side – the worst in the division on present form – could yet plummet towards the bottom three. ‘We are in amongst a relegation battle.

It’s another defeat and that’s not good enough. This is the most difficult situation I’ve ever been in but I’m not going to give up on it.’ Although the official attendance was returned as a massively inaccurate 47, 427 – making it the biggest of the weekend in the top-flight – estimates had it nearer 40,000 as fans stayed away in protest at Mike Ashley’s running of the club, which this month returned record profits of £18.7million before revealing they have a further £34m in the bank. The billionaire will need to part with a sizeable chunk of that cash this summer if Newcastle are to avoid a season-long struggle against relegation next time around. One banner – unfurled during a pre-match protest outside of the Gallowgate End – captured the mood of frustration and mistrust among supporters – ‘NUFC – Balance sheet champions, 2008-2014’. Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher, meanwhile, launched a scathing attack on Ashley. ‘People will say as supporters you’ve got to come back, you’ve got to get behind your team. But what are the owners doing for supporters?’ he said. ‘Since Mike Ashley’s been here they’ve been relegated once and they could be relegated again. ‘So he’s balanced the books and he’s made money because he’s a businessman, but I think of these people and wonder, “Don’t you want to be excited yourself?”. ‘I’m getting bored by Newcastle. Why does Mike Ashley want the club if there’s nothing happening? There’s no cup run, I just don’t get it. I don’t get why he wants to own a football club.’ The defeat leaves Newcastle seven points above the drop zone and Carver has previously confessed that he does not know where their next point is coming from. Tottenham striker Harry Kane at full stretch with of Spurs is chased down by Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini . After Kane was chosen as caretaker of the captain's armband, Jan Vertonghen returned to lead Tottenham at St James' Park . Kane is assessed early in the match after inadvertently being caught in the head by the arm of Newcastle's Vernon Anita . On this evidence, they may well have to rely on their current tally of 35 being enough. They were hardly helped here by Tim Krul. But perhaps the loss of form of the usually-dependable goalkeeper best represents the problems which have plagued the squad in recent weeks. The Dutch stopper could have done more to keep out Chadli’s first-half opener and was again culpable as Eriksen struck to restore the lead after Jack Colback had levelled early in the second half. Chadli appeared to have exhausted his options as he floated in possession 25 yards from goal only to drop his shoulder before slamming into the bottom corner with Krul sluggish in his pursuit of the strike. Carver reacted to an insipid first half by hooking the ineffective Yoan Gouffran and midfielder Mehdi Abeid and within 20 seconds they were level when Colback steamed onto a loose ball inside the area before slotting home. Chadli was given space outside the box and pulled the trigger just as Newcastle midfielder Jack Colback arrived in defence . Colback is too late as the Belgian laces his shot from range and it nestles in the bottom corner giving Newcastle keeper Tim Krul no chance .

Chadli leaps in the air with delight after his sublime strike for the opening goal of the match . Christian Eriksen (left) tussles with Newcastle's Ryan Taylor at St James' Park on Sunday . But parity was to last just eight minutes and Eriksen’s free-kick – intended as a cross – bounced through the weak grasp of Krul and into the back of the net. Krul, in fairness, made a string of fine stops to keep Newcastle within one but he was powerless to prevent Kane rolling beyond him in stoppage-time after he had skipped onto Erik Lamela’s through-ball. In doing so Kane became the first Spurs player since Gary Lineker in 1992 to score 30 goals in one season. And the England striker now has Lineker’s total of 35 in his sights. Jack Colback is in the right place at the right time to pounce on a loose ball in the midfield and equalise for Newcastle . Colback jumps for joy after his fourth goal of the season, all of which have been scored at Newcastle's home St James' Park . Fans applaud while one holds up a 'Love NUFC, No Ashley' sign, while Colback's Newcastle team-mates join in the celebrations . ‘I'm very proud but there are five games left and, hopefully, I'll get a few more goals,’ he said. Manager Mauricio Pochettino added: ‘We were better than Newcastle and deserved the win. ‘For Harry, it is a fantastic achievement. We need to push him now because he has a lot of improvement left in him.’ Newcastle, meanwhile, will also need to improve in the final five matches of their sorry season, or risk starting next in the second tier.

"Trevor O'Neill was shot outside a supermarket in Majorca just after 21:00 local time on Wednesday, Irish national broadcaster RTÃ‰ reports.
His shooting is understood to be linked to a feud between Irish criminal gangs.
Mr O'Neill's partner and three children, aged five, seven and 10, were with him when the attack happened.
They had travelled to Majorca on Saturday for a holiday for his 40th birthday.
Police believe the attack was connected to a dispute between the Hutch and Kinahan groups, but Mr O'Neill was not the intended victim.
The feud between the gangs was sparked by the killing of Dubliner Gary Hutch in Spain last year and most of the resulting violence and murders have happened in Dublin.
Attempts to revive Mr O'Neill at the scene failed and police are said to be searching for up to three suspects.
It is understood that he was not linked to organised crime but may have been talking to a member of the Hutch family at the time."

Det Insp Dave Bolton said: ""Inquiries so far lead us to believe there is a likelihood that the tragic events that led to the deaths do not involve a third party.""
A post-mortem examination is scheduled to take place on Friday.

"The Public Health Wales study looks at adverse experiences in childhood (ACEs) which include parents separating.
Children with four or more ACEs, around 14%, are three times more likely to get lung or heart disease later in life.
One senior health figure said instead of ""mending broken adults"" a focus was needed on ""building stronger children"".
The findings are being published to coincide with a major international public health conference, hosted by PHW in Cardiff.
It is the last of three PHW studies looking at the first 1,000 days of life. More than 2,000 adults in Wales were interviewed.
The importance of giving children the best start in life has long been appreciated.
But this research looks at the long term impact of bad experiences in those crucial early years and how it could mean more chronic illness and more pressure on frontline services further down the line.
Those having had four or more ACEs are also:
Prof Mark Bellis, director of policy and research at Public Health Wales said: ""Most of us have the odd shock in childhood and after that we relax and we're comforted by parents and our bodies develop at that lower, more relaxed level.
""But if you get constant exposure to adverse childhood experiences, your body develops at a higher state of tension, it's always looking out for more threats.
""That means as your body develops, it's used to being ready to be injured or hurt in some way and it wears out quicker.
""You're also more ill at ease, you may develop poorer metal health, you're more likely to use alcohol and drugs - and they increase your risks of ill health later on in life. All that adds up to you developing poor health, earlier.""
But a child can experience adverse incidents even from within the womb.
NSPCC midwife Nikki Rhys-Jones said: ""In the second trimester [the period from 13 to 27 weeks] of a woman's pregnancy, the baby can hear - so the baby will be aware of the sounds around her.
""So the baby can start relating and connecting to parents, however things like domestic abuse, violence in the household, shouting - a baby will experience that and those things will cause stress to a baby and impact on its development.""
Emerging research suggests the effects could also be passed on from one generation to the next.
Genomic expert Dr Tom Connor, consultant for Public Health Wales and senior lecturer at Cardiff University, said: ""As individuals, we're almost a symphony of genes, firing off at different times.
""Epigenetics [which looks at changes in genes] actually controls expression of genes - and so things like smoking and drinking can actually affect the expression of genes, which can be passed on to our children.
""There's growing evidence that the lifestyle choices we make ourselves have an effect on our children. That's an immediate effect when they're born and potentially if we do things, for example smoking which can do damage to our children's DNA, that can be a long term effect for their entire lifetime.""
But this is not just a challenge for the NHS.
Children who have had four or more adverse incidents are also 15 times more likely to be a perpetrator of violence, and 14 times more likely to be a victim.
If everyone shrinks into their core responsibilities, the cracks get bigger and more and more people fall down the cracks
Alun Michael, South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner said the force was being made more aware of the impact of domestic incidents on children in the background - and it can only improve with all agencies working better together.
""There's tended to be an attempt to deal with those things by making referrals - pieces of paper passing from one organisation to another. You're never quite sure where they go,"" he said.
But a coordinated approach is not always easy to achieve, he argues, at a time when public spending is being squeezed.
""If everyone shrinks into their core responsibilities, the cracks get bigger and more and more people fall down the cracks and the consequences are more complex and dangerous further down the line,"" said Mr Michael.
""There's been a general feeling within Wales we must shrink together and not shrink apart. It's more important that we don't allow those gaps, that we don't let people fall down the cracks; we work together for a joined up approach.""
The Welsh Government said the evidence on the negative impact of ACEs was ""overwhelming"" and it was  ""working relentlessly"" to prevent and reduce the long term impact on children who have experienced them.
A spokesperson pointed to the Flying Start, Families First, and Supporting People programmes, as well as investing directly in children's health and well-being programmes.
For Prof Bellis it is crucial for the future to get it right.
""The long term costs of leaving these things untreated are enormous,"" he said. ""What we've got to focus on is instead of mending broken adults we must build stronger children."""

With her was actress Salma Hayek, 48, who was there to receive an award and looked cheerful in a bright red off-the-shoulder ensemble. After presenting Mexican Ms Hayek with her prize, Letizia, who is recently returned from Copenhagen, posed for photos alongside some of the other winners. Among them were conductor Inma Shara and doctor Maria Neira, while watching from the audience was communication company Grupo Zeta's president Antonio Mosbah. For all the star power on show though, all eyes were on Letizia who looked relaxed and happy as she chatted to Ms Hayek. The 48-year-old star, who brought her seven-year-old daughter Valentina to the ceremony, was taking a break from her preparations for next month's Cannes Film Festival. Ms Hayek stars in Tale of Tales, a dark Matteo Garrone fantasy based on a collection of 17th century Italian folk stories, which is set to make its début at the event on 14th May.

"Lorraine Bracco has revealed that The Sopranos creator David Chase wanted her to play the role of Tony's wife Carmela and not Dr. Jennifer Melfi, his psychiatrist. The Oscar nominated actress, 60, revealed she turned down the starring role alongside James Gandolfini in the landmark HBO drama because she had already played a mobster's wife in Goodfellas, nine years previously. Accusing Chase of lazy casting, Bracco chose instead the complicated role of Dr. Melfi, who provided the therapy that allowed New Jersey mob boss Tony Soprano to justify many of his monstrous acts. Scroll down for video . Revelation: Lorraine Bracco said that she was first approached to play the role of Carmela in The Sopranos and not Dr. Jennifer Melfi . Speaking to Huffington Post Live, Bracco explained how she convinced Chase to change his mind. 'I fell in love with David (Chase) the minute I met him, when I walked into the room. 'I said, 'I like this guy. And I said, 'Look, I don't think I should play Carmela because I did it, I did it in a Scorsese movie, I got an Oscar nomination. 'I really don't think I'm going to bring so much to this for you that I haven't done already,' she told HuffPost Live on Monday. What could have been: Lorraine Bracco wanted to play Dr. Jennifer Melfi (left) but was originally asked by show creator David Chase to play Carmela Soprano. He cast Edie Falco (right) instead . Oscar nominated: Lorraine Bracco starred opposite Ray Liotta in Goodfellas in 1990. The Martin Scorsese mob drama is recognized as one of the greatest movies in that genre . Obviously not wanting to count herself out of what became arguably the best television drama ever made, Bracco asked to play the character of Dr. Melfi instead. 'I said, 'But I really love this script, and I want to play Mefli.' ... And he agreed with me that I'd done it already and it wasn't really incredible creative casting for him. He said, 'You want to play Melfi?' And I said, 'Yeah, I want to play Mefli'' So I left on that, and he gave it to me.' Speaking about the untimely death of James Gandolfini in 2013, Bracco said his passing was devastating and a wake up call. 'Well yea. My parents died nine days apart and then later Jimmy passed and Jimmy is a decade younger than me,' said Bracco to HuffPost Live. Soprano's stars: Edie Falco, James Gandolfini and Lorraine Bracco at the launch of the show's fifth season in New York City in 2005 . 'I always teased him, 'You gotta get rid of that belly' and he would say, 'Oh, it's pure muscle!' said Bracco. 'But yea, it (his death) was devastating. Young man, talented, at the peak of his career. The peak of his life with a beautiful wife and and baby and his son Michael. 'Greatest guy ever. Loving, caring, sweet, funny, jokester'"
"A white supremacist with a split tongue and 'Satan' tattooed on his face has been sentenced to life in prison for stabbing a black man to death. David Adam Pate from Lancaster, North Carolina, told his mother he enjoyed knifing 33-year-old Ricky James 39 times after luring him into some woods with wine in November 2013. The 25-year-old serial criminal, who pleaded guilty to the murder on Thursday, told police he just wanted to 'cut his dad gum head off,' and that he cut him with a butcher's knife, 'just like the one Michael Myers used in (the movie) Halloween.' During an interview after his arrest, he even blamed the victim for the murder, saying: 'It was his fault. Why would anyone go drinking and go into the woods with someone who looks like me? ' Scroll down for video . Jailed: David Adam Pate, 25, (mugshot from 2013 left and in court on Thursday right) from Lancaster, North Carolina told his mother he enjoyed knifing 33-year-old Ricky James 39 times after luring him into some woods with wine in November 2013. He was sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole for the slaying . During the sentencing hearing, James's two brothers described him as the 'devil', admitting that they wanted him to suffer in prison. One of them, who spoke at his sentencing, said a man like that 'doesn't deserve to live on this earth' before storming out of the court screaming in distress. According to The Charlotte Observer, police found at least 20 knives, both store bought and homemade, and more than 20 masks in Pate's home after he was arrested, when children who were playing in the woodland found the victim's decomposing body. He was already in jail at the time, having been arrested for disorderly conduct two weeks before. As he was booked into custody, officers took a frightening mugshot of Pate. He stuck out his split tongue and revealed a 974 tattoo on his neck - the sign of the white power gang, Gangster Disciples. Emotionless: Prosecutors said Pate deserved to die in prison. He has never offered the James family an apology for the 'senseless and remorseless' act . Confession: The 25-year-old told police during a taped interview used a butcher's knife, 'just like the one Michael Myers used in (the movie) Halloween' to kill James (right) During a police interview, he described how he covered James's remains up because he wanted to kill someone in the same place. He said he tied James with a rope from neck to ankles so that he could drag the body away after the stabbing site, but was too drunk and tired to continue to try and drag James's body to a nearby creek. Prosecutors added they they thought Pate deserved to die behind bars. Solicitor Randy Newman told the court: 'This is an evil man standing before you. If anyone deserves life in prison, it's David Pate.' Judge Dan Hall sentenced Pate to life in prison with no chance for parole, calling the murder a 'senseless and remorseless' act. Pate has never spoken to the family or offered an apology. Horrifying: After he was arrested Pate even blamed the victim for the murder, saying: 'It was his fault. Why would anyone go drinking and go into the woods with someone who looks like me.'"
"A police officer has been charged with leaking confidential information about the arrest of fallen AFL star Ben Cousins to his reporter girlfriend. Channel 7 Perth news reporter Monique Dirksz got the scoop on Cousins' arrest when she was the only journalist outside Freemantle Police station at 2am on March 12 when he was released on bail. The troubled star was arrested on March 11 over an alleged low-speed chase from Bicton to Mosman Park, in Perth. First Class Constable Daniel Jamieson is said to have been dating Ms Dirksz at the time and is accused of divulging information that gave her a particular advantage, WA Today reports. Scroll down for video . Officer Daniel Jamieson (left) is accused of leaking confidential information about Ben Cousins' arrest in March to his girlfriend Channel 7 Perth news reporter Monique Dirksz . Police investigators became suspicious when Ms Dirksz (right) and her cameraman were the only people outside Freemantle Police station at 2am on March 12 when Cousins (left) was granted bail . Acting Police Commissioner Steve Brown said the policeman allegedly looked up the information on a police computer. The 29-year-old was stood down immediately and has been charged with four counts of disclosing official secrets between March 11 and 17, 2015. At 11:00am on March 12, Ms Dirksz tweeted: ‘Ben Cousins arrested after police pursuit. Charged with Reckless Driving, Fail to Stop and Failure to Provide a Sample of Breath.’ Mr Brown said Ms Dirksz had done nothing wrong but told 6PR Mornings radio Mr Jamieson’s alleged offences were an ‘absolute breach of trust not only for this agency but for the community at large’. Mr Jamieson will appear in Perth Magistrates Court on May 5. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ms Dirksz for comment. Monique Dirksz got the scoop on Cousins' arrest. Officer Jamieson accused of divulging information that gave her a particular advantage . At 11:00am on March 12, Ms Dirksz tweeted: ‘Ben Cousins arrested after police pursuit. Charged with Reckless Driving, Fail to Stop and Failure to Provide a Sample of Breath.’ Acting Police Commissioner Steve Brown confirmed Ms Dirksz had done nothing wrong . Mr Brown is also concerned about the 112 police officers who had accessed Cousins’ confidential files 300 times in two days, some of whom were working in regional WA. ‘We want to know why they have accessed these records. It's a breach of trust,’ Mr Brown said. Officers also reportedly accessed files containing information about Daniel Kerr, a fellow former West Coast Eagles player, according to The West Australian. The pair both made headlines in recent months, for different incidents. Mr Brown confirmed to Daily Mail Australia an internal investigation is underway relating to access, but would not confirm or make comment about the people whose records had been accessed. Police in Western Australia have come under fire after reports emerged that hundreds of officers unlawfully accessed information relating to the arrests of fallen AFL star Ben Cousins (pictured on April 9) 'I can confirm that WA Police are currently investigating accesses, by a large number of police employees, to the records of high profile persons within our internal computer systems,' Commissioner Brown said in a statement. 'The focus of the investigation will be to determine if the accesses were justified having regard to the work role of each officer. This process will take some weeks, if not months, to complete. Allegations will be investigated under Section 440A of the Criminal Code, which states police officers face up to 12 months in prison or a $12,000 fine for unauthorised computer usage. 'The disappointing thing from my view is that the behaviour of these personnel has triggered a series of resource intensive internal investigations which will likely have criminal and/or internal disciplinary outcomes,' Mr Brown said. The disgraced football player (pictured during his career) was arrested three times in two weeks in March, and another warrant was issued for his arrest in April when he failed to front court . Cousins, pictured here in handcuffs arriving at court earlier in April, has a well-documented and public battle with methamphetamine . 'I suspect that the investigation will find that the majority of the accesses will have stemmed from mere curiosity, however this will not be known for sure until we undertake the investigation,' he added. In light of the incident the Acting Commissioner also assured West Australians that their information was safe. 'The community can rest assured that we hold their information in high regard and will conduct investigations into all suspected access breaches of our computer systems.' However the WA Police Union has reacted negatively to the news of an investigation, with president George Tilbury telling The West Australian officers had done nothing wrong. He said they exhibited 'professional curiosity' and added 'there is no suggestion in these cases of any corruption'. Ben Cousins was arrested three times in two weeks at the end of March, following a slew of erratic events . Cousins was spotted climbing onto the roof of a two-storey home in Perth earlier this month . Footage also emerged showing Cousins running through the streets away from police . Cousins was arrested three times in two weeks at the end of March, following a slew of erratic events. Cousins was reportedly arrested compulsively taking photos of a Sikh temple before climbing onto the roof of another home in Canning Vale in Perth's south. The 36-year-old footballer allegedly upset Sikh priest, Jasvinder Singh and his wife when he reversed his car over the garden of the temple ground and parked in Mr Singh's personal car park. On March 16 Cousins, who has a history of serious drug abuse, was assessed at a mental health facility after he was caught behind the secure fences of an SAS base. On April 8, when Cousins failed to front court on the driving charges a warrant for his arrest was issued. The next day the Perth-based former AFL star surrendered himself at Fremantle Police Station. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."
"Researchers found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home.
Half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home.
The survey, of about 1,000 parents, found the most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn and peas.
Aubergine, chickpeas and spinach were among the least popular.
Of the parents questioned, 628 had children who ate school lunches.
(% denotes proportion of parents who said their child would eat each vegetable)
England's School Food Trust commissioned the research after a survey by the Mumsnet website suggested some parents gave their children packed lunches because they thought they were too fussy to eat anything else.
Trust chairman, Rob Rees, said: ""Every parent knows it's a nightmare watching their child push food around the plate.
""School meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and to increase the variety of foods in their diet.""
Mumsnet co-founder, Carrie Longton, said: ""Getting children to eat healthily is every parent's dream, but meal times at home can often be a battle ground and emotionally charged.
""From Mumsnetters' experience it seems that once at school there's a desire to fit in with everyone else and even some positive peer pressure to boast about the variety of what foods you can eat.
""School meals have also moved on quite a bit from when Mumsnetters were at school, with healthier options and more variety.""
School meals in England now have to comply with strict nutritional guidelines.
About four in 10 primary school children in England now eat school lunches, slightly more than in secondary schools.
More children in Scotland eat school lunches - about 46%.
The survey was conducted online between 26 February and 5th March among a panel of parents who had at least one child in school aged 4-17 years old."
"What would you get if one of the Queen's corgis ran off with one of Sir Ranulph Fiennes's Siberian huskies and had a puppy? A corgski, of course, just like Max. At just 18.5in from foot to shoulder, this diminutive fellow looks as if he was the runt of his litter. He is, in fact, a fully grown husky-corgi cross. But, unbelievably, Max has been abandoned and he's looking for a home. He's become a favourite with workers at the Dogs Trust in Basildon, Essex, who have been looking after him since he was found. Max (pictured) is a 18.5in high fully-grown husky corgi cross. After being abandoned, he has now taken refuge at the Dogs Trust in Basildon, Essex . Huskies, such as the one pictured, have become increasingly popular due to shows such as Game of Thrones . Pictured is a typical Welsh corgi. Max is part corgi, part husky, and is looking for a new home . 'It quickly became apparent that he was the epitome of the saying good things come in small packages,' says the Trust's Sam Davis. 'He caught the eye of our staff when he arrived, but as he was found as a stray, little is known about his life before.' Max is described as gentle, intelligent and big-hearted. There are currently 54 other wolf-like breeds being cared for by the charity's network of animal rehousing centres. The Trust is in no doubt that the trend is partly due to fans wanting to follow the stars of Game Of Thrones and Twilight, which have popularised wolf-like dogs such as Alaskan Malamutes and Siberian huskies. But many new owners are often unprepared to cope with the specific exercise and socialisation requirements of these breeds – and make a lifetime commitment to them – resulting in a significant number eventually being abandoned."
"A woman on trial for murder admitted in a recorded interview with police that she had shot two men and fed their bodies to her pigs, the jury heard on Tuesday. Susan Monica, a 66-year-old pig farmer and welder from southern Oregon, went on trial on Tuesday in Medford. She has been charged with killing two handymen living on her 20-acre pig ranch in a small Jackson County community and dismembering the bodies. Accused serial killer Susan Monica interrupts court in Medford, Oregon on Tuesday on the opening day of her trial for allegedly murdering two men, dismembering their bodies and feeding them to her pigs . Susan Monica, pictured left in court in January 2014, and right in an undated mugshot, has been accused of killing Robert Haney and Stephen Delicino a year apart at her pig farm and dismembering their bodies . Both victims were shot in the head and dismembered in what prosecutors allege were separate murders committed more than a year apart. Monica appeared in court dressed in skirt, blouse and short wig. In opening statements, defense lawyer Garren Pedemonte said Monica shot the first victim in self-defense, and the second as a kind of mercy killing. Stephen Frank Delicino, 59, was shot by Monica in self-defense in summer 2012. The defendant has claimed that she shot the second man, 56-year-old Robert Harry Haney, to put him out of his misery because she found her pigs already feeding on him, The Mail Tribune reported. The second killing took place in September 2013. Police searched her pig ranch last year after Monica was discovered using a food stamps card belonging to Haney, and found remains of the two men. Remains of two handymen who had been living on Monica's 20-acre pig ranch (pictured) in Jackson County, Oregon were found in 2014 after she was caught using one victim's food stamps card ."

"A giant lamb born weighing the same as a toddler is thought to be the biggest ever birthed in the UK. The animal, aptly named Hagrid after the fictional giant in Harry Potter, was born on Tuesday at three times the size of its peers. Dwarfing other newborns on the farm in Gelston near Grantham in Lincolnshire where he was born, Hagrid's owners believe he may be the biggest ever lamb born in the UK at 25lbs. Scroll down for video . Hagrid the lamb (right) is thought to be the biggest ever born in the UK, measuring 14inches tall and weighing 25lbs . The animal towers over his peers at the farm in Gelston near Grantham in Lincolnshire where he was born . The creature was born naturally on Tuesday and his mother is in remarkably good condition following the birth . Standing proudly at 14inches tall, the Suffolk Cross towers over his peers some five inches below. Despite his remarkable size the lamb was born naturally and his mother is making a good recovery. 'I couldn't believe my eyes - he was enormous. 'It presented all correctly with two feet and his head and I just needed to help him out. For such a massive lamb, a natural birth like that is pretty remarkable.' Despite Hagrid's shocking size, his mother has recovered from the birth and both are healthy. 'He is doing well. He is up on his feet and suckling and doing good, as is his mum. Thankfully she didn't suffer,' added Mr Elkington. Hagrid's owners said his mother had always birthed large lambs but that they had never seen one of his size . Chris Elkington and his wife Louise, who have 130 breeding Ewes on their farm, believe Hagrid is the largest lamb ever born in the UK . While normal lambs are born at around 10inches tall, Hagrid stands almost five inches taller and weighs significantly more . 'She had been a rather big ewe all year and when I got her in the shed I said to my wife we were going to have a massive lamb - but not quite that big. 'It was like lifting a small child out of her. We are very pleased. 'I have been farming for a long time - about 15 years - and never seen anything like this at all. It's incredible.' The previous record for the largest lamb in the UK was held by one called Joan born at 24lbs. In March this year another, called The Big One, was born at 2oz heavier in Wales. Delivered five days early on a farm in Denbigh, the animal was three times heavier than the average newborn lamb."
"Standing at 174 centimetres at just 12 years old, Venessa Harris looked destined to be a model. But just months after winning a modelling contest that would take her overseas, the 12-year-old's lofty plans to make it to the runway hit a snag. Venessa was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer on January 5 after a nasty fall, which left her with pains in her leg. Aspiring model Venessa Harris, 12, was diagnosed with bone cancer just months after she won a talent search . Venessa is pictured with her proud mother, Karen Monaghan, and grandmother, Lyn Harris . At first doctors dismissed it as growing pains but shortly after discovered she had Ewing’s sarcoma as her discomfort continued. Venessa's parents Kelly Harris and Karen Monaghan found out that their daughter could have cancer on Christmas Eve, but her condition wasn't confirmed until the new year. Mr Harris and Ms Monaghan spent Christmas at the family's Windorah home, in central west Queensland, with a dark cloud hanging over their head. 'It was really hard, extremely hard. We'd gone home Christmas Eve,' Ms Monaghan told Daily Mail Australia. The 12-year-old was the international winner in the Tamblyn Young Model Discovery contest . Venessa, whose family live in Windorah, gained self-confidence from the competition after struggling with low self-esteem . Her family have been a constant support for Venessa who is currently undergoing chemotherapy in Brisbane . 'It was a very scary at that time. We were given clear instructions for her not to use her leg.' Then days later at Lady Cilento Children's Hospital in South Brisbane, a doctor told the family what they had feared after Venessa underwent medical scans. The cancer was located in the neck of Venessa's right femur and she was told it had eaten away so much of her bone that it had the thickness of an egg shell. 'The first few weeks were really chaotic and extremely stressful, as Kelly and I went through that uncontrollable fear stage,' Ms Monaghan said. The family's mood was in stark contrast to what it had been just months earlier, when Venessa was named international winner in the Tamblyn Young Model Discovery contest in September. Ms Monaghan said the contest had lifted Venessa's spirits and boosted her self esteem. 'She was feeling pretty down with her self-esteem. You don't get to do many girly things out west,' the 45-year-old said. She hopes to pursue a career in modelling after she recovers. Tamblyn Models have started a fundraising campaign for their rising star . Venessa had suffered a fall and her leg started to hurt. It was after this she discovered she had cancer . 'We had entered her in the quest when her self-esteem was taking a hard battering at the time. 'It was an emotional night and a great thing for Venessa to participate in and to bring that self-esteem in her up again.' The win meant Venessa was signed by Tamblyn Models who would help her learn how to succeed in her chosen career. 'They teach Venessa things like how to walk, dress and prepare her for an overseas trip when she's 15 or so, when she is old enough to participate in some modelling jobs.' Ms Monaghan told Daily Mail Australia. Now that Venessa has been handed this opportunity she is prepared to hit the ground running when she has recovered. The 12-year-old is destined to be a model with the height of 174 centimetres and is determined to fulfill her dreams . Her family is able to be close by to Venessa as she receives her cancer treatment thanks to Childhood Cancer Support . Fortunately, Venessa is expected to make a full recovery after her chemotherapy treatment as doctors caught the cancer early . 'She's our selfie queen. She's always loved the camera,' Ms Monaghan said. 'It's all happened really differently to what we expected of Venessa and [modelling is] what she wants to do, she's made her mind up.' But it is not just Venessa's career Tamblyn Models has been helping with. Ms Monaghan said she did not know what she would have done without the help of founder Pam Tamblyn who assisted in finding them a place to stay with Childhood Cancer Support. The organisation - who are supported by the modelling agency - helps provide accommodation to rural families who want to live in the city to be closer their loved ones receiving much-needed medical treatment for conditions, such as cancer. Tamblyn Models have also started a fundraising campaign to help Venessa and her family through her cancer treatment. Fortunately, Venessa is expected to make a full recovery after her chemotherapy treatment as doctors caught the cancer early. This is the same good news more and more young Australians are receiving. Over recent decades, the rate of childhood cancer survival has risen by six per cent, according to new Cancer Council figures. Latest data shows a reduction in mortality rates overall, and an increase in five-year relative survival for all childhood cancers from 76 per cent in 1992-2001 to 82 per cent during 2002-2011. Sadly, one in five children still will die from cancer within five years, with about 95 children under the age of 15 dying from cancer each year in Australia."
"Chamali Fernando, candidate for Cambridge, was speaking at a hustings event last night when she made the comment . A Tory parliamentary candidate has sparked outrage after claiming mental health patients should wear coloured wristbands to flag up their conditions. Chamali Fernando, candidate for Cambridge, was speaking at a hustings event last night when she made the startling suggestion. She said wearing wristbands indicating a person's condition would help doctors, lawyers and police officers – because people suffering mental illnesses often struggled to explain themselves. Ms Fernando, a barrister for 12 years, said: 'Police, social services or hospitals dealing with people with conditions that affect their ability to communicate can decide they are being obstructive or evasive. 'They do not realise the person may have a mental health or other condition. The way they behave often affects the way they are treated. 'Carrying some kind of identification shows they have a particular condition so allowances can be made. 'There are also different ways of doing this without stigmatising the person, such as carrying a card with details of the condition but in some cases by wearing a coloured wristband.' Ms Fernando's 'shocking' suggestion was slammed by the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today. Mr Clegg told MailOnline: 'The Liberal Democrats have spent many years campaigning for an end to the stigma around mental health. 'Silly ideas like making people suffering from mental health issues wear wristbands would only increase the discrimination and stigma around mental health, rather than end it.' Mr Clegg told MailOnline: 'The Liberal Democrats have spent many years campaigning for an end to the stigma around mental health' Miriam Gonzalez Durantez (right), the wife of Liberal Democrats leader Nick Clegg, joined the party's candidate for Hazel Grove, in Stockport, Lisa Smart (left) Julian Huppert, the Lib Dem candidate and Cambridge MP, said: 'I was really shocked at the suggestion that people with mental health problems should be expected to wear wristbands to identify themselves.' Mr Huppert said: 'I have fought hard for many years against the stigma people with mental health problems face. There is already far too much discrimination against mental health throughout our society, and a wristband saying 'I am depressed' is not going to help. 'We need to massively improve mental health support, which has been not good enough for many decades. I hope Chamali regrets her comments and will think carefully about her attitude to mental illness in the future.' Political blogger Richard Taylor reported Ms Fernando's comments at last night's hustings . The Conservative candidate insisted her remarks were 'distorted', adding: 'It was not that they should wear a wristband. That would be draconian' Ms Fernando has insisted that her comments were 'taken out of context'. She said: 'The question that was asked is how authorities, such as the police, could better deal with mental health issues. 'At Cambridge National Autistic Hustings the chairman of CNAS said he carries a green card in his wallet to identify his condition. 'There are people who have come into contact with the police and due to an underlying mental health condition are unable to communicate their condition. 'It was not that they should wear a wristband. That would be draconian.'"
"Jenny Rathbone said some tenants were charged ??150 to have properties taken off the market while a contract was finalised, while others charged ??65 for cleaning the property.
The Cardiff Central AM called for a ban on the charging of such fees.
Ministers have warned of a risk that banning fees would push up rents.
In Scotland, all charges to private tenants other than rent and deposits have been deemed illegal since 2012.
Campaigners have called for similar rules in other parts of the UK.
In a Senedd debate, Ms Rathbone said: ""It should be the landlord paying the letting agency, not the tenant.""
She added: ""Frankly, the letting agencies are getting away with simply not providing a service in exchange for the fee and I think it's something that needs to be stopped as a matter of urgency.""
Assembly lawyers have told Ms Rathbone that Wales had the legal powers to impose a ban, despite the Welsh Government previously saying it did not have the authority.
Communities Secretary Carl Sargeant said agents were legally obliged to advertise fees, and he was ""not persuaded"" a ban was needed at this time.
""I wouldn't want to see the fees - extortionate fees in some cases - just being transferred to the tenant [in the form of higher rents],"" he said.
""I would like to learn from the evidence from the experience in Scotland before deciding whether this measure is necessary,"" Mr Sargeant added.

"A playground in Tokyo has been found to have dangerously high levels of radiation, which has raised fears for the health of children in the area. Soil underneath a slide at the park in the Toshima ward in the north-east of the Japanese capital, showed radiation readings of up to 480 microsieverts per hour. This is nearly half the recommended annual limit of exposure for a person. Danger: Japanese authorities detected an unusually high level of radiation around playground equipment in this Tokyo park (pictured) Safety: Authorities cordoned off the park after high levels of radiation were detected underneath a slide . It was not immediately clear why radiation levels were so high in the park, which opened two years after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Authorities believe that the radiation could be coming from something buried underneath the park. The playground has now been fenced off with an orange barricade. Park representative Kyoko Tsujimura said: 'We are still checking what caused these elevated radiation levels and what type of radioactive substance it is.' The city has set up a health advice office to answer queries from concerned parents. According to the International Commission on Radiological Protection recommendations, members of the public should not be exposed to more than 1000 microsieverts per year. Japan has seen heightened concern over radiation since the 2011 failure of a nuclear plant in Fukushima following an earthquake and tsunami, which led to leaks of radioactive water. In the months after the nuclear meltdowns, concerned parents and citizens began measuring radiation levels in Tokyo schools and parks. Thousands of people are still living in temporary shelters and have been unable to return home in areas closest to Tokyo Electric Power's nuclear plant. Elsewhere, a drone with a small amount of radiation was found on Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's office building this week. Clean up: Workers carry away a container after extremely high levels of radiation were detected in the park . Tests: Following two rounds of testing, officials found high levels of radiation on a section of the equipment ."

"A terminally-ill landlord whose dying wish was to marry his partner of 26 years saw their special day descend into farce after a series of blunders. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and the pair settled on a venue close to their home. But, instead of having the magical day they had planned, the couple were left reeling after a number of bungles thwarted the ceremony from running smoothly. Guests were forced to listen to the wedding song 10 times while it played over and over, and the couple were left with three marriage certificates after officials got crucial details wrong on the first two. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather, 54, after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer but the couple's special day (pictured) was full of blunders . Guests at the couple's (pictured) wedding were forced to listen to the song 'Wonderful Life' 10 times in a row due to a blunder and their marriage certificate was recorded with the wrong date on, rendering it invalid . Mr Haigh, who died weeks after the ceremony in November last year, was left so devastated by the day that he told his wife that he felt like he'd let her down. In fact, the day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House in the city centre, where the pair said their vows. Mrs Haigh, 54, said: 'Geoff was heartbroken by it all. He kept apologising to me and saying he'd wished we'd got married years earlier and done it properly. 'He was devastated, as the way he saw it, this was his final gesture for me and it had been ruined by their thoughtlessness.' The couple had initially dreamed of getting married abroad once Mr Haigh discovered his advanced pancreatic cancer was terminal. However, the landlord of The Ram's Head pub, in Oldham, was distraught to discover that his tumour was too large for him to fly safely. The pair then settled upon the Manchester venue as it was not too far from their home. It took three people two hours to get Mr Haigh ready for his big day and, determined to make the day perfect for his bride-to-be, he battled through pain to make it to the venue. Mrs Haigh, 54, said every guest at the ceremony -  held in November last year in Manchester  -  wrote a letter of complaint. She has three marriage certificates (pictured) as the first two were riddled with errors . The couple had an examiner testing the registrar doing their ceremony (pictured) and were given an invalid marriage certificate as it featured the wrong date. An amended version posted later was full spelling errors . However, it was upon their arrival at the venue that the catalogue of errors began. They said they found the register office dirty and claimed they were forced to wipe dirt from the seats before they sat down. Then they noticed a woman sat at the back as they said their vows, which turned out to be an examiner testing the registrar. Mrs Haigh, a mother of three, said: 'There was some random woman sat at the back who none of us knew and it was only after I asked I was told she was assessing the registrar to see how she did on the day. Geoff Haigh and his wife Heather endured a catalogue of blunders during their wedding day. 'It felt like they were merely using us a practice go, like our special day was not the real thing or of any importance to them.' After the bride and groom said their vows, guests were left on their own to the sound of their bridal music 'Wonderful Life' while the registrar went out of the room. Unbelievably, almost half an hour passed before she returned and the song played 10 times over before Mrs Haigh was compelled to take action. She said: 'Everyone was groaning when the song kept coming back on. We couldn't believe it. 'It had been a special song for us but it is definitely tainted by that day now.' After the ceremony, as they went off to enjoy their wedding reception at city centre restaurant San Carlos, the couple were informed that they would have to return to the register office as officials had logged the wrong date on their marriage certificate. They were instructed to go back to the venue to have the gaffe corrected, otherwise their marriage was invalid. Mrs Haigh told officials that her husband was too ill and could barely walk so they would have to post the amended certificate instead. However, when the second certificate arrived in the post, it was addressed to Mrs Haigh in her maiden name 'Taylor' and included spelling errors on the document. A third certificate then had to be posted out to the couple. Mr Haigh (above) passed away in January this year, just weeks after his wedding to long-term partner Heather. The couple decided they wanted to get married when he was diagnosed as terminal late last year . Mrs Haigh (left) said her new husband (right) was left devastated by the series of blunders and said he felt like he had let her down. She has received £137 from the Manchester register office following the calamity day . Mrs Haigh said: 'It felt like they didn't recognise we were married and that really hurt Geoff before he died. 'It made if feel like the whole thing didn't happen, like it meant nothing at all. It was devastating. 'The guests were all in tears for us. They were all absolutely disgusted and no one could believe the day could have gone so atrociously.' The newlyweds were offered a £137 refund but Mrs Haigh said they were told by the register office that there was not a significant enough 'loss' to warrant compensation. She said: 'It wasn't about the money, but to say there was no loss ignores the emotional cost it took on my husband. 'It was the arrogance and flippant attitude that hurt even more. They said ""we all make mistakes and we are only human"". 'That's fine when you make mistakes in a restaurant with someone's food but when you are dealing with a terminally ill man's dying wish and the most special day of our lives, that attitude is not acceptable.' The wedding day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House (pictured)  in the city centre, where the pair said their vows . The family has since received an apology from Manchester City Council, which runs the register office based at Heron House. A spokesman said: 'I'd like to offer our sincerest apologies to Mrs Taylor as the ceremony did not meet her expectations. 'These types of problems are thankfully exceptionally rare and our registry staff are incredibly conscientious. They understand that they play a vital role in the most important day of a couple's life and would never knowingly do anything to spoil or delay a wedding.' However, tragically, Mr Haigh died on January 4 this year before receiving the apology. His wife added: 'Geoff was determined not to die over Christmas because he said it would ruin it for everyone after he was gone for years to come, and he didn't want that for us. The energy it took from him to hang on, I couldn't believe.'"
"What Alastair Cook did here, particularly in the first hour of his innings, was spot-on. That has to be his template from now on and if he carries on the way he has played here in Grenada, those hundreds will come again. This was really encouraging for the England captain but ultimately hugely frustrating because he couldn’t push on to that all-important hundred. Cook’s problem has been opponents stopping him scoring in areas where he has always been prolific. He has struggled when he has looked to make runs with shots that he rarely employed before. Alastair Cook's innings into day three in Grenada was spot on, particularly the first hour of it . Cook worked his way to an encouraging 50 but frustratingly was out playing Shannon Gabriel on for 76 . Yet it is nonsense to say a batsman who has hit 25 Test hundreds cannot drive the ball. Of course he can. The key for him is not to play the drive too early, when the ball is moving around and his balance at the crease is not quite right. Perhaps it has been playing too much one-day cricket, perhaps it has just been the pressure to score big runs again, but Cook has been searching for the ball far too early. Here he left the ball outside off stump and made the bowlers come to him, which took a lot of mental strength and composure. The drag-on was always going to be a danger on this pitch but Cook was right to try to play that shot because the cut is one of his big strengths. His eyes lit up when he was bowled a short, wide one by Shannon Gabriel. But the ball just lacked pace, Cook was through the shot too early, the angle from round the wicket tucked him up and the inside edge came into play. He cannot admonish himself for playing at the delivery. Boy, do I admire Cook’s fortitude and the concentration he showed on that sluggish pitch with an incredibly slow outfield. The England captain hits behind square on the onside as Jermaine Blackwood ducks for cover . Cook left the ball outside off stump and made the bowlers come to him, but drove when the option arose . He is stronger mentally than anyone he will face, so he just has to carry on showing the same discipline. The bowlers will become bored before he does. The fact is, 76 here was pretty much worth a hundred in these day-three conditions, but sadly for Cook that is not how the record books will show it. The England captain was aided by the fact the ball did not swing much for West Indies, because it is the moving delivery that has caused him so many problems. It is to Cook’s credit that he has not looked under pressure in this second Test and his recent statistics — four scores of 70-plus in his last seven Test innings — are absolutely fine for a normal human being. The problem for him is that until the age of 28 he wasn’t normal; he was an absolute run machine. Cook's off stump is rattled after a wide delivery from Gabriel found the inside edge . The skipper shows his frustration as his impressive innings to this point is cut short . Gabriel celebrates after Cook's eyes lit but the ball just lacked pace and he was through the shot too early . West Indies celebrate the breakthrough  but Cook cannot admonish himself for playing at the delivery . Cook just has to put that one key statistic to bed and finally reach three figures, then move on with such a big summer ahead. His inability to do so means we are still talking about how long it’s been since his last Test century but there were good signs here. Meanwhile, Jonathan Trott still looked a little frenetic at the start of his innings, certainly for those first 10 to 15 runs when he was searching for the ball and driving when he did not need to. Jonathan Trott drives during his first innings of 59, which started day three somewhat frenetically . Cook congratulates a smiling Trott after his fellow opener reached his 50 milestone in the morning session . Yet as his innings progressed, he looked calmer and it was significant when he started walking off towards square leg between deliveries. He was in his little bubble again and it showed me that he was back. Trott has obviously been through a heck of a lot, has looked anxious and wants to prove the point that he belongs back with England and that he can open the batting in Tests. The more he played, the more he looked like Jonathan Trott. Trott looked calmer as his innings went on but Devendra Bishoo found his edge before he could go on with it . Trott leaves the field at St George's - on St George's Day - after an opening partnership of 125 runs ."
"Arsenal's eight-match winning streak in the Premier League has taken even manager Arsene Wenger by surprise, according to the Frenchman whose side retain an outside chance of winning the title. 'I always hope to get the best out of my team, but no manager in the world if he is serious can predict a run like this,' Wenger told Arsenal's website. 'In the Premier League it's very difficult to predict.' Arsene Wenger admits he could not have predicted Arsenal's impressive run of results . Aaron Ramsey's goal against Burnley extended the Gunners' record to 16 wins in their last 18 games . Wenger has once again come under fire this season, with fans frustrated by Arsenal's failure to mount a serious title challenge and another last-16 exit in the Champions League. However, with an FA Cup semi-final this weekend and still the chance to chase down Chelsea in the table, Wenger's position at Arsenal is again looking secure. Arsenal have won 16 of 18 games in all competitions and Wenger believes the change in fortune is down to him finally having a relatively injury-free squad. 'It's down to the quality and the attitude of the team, the quality of the spirit we have in the side,' he said. Ramsey celebrates his goal, which helped Arsenal to maintain second place in the Premier League . Arsenal have a slim chance of winning the league, but they must catch Jose Mourinho's Chelsea to do so . 'We prepare (well), we prepare and contribute to our success, that is for sure. What people forgot is that we had big players out for four months this season. 'Six or seven players from the squad completely out. So that made a big difference. 'We have a better balance in the team and some players have made it like (Francis) Coquelin, who contributes to the balance of the team. Hector Bellerin as well has come into the team. 'And big players like (Laurent) Koscielny, like (Mesut) Ozil, like (Olivier) Giroud have been out four months in the season -- four months the three together! 'I have a quality bench and we even have quality players at home like Chamberlain, Arteta, Wilshere. I didn't even try to play Debuchy. We have a big squad and I think we have quality. 'Let's see how we finish the season and after see how we do next season.' Arsenal face Championship side Reading in the FA Cup semi-final this weekend and host Chelsea the following week."
"The head of the mission, Peter Graaff, met the Ghanaian president to thank the country for hosting the agency since it was set up in September last year.
A small team will stay until the end of June to co-ordinate air operations, the agency, known as Unmeer, said.
Ghana has not been affected by the epidemic in West Africa, which has killed more than 11,000 people.
Africa news: Tuesday 9 June as it happens
Why Ebola is so dangerous
Ebola basics: What you need to know
The BBC's Africa health correspondent Anne Soy says the mission set up its headquarters in Accra as it was far enough away from the affected countries, where there was logistical lockdown, but close enough the epicentre of the outbreak.
""By allowing us to set up our headquarter in Accra, President [John ] Mahama demonstrated extraordinary leadership and solidarity,"" Mr Graaff said in a statement.
""He made Ghana the only open gateway to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone thus allowing the movement of thousands of Ebola responders and medical and essential supplies when they were most needed.""
As a result, Unmeer said Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone now had the necessary response capabilities in place to efficiently test, treat and isolate Ebola patients.

President Mahama said the downsizing of Unmeer was a sign of success for ""short and sharp interventions"".
Most of the mission's staff and assets have been moved to Sierra Leone and Guinea, where 24 new cases of Ebola were reported in the last week.
Last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Liberia free of Ebola as the country had had no new cases in 42 days.

"For 10 days from 29 April 1945, Operation Manna dropped nearly 7,000 tonnes of food over The Netherlands.
The country had lost 20,000 people through starvation, with a further 980,000 classed as malnourished.
The bulbs were donated by the Dutch government to the International Bomber Command Centre (IBCC).
A ceremony at the cathedral to unveil the mosaic was attended by representatives from The Netherlands, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Poland, Germany and the US.
Bomber Command veterans also met with some who had been helped by the campaign.
Nicky Barr, from the IBCC, an education facility being built in Lincoln, said Operation Manna was the difference between ""people living or dying"".
The mission followed a blockade of supplies by German forces in retaliation for Dutch rail companies going on strike in support of an Allied offensive, she said.
The winter of 1944/45 was also particularly harsh, compounding the problem of food shortages.
David Fellows, who flew missions from RAF Binbrook in Lincolnshire as part of Operation Manna, said: ""We used to go across to Holland every fifth year and we used to get hugs from young children who would say 'thank you for saving my grandmother', but to meet some of the people who were there at the time is highly emotional.""
Recalling the missions, he said: ""We knew there were thousands of Dutch people dying - and they were in dire straits.""
He said despite concerns the Germans ""could open fire on us, the RAF being the RAF took the decision to fly anyway"".
He added he was proud to have been part of such an important campaign."
"Profits fell to £14m compared with £32m a year earlier.
That fall is partly due to the costs of last year's serious cyber attack,  which cost the company £42m.
Dido Harding, TalkTalk chief executive told the BBC: ""We have significantly increased our spending on security. We take this extremely seriously.""
Talktalk lost 101,000 subscribers in its third quarter after the attack, which resulted in the personal data of nearly 160,000 people being accessed.
The data haul netted email addresses, names and phone numbers. 21,000 unique bank account numbers and sort codes were accessed in the attack.
There have been six arrests in the UK connected with the hacking, all of them of individuals under 21 years old.
Ms Harding said: ""I am actually very encouraged by the way the business has bounced back so strongly in the last quarter.
""The customer base has really stabilised and this is testimony to the fact that our customers really appreciated our open and honest approach and how we tried to look after them through the cyber attack.""
She added that Talktalk's customer ""churn"" - the turnover of customers - has been the lowest in TalkTalk's history, suggesting customers are satisfied with the company's service.
TalkTalk says total revenues grew 2.4% to £1.83bn in the 12 months to 31 March."
"Mother-of-two Anna Tilley survived after spending four days in intensive care with blood poisoning, pictured with her son Harry . Patients’ lives are at risk from blood poisoning because hospitals are not implementing a standard treatment that can double their chances of survival, experts have warned. Sepsis, previously known as septicaemia, affects more than 100,000 Britons a year and kills 37,000 – more than breast, bowel and prostate cancer combined. Now a snapshot NHS study reveals that on one surgical ward at a leading teaching hospital, 90 per cent of patients failed to get the correct treatment, involving a simple set of lifesaving measures known as Sepsis Six. After high-profile campaigns in 2013 which exposed the shocking death rates, the method was officially recommended by NHS England. Yet an audit, revealed at the annual president’s meeting of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in March, showed that vital steps in the process are being missed, meaning the condition was more likely to take hold with fatal consequences. The College is now calling for nationwide tracking of the protocol to weed out hospitals that are failing to tackle the problem. Sepsis Six involves blood tests to check for infection; testing the level of lactate, a chemical produced when cells are starved of oxygen; giving oxygen and IV fluids to protect organs and raise dangerously low blood pressure; checking urine hourly to monitor fluid levels and kidney function; and administering antibiotics to clear any underlying infection. The study of 23 patients with sepsis at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary revealed just one in ten had their lactate levels tested. Only 40 per cent were given oxygen, and staff failed to measure urine output in nearly a third of cases. Dr Ron Daniels, chief executive of the UK Sepsis Trust who helped devise Sepsis Six, warns that, despite being a small sample, the finding of the study was far from unusual. ‘Sadly this and other studies show patients are not getting access to a treatment that saves lives. Every one of the six steps is vitally important, and nothing should be missed out.’ Some 90 per cent of patients were not given correct treatment to prevent blood poisoning on a surgical ward at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, an NHS study revealed . Sepsis occurs when the immune system overreacts to an infection, causing multiple organ failure if not treated quickly. It can be triggered by an infection in any part of the body, most commonly the lungs, urinary tract, abdomen and pelvis. It is often a problem that develops while in hospital, after surgery. Those with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or cancer are at increased risk. Symptoms include slurred speech, muscle pain, mottled or discoloured skin, poor urine output and severe breathlessness. ‘Delays in the identification and treatment of sepsis can have serious consequences for patients,’ says Dr Seng Wong, who carried out the Edinburgh audit. His research also found Sepsis Six awareness improved after a three-month staff training and a poster campaign. More than half of subsequent patients had their lactate measured, 60 per cent were given oxygen and 90 per cent had their urine measured. Mother-of-two Anna Tilley knows only too well the importance of staff awareness. Four days after Anna developed a sore throat, aches and pains and a high temperature, she was hallucinating, had a mottled rash and was struggling to breathe. ‘My parents carried me to the doctor’s and insisted my GP call an ambulance,’ says Anna. ‘At A&E I waited four hours in a side room. Although I had typical symptoms of sepsis, none of the doctors recognised I was dying.’ The 26-year-old from West Sussex says she was just hours from death when a quick-thinking doctor spotted the danger signs. Anna spent four days in intensive care on oxygen and antibiotics after her liver, kidneys and pancreas all failed. ‘I later learned that without treatment, I would have died in my sleep that night,’ Anna adds. ‘Awareness needs to be raised of this awful condition, which takes so many lives.’"
"Cumbernauld has the dubious distinction of winning the Plook on the Plinth title for having Scotland's ""most dismal"" town centre in 2001 and 2005.
Judges have compared it to Kabul and described its shopping centre as a rabbit warren on stilts.
Now an online poll has seen it top a public vote for civic pride.
The Scottish Design Awards is organised by Urban Realm - which also organises the Carbuncle awards.
During the past few weeks of online voting, Cumbernauld residents helped the town move ahead of rivals such as Broughty Ferry, Dunkeld, East Kilbride, Eaglesham Linlithgow, Peebles and Pitlochry.
When the polls closed at midnight on Thursday, Cumbernauld had narrowly beaten Peebles.
The prize will be collected by a delegation from the town at a ceremony in Glasgow on Friday evening.
The Carbuncle Awards were created by Gordon Young, now editor of The Drum, one of the sponsors of the Scottish Design Awards.
He said: ""The initial complaints against the town concerned the disastrous design of the town centre.
""There has been some investment in that area but the level of improvement is not great.
""However, Cumbernauld's real success story is how it has prospered despite these problems.""
Mr Young said ""the surrounding countryside, the high demand for housing, rich and diverse suburbs, transport links to Glasgow and Edinburgh and a vibrant community spirit"" had all helped make Cumbernauld ""a decent place to bring up a family"".
He added: ""Basically, economic success plus people power have made it a nice place to live."""
"Joseph Smith was not in a booster seat and suffered multiple injuries when the car he was in smashed into oncoming traffic on Cardiff's Western Avenue.
Dean Collins was found guilty of causing death and causing serious injury by dangerous driving on Tuesday.
The 24-year-old, from St Mellons, was sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court.
He was also handed a three-year sentence for the serious injury charges, which will run concurrently, and has been banned from driving for eight years.
The Recorder of Cardiff, Eleri Rees QC, told Collins: ""You have never acknowledged any fault despite overwhelming evidence it was entirely your fault.
""The obvious inference is that you allowed yourself to become distracted.
""The general manner of your driving was impatient and a general disregard for road safety.""
She said he also showed a ""blatant disregard"" for the safety of his four passengers, had shown arrogance and an aggressive manner of driving immediately before the crash.
The judge criticised his ""cavalier attitude"" to both his own safety and that if others, adding the lack of a car booster seat had contributed to Joseph's injuries.
The trial heard Collins - who had denied all the charges - was driving a borrowed Ford Focus carrying his partner Laura Bright, 23, her mother Michelle Holmes, Joseph, and the couple's two-year-old daughter at the time of the crash.
The car crossed a central reservation on Western Avenue and slammed into a white Seat Ibiza heading in the opposite direction.
Collins' driving before the collision had been erratic, with the car weaving in and out of traffic and undertaking other vehicles.
Blood samples taken from Collins after the collision contained traces of cocaine.
But the quantity was too small to accurately measure and a toxicologist said it was not possible to say how the drug would have affected Collins' actions.
Collins, who had passed his driving test just three months before, said he had no memory of the crash and insisted it was a ""tragic accident"".
Four others suffered injuries in the crash, including fractures to the spine, arms, legs, ribs, memory loss and blindness in one eye.
Joseph's mother Laura Bright, who has since married Collins, was unconscious for five days after the crash.
She was cleared at a previous hearing of causing the death of a child in her care.
The court heard she was now pregnant with his third child.
South Wales Police investigating officer PC Tony Farr, of the Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said the crash had had a ""devastating impact on so many lives"".
""I cannot stress enough how dangerous vehicles can be when they are in the hands of the wrong people,"" he said.
""Collins was inexperienced and evidence presented to the court showed he had taken drugs in the days or hours before the collision. Tragically, that proved to be a lethal combination.
""Collins also failed to ensure Joseph was seated securely in the vehicle - again a huge error in judgement that he will now have to live with for the rest of his life.""
Speaking after the hearing, Joseph's father, Tom Smith, said of the crash: ""It's traumatised me, I don't sleep, all I do is think about that little boy.""
Ann Haile of the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""This case is a stark reminder of how dangerous moving vehicles are when they are not controlled properly, and how important it is for children to be in a suitable, properly fitted car seat."""
"Trott hit 175 as Warwickshire totalled 413 at Taunton, backed by half-centuries from Tim Ambrose (63) and Rikki Clarke (57).
Young paceman Grant Thornton then took two of the four Somerset wickets to fall on his Championship debut.
But Marcus Trescothick was still there at the close on 41, out of 94-4.
After two badly rain-interrupted days. the draw remains the most likely result.
But the Bears, so badly beaten by an innings in their opening two matches, have at least given themselves a chance of forcing victory, although it would take 16 wickets in the day to do it - and getting Trescothick out twice.
Bottom club Somerset's target on day four will simply be to avoid the follow-on - and they need a further 170 to do that.
Somerset's Marcus Trescothick told BBC Radio Bristol:
""One of the office staff told me around 10 days ago how close I was to 25,000 runs and I have been sweating on it since then.
""I knew when I went in that I was 29 away. It got a bit tense as I moved closer.
""It is an achievement I am proud of but there is still a big job for me to do in this game.
""It wasn't a great day for us and we need to concentrate hard tomorrow to make sure we come away with a draw.""
Warwickshire's Jonathan Trott told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire:
""It's great that Marcus is still playing county cricket and setting an example to the young players in his dressing room and opposition teams.
""There is no chance I will be still be playing at 41. That's just silly! His will be a huge wicket for us tomorrow.
""I had just got past 100 when the new ball was taken so it was important I hung around for longer if we were to get a decent score. I started to think in terms of 400 when Rikki Clarke came in and played so well.
""There is a bit of turn because it is a used pitch. With so much rain, the crustiness has taken longer to form, but hopefully Jeetan Patel can cause them a few problems."""
"Ronnie O’Sullivan took off his shoes mid-match at the Crucible on Tuesday — but still socked it to debutant Craig Steadman. The Rocket raced into a 7-2 lead in his first match at this year’s Betfred World Championship in Sheffield. But five-time champion O’Sullivan, 39, could now face a fine after breaching snooker’s strict dress code against the 32-year-old from Manchester. Ronnie O'Sullivan was forced into borrowing a pair of shoes from a member of the Crucible audience . O'Sullivan played a frame of his encounter against fellow Englishman Craig Steadman in his socks . O'Sullivan leans across the table as he lines up a shot during the first round of the World Championship . O’Sullivan almost made a 147 maximum break in the first frame — missing the 14th red on a run of 104. But he played the sixth frame in his socks after removing some new shoes, complaining about a painful big toe. O’Sullivan saw his lead pegged back to 4-2 after losing that frame — and tried to hand his footwear to a fan. He also asked: ‘Does anyone in here have some size eight or nine shoes I can borrow. I’m serious?’ But tournament director Mike Ganley summoned him out of the arena and lent him his own shoes for the last three frames of the session. The WPBSA dress code reads: ‘Each member shall ensure that their dress and appearance is smart and appropriate for a professional player.’ O’Sullivan was given dispensation to wear casual shoes last year at the UK Championship after breaking his ankle. O'Sullivan claimed he was in discomfort during the match due to an injury he sustained in November . The five-time world champion talks with referee Brendan Moore after borrowing a pair of shoes . O'Sullivan (left) holds an overnight 7-2 first-round lead against Craig Steadman (right) World Championship (5): 2001, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2013. Masters (5): 1995, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2014. UK Championship (5): 1994, 1998, 2002, 2008, 2015. World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn said: ‘The one thing you can be sure of with Ronnie O’Sullivan is that you have absolutely no idea what he is going to do next. ‘I would rather he played with his shoes on if it all possible though. And what happens if his trousers are a bit tight in the next session of his match?’ Meanwhile, Ding Junhui blew the chance to win £30,000 and become only the seventh player to make a maximum at the Crucible. He incredibly played for the blue after the 13th red following 12 blacks and only gasps from the crowd alerted him to the blunder. Ding looked stunned before a doomed long-distance attempt on the black failed. However, he shrugged off the setback to claim a 10-7 victory. Ding, who now plays John Higgins in the second round, said: ‘I was concentrating so hard I forgot. I had been 4-0 behind and doing everything to get back into the match, and already thinking about trying to win the next frame. ‘I only realised what I had done after playing for the blue because the crowd reacted. Then I checked the scoreboard. Hopfully one day I will get another chance to make a 147 at the Crucible, but it was a bit embarrassing.’ Ali Carter, a two-time Crucible finalist, looked in good touch in his first match at the venue since being given the all-clear from lung cancer. O'Sullivan took to Twitter to post a picture of his inflamed left ankle back in November 2014 . Following a 10-5 win over Alan McManus to set up a clash with Neil Robertson, he said: ‘This is where I feel comfortable and most enjoy playing. I have done everything here except win it and that’s what I am here to do. I didn’t want to come here, get some applause, play like an idiot and go home.’ Mark Allen won an incredible nine frames in a row from 3-1 down to blow away Ryan Day 10-3. The 29-year-old from Northern Ireland, who now plays Barry Hawkins, said: ‘That doesn’t happen very often at this level. But that was my C game. Ryan gave the chances rather than me earning them. I will need to play a lot better to be in the mix for the title.’"
"Police searched an area near a Ford Motor Company plant in Michigan on Sunday for clues related to the disappearance of a woman who was last seen at Halloween wearing a Poison Ivy costume . Chelsea Ellen Bruck, 22, has been missing almost six months, police said. Monroe County Sheriff's Major Jeff Kemp reported that the search was arranged after investigators received a tip from a citizen about the area in Flat Rock. 'All I can say … is we're looking for evidence,' the sheriff's office said. He declined to discuss media reports that part of Chelsea's costume were found. Scroll down for video . A new search was conducted on Sunday in the case of missing Chelsea Ellen Bruck, 22, who was last seen dressed as Batman villain Poison Ivy at a Halloween party on October 25 attended by around 800 people . Miss Bruck, 22, from Maybee has not been seen since the early hours of October 26, 2014 despite extensive searches on foot and by helicopter to locate her . The Maybee woman was dressed as the comic villain Poison Ivy when she attended a Halloween party October 26 in Frenchtown Township. The costume included a leaf-covered top and dark purple wig. That was the last time she was seen at the outdoor party at a rural farmhouse which was attended by around 800 people, 35 miles southwest of Detroit. Her mother, Leannda Bruck, told AP that detectives were actively working on the case but declined to say anything else. Sheriff's deputies and Flat Rock police conducted the search on Sunday night focusing on an area near the Flat Rock Assembly Plant. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from the Flat Rock police department on Monday. Jennifer Bruck, left, prays for sister Chelsea with parents Matt and Leannda Bruck and other family and friends who turned to public prayer in Monroe, Michigan last October. She has not been seen for six months . Police have interviewed multiple people and investigated hundreds of tips over the past six months. A witness reported seeing Miss Bruck walking about 3am with a man as the party was winding down.The sheriff's office published a sketch of the man she was seen with in a parking lot. The dark-haired man had thin stubble and wore glasses with a black hoodie. The man has not been identified and police have not named him as a suspect. Two were charged separating for telling police lies about the missing woman. In a missing person appeal, Chelsea Bruck is described as 5'7' tall, 140lbs, blonde, with a small anchor tattoo behind her right ear. She was last seen wearing black yoga pants, a black wig and a leaf-covered vest. Anyone with information about the case is asked to call the Monroe County Sheriff's Office at (734) 240-7700 or Monroe County Central Dispatch at (734) 243-7070. Authorities released this sketch of the man Miss Bruck was seen with in a parking lot around 3am following a party in Frenchtown Township, Michigan just before Halloween . Her sister, Kassandra Bruck, 24, told the Detroit Free Press last year that the family is encouraging people to share photos of Chelsea - across Michigan and beyond. She told NBC: 'This is 100% uncharacteristic, it's not anything she would do. She even told my mom, ''I'm not staying long. I'll be back in a couple of hours.'' This has just broken my parents.' Ms Bruck told CBS on Monday that she was 'very hopeful' her sister would be found alive. The party host Mike Williams, 30, told the paper he had been forced to close the party, intended for 500 people, after around 800 revelers turned up. He added that he hadn't seen Miss Bruck at the party at all. A GoFundMe campaign to help find Miss Bruck has raised close to $9,000. Missing posters offered a close-up of an anchor-shaped tattoo behind Miss Bruck's right ear ."
"A nine-year-old girl who plummeted 30ft headfirst down the inside of a hollow tree claims she 'went to heaven and sat in Jesus's lap' while unconscious after the fall. Her mother, Christy Wilson Beam, 42, has spoken of her amazement after  Annabel, now 12, escaped the horrifying accident unscathed - even waking miraculously cured of a devastating illness that had plagued her childhood. For the first time in her life, she can eat solid food – and her mother thinks her brush with Jesus is the reason why. Scroll down for video . Annabel Beam, now 12, believes she visited Heaven when unconscious after falling 30ft at the age of nine . Annabel (centre), with her mother Christy and father Kevin and her sisters Abigail (right) and Adelynn (left) In December, 2011, Annabel was playing outside the family's Texas home with her sisters Abigail, now 14 and Adelynn, now ten, when she slipped and fell inside a hollowed-out cottonwood tree. Mum Christy said: 'She hit her head three times on the way down and this is consistent with the findings of an MRI scan. 'With the facts in front of me now, I see it all with sickening clarity. 'Sometimes at night, it replays in my head – a dark twist on Alice tumbling down the rabbit hole.' An emergency fire crew managed to harness Annabel to safety and she was rushed to Cook Children's Hospital in Fort Worth in a helicopter. Fearing the worst, medics prepped brain and spinal injury teams to stand by for Annabel's arrival – but, incredibly, she survived without a scratch. Video: Today . Annabel survived the horrific fall with only bumps and bruises. The doctors said 'I guess someone up there was looking out for her' Annabel's mother, Christy, and father, Kevin, believe their daughter, saying she 'has no interest in melodrama' Doctors told her relieved parents: 'I guess someone up there was looking out for her.' 'The ER doc told us the one thing we weren't expecting to hear,' her mother said. 'He said, ""Other than a possibly concussion and some superficial bumps and bruises, she doesn't appear to have been injured at all."" '[My husband] Kevin and I exchanged a look of pure astonishment.' In the days following the accident, Annabel began to talk of religious visions she experienced while lying unconscious. She told her parents: 'I went to heaven when I was in that tree. I sat in Jesus' lap.' 'I saw in Anna's eyes the conscious decision to confide in us,' Christy said. 'There was no drama, she wasn't playing either. 'This wasn't like one of her long, spun-out recaps of a funny dream or movie she'd seen. 'She'd been through enough real drama in her short life. She had no interest in melodrama. '[She described] some of what she'd experienced while inside the tree – how the gates of Heaven are made of gold, how Jesus told her it wasn't time.' A cross marks the hollowed-out cottonwood tree, where Annabel plummeted 30ft headfirst to the bottom . Initially, Christy was concerned that Annabel was indicating a head injury, but MRI and CT scans revealed she had not sustained one. Further tests also revealed Annabel had remarkably stopped displaying symptoms of pseudo-obstruction motility disorder, a rare incurable condition that had seen her in and out of hospital since 2008. Doctors advised she could begin to come off the antibiotics she had been taking for years. Instead of taking ten different types of medication throughout the day, she only needed three, and the painkillers that were prescribed 'as and when she needed them' were not required at all. Previously, Annabel's medication meant she had to have a liquid diet or stick to soft, bland food – but now, she can happily tuck into pizzas and McDonald's happy meals. The family have gone more than a year without a single visit to the doctor. 'I can't explain what happened to her physically while she was in that tree,' said her father Kevin. 'All I have to go on is the radiological data and the medical records from before and after. 'The proof is in the pudding. She wasn't well before and now she is. 'All I know beyond that is that she believes she went to Heaven. And I believe her when she tells me she believes it.' Nine-year-old Annabel was playing outside with her sisters Abigail and Adelynn when she fell inside the tree . Annabel said she saw a fairy-like guardian angel as she gained consciousness, and it stayed with her while she was rescued, shining a light so she could see . Annabel talked of seeing a 'guardian angel' as she came to. The schoolgirl said: 'I started to wake up in the tree and I could hear the firemen's voices. And I saw an angel that looked very small, like a fairy. 'And the God winked at me through the body of the angel and what He was saying to me was, 'I'm going to leave you now and everything is going to be okay. 'And then the angel stayed with me the entire time, shining a light so I could see. We didn't talk. We just sat together peacefully.' She also spoke of seeing Mimi, her great-grandmother who'd died in 2010 after surgery on a blocked intestine. When asked what Jesus looked like, Annabel said: 'He had a beautiful long white robe, dark skin and a big beard – kinda like Santa Claus, but not really.'"
"A heartbroken pensioner is believed to have killed himself six days after his wife's death by jumping from a bridge at their 'special place' where they used to take romantic walks together. John Lord, 86, went missing from his home on April 6 less than a week after his beloved wife June, 81, died from a 'catastrophic bleed' to the brain. His family feared the worst after discovering a note describing how much he missed his wife of 63 years and how he could not live without her. Double tragedy: John Lord, 86, went missing from his home on April 6 less than a week after his beloved wife June, 81, pictured together on their wedding anniversary, died from a 'catastrophic bleed' to the brain . Nottinghamshire Police launched an appeal in a bid to track down the grandfather-of-three on the day he disappeared from his home in St Ann's, Nottingham. Today officers confirmed a body pulled from the River Trent on April 15 by a specialist underwater search unit was sadly that of the missing pensioner. His family believe he may have killed himself at the picturesque beauty spot where the devoted couple enjoyed going for a walk. Message: Mr Lord's daughter Alison said her father was grieving and had left a heartbreaking note signed 'love to all' and described how he could not live without his wife . Mr Lord's last known moments were also captured on CCTV as he parked his white Toyota Yaris car near close to the Trent at 3.15am on April 6. The footage then shows the pensioner walking toward a bridge, which was the last sighting of him. His daughter, Alison Lord, 56, said her father was grieving and had left a heartbreaking note signed 'love to all.' Speaking before his death, the teaching assistant, who lives in Bulwell, Nottingham, added: 'He did leave a note. 'It said he couldn't live without June, and he apologised and said ""love to all"". 'It was completely out of character for him to get up and drive his car in the middle of the night.' Ms Lord said her parents, who were members of a local church, had been 'inseparable' and her mum's death had left the whole family devastated. A Nottinghamshire Police spokesperson said: 'The body of a man found in the River Trent on April 15, 2015, has been confirmed as that of missing John Lord. 'Mr Lord, 86, went missing from his home in St Ann's on Monday, 6 April. 'His body was recovered at around 11am on April 15 by Nottinghamshire Police's Underwater Search Unit. 'Nottinghamshire Police would like to thank everyone who assisted in the search for Mr Lord by sharing our appeals. 'Mr Lord's family will continue to be supported and have asked for their privacy to be respected. 'The thoughts of Nottinghamshire Police are with the family at this difficult time.' June tragically died on March 31, eight hours after collapsing suddenly from what doctors at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham described as a 'catastrophic bleed' to the brain.

"All eyes will be on AP McCoy as he bids for a dream end to his career but I have a strong feeling that a horse he could have ridden is going to come back to haunt him. The 19-time champion jockey could have ridden Cause of Causes who, like his mount Shutthefrontdoor, is owned by his boss JP McManus. He has ridden him three times before. While it was ultimately no surprise he chose Shutthefrontdoor, a runner with strong credentials, Cause of Causes also has very good reasons why he should be backed. Cause of Causes at Cheltenham last month . He was second at the 2014 Cheltenham Festival and then landed the four-mile National Hunt Chase at last month’s meeting. That marks him down as a quality performer, and he is ridden by a Grand National winning jockey in Paul Carberry (Bobbyjo, 1999) and trained by a race-winning trainer in Gordon Elliott (Silver Birch, 2007). His four mile Cheltenham win indicates reserves of stamina for the four-and-a-half-mile, 30-fence test which I like to see in my Grand National hopes. Shutthefrontdoor, the 2014 Irish National winner, is also strong on that score. I like last year’s runner-up Balthazar King and 2014 Scottish National winner Al Co, as well as Godsmejudge, second in that race having won it in 2013. For those looking for an each-way punt at more speculative odds, Royale Knight is a horse which has caught my eye. I will be cheering on my two sons. Tom rides Soll, another runner with a serious chance of a light weight, while Michael trains Monbeg Dude, last year’s seventh owned by a trio of rugby players including former England captain Mike Tindall. He could easily nick a place."
"Some tour guides will do anything for a good tip. In the Australian outback, if you want to get up-close and personal with a mob of local Emus, you need a guide who will get down and dirty ... apparently. In a video posted online by YouTube user Ratbag Nomad, one man, referred to as Australianwidefishingguide, shows tourists how it's done. Emus are notoriously curious flightless birds of Australia . As the tour guide started peddling his legs slowly in the air, the mob of emus started coming closer . And closer . The video, filmed from a vehicle on an empty dirt road in the bush, shows the guide lying down on his back and kicking his legs in the air to lure a mob of emus in the distance. Peddling his legs to the sky, he looks like something between  an up-side down bicycle rider and a dead cockroach. Sure enough, the Emus - known to be especially curious birds - come close to see what's going on, then scatter as the guide leaps to his feat. A good leg in the air does the trick . As the guide leapt to his feet, the inquisitive birds scattered . It's thought to be an old Aboriginal trick to catch an emu - whose meat was highly valued for its oils. Emus belong to the same family of flightless birds as the ostrich and the cassowary. Capable of reaching running speeds of up to 70 km/hour, they're said to be able to 'run the pants off a Kangaroo.' The manoeuvre is thought to be an old Aboriginal trick to catch an emu - a bird whose meat was highly valued for its oils but who are too fast to catch on foot ."
"The hacking scheme he ran from 2008 to 2014 targeted US pizza chains in Washington state.
The jury in the trial found him guilty on 38 out of 40 charges including fraud and ID theft.
Seleznev, who is the son of a Russian MP, will be sentenced on 2 December and faces a mandatory jail term of four years.
Prosecutors called Seleznev ""one of the most prolific credit card thieves in history"" who stole and sold almost 3 million credit card numbers.
To carry out the hacking scheme, Seleznev hacked into point-of-sale systems in pizza restaurants and then installed malware that siphoned off copies of credit card numbers. The lists of numbers were then sold on net markets where stolen information is traded. More than 3,700 businesses were hit by the hack attacks, said prosecutors.
Seleznev pleaded not guilty.
US Secret Service agents arrested Seleznev and his girlfriend at a Maldives airport in 2014.
Lawyers acting for the hacker said they planned to appeal against the conviction. The appeal will seek to challenge what his legal team described as his ""illegal arrest"" in 2014 as well as a separate ruling that let the government use evidence from a corrupted laptop seized when he was arrested.
""If Roman was Canadian, this case would never have happened,"" Seleznev's lawyer John Henry Browne told the Wall Street Journal. ""There was definitely politics involved in this.""
Russia has also lodged official complaints about Seleznev's seizure and extradition saying it pointed to a campaign by US authorities to ""hunt"" Russians all over the world.
The US Department of Justice said Seleznev ""was prosecuted for his conduct not his nationality""."
"The barrister turned politician led the Home Office at the time of the poll tax riots and the Strangeways prison disturbances in the spring of 1990.
On the right of the party, he entered Parliament in a by-election in the 1960s and served as chief whip and other roles under Margaret Thatcher.
After leaving the House of Commons, he served as leader of the House of Lords and latterly as governor of Bermuda.
Prime Minister Theresa May paid tribute to Lord Waddington's ""long and distinguished career in public service"", saying he would be sadly missed.
""He combined the sharp intelligence of a Queen's Counsel with the wit of a proud Lancastrian,"" she said.

After rising through the ministerial ranks, he became chief whip - in charge of party discipline - before succeeding Lord Hurd as home secretary in October 1989.
A supporter of capital punishment, he took a tougher line on law and order issues than his predecessor, piloting legislation through the Commons in 1990 to ensure serious criminals served longer sentences.

"Cardinals held prayers and swore oaths of secrecy at their first meeting, held by the College of Cardinals.
There will be a series of daily meetings leading up to a conclave, expected to begin next week, in which a new Pope will be chosen.
The election process comes after Pope Benedict XVI stepped down last week.
He was the first pontiff to resign in 600 years, after nearly eight years in office leading the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics.
The first pre-conclave meeting on Monday morning was headed by the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Angelo Sodano.
The Vatican said 101 of the 115 cardinals involved in the conclave have arrived in Rome. A further 12 are due to arrive either today or tomorrow, while two are not attending.
They are the UK's Cardinal Keith O'Brien, who is standing down amid allegations of improper behaviour, and Indonesia's Julius Darmaatmadja, who is ill.
At the pre-conclave meetings, cardinals - known as the ""princes"" of the Church - will discuss future challenges and discreetly weigh up possible papal candidates.
The conclave - to be held in the Sistine Chapel - is expected to take place next week, though the exact date will be agreed on in the coming days.
Correspondents say the cardinal electors, those under the age of 80 who will take part in the conclave, will want the new Pope to be officially installed in time to preside over Holy Week.
Ceremonies start with Palm Sunday on 24 March and culminate in Easter the following Sunday.
Last year's ""Vatileaks"" scandal is expected to be high on the agenda during the meetings.
Corruption and infighting in the Vatican were exposed through a series of leaked documents, and the cardinals are expected this week to be briefed on a confidential report into the scandal seen by Pope Benedict.
The BBC's David Willey in Rome says strict precautions against leaks of unauthorised information will be in operation at the Vatican until the next Pope has been chosen.
Technicians will debug the cardinals' lodgings and mobile phones will be banned altogether during the conclave.
But some cardinals have suggested the internal workings and possible failings of the Vatican's bureaucracy will not be a major factor in the decision to elect the next pope.
""I think the real priority in the conclave is to choose the pope who is going to deal with these great, global issues,"" said Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington, speaking to the Associated Press in Rome, before the meetings began.
""If there are some internal problems in the Vatican, administrative problems in the Vatican, that'll eventually be dealt with. But it certainly isn't going to condition how I am going to be looking at who is going to guide and lead the church in the next years.""
The church's handling of allegations of sexual abuse is another recurring issue.
Cardinal Keith O'Brien, formerly Britain's former most senior Roman Catholic cleric, has said he will not take part in the conclave after standing down amid allegations of improper behaviour.
On Sunday, he admitted his sexual conduct had at times ""fallen beneath the standards expected of me"".
He apologised and asked forgiveness from those whom he had ""offended"".
Cardinal O'Brien resigned as Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh last Monday after three priests and a former priest made allegations against him dating back to the 1980s.
Benedict, 85, officially ceased to be the Pope at 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Thursday.
He left the Vatican by helicopter, flying to the papal retreat at Castel Gandolfo, near Rome.
He has vowed ""unconditional obedience and reverence"" to his successor.
The German pontiff, who was born Joseph Ratzinger, will continue to be known as Benedict XVI, with the new title of ""pope emeritus"".
The theologian is expected to retire to a monastery on a hill inside Vatican City. Officials say he will not be able to intervene publicly in the next papacy although he may offer advice."
"Crispr-Cas9 replaces harmful DNA with new code that kills cancerous cells while leaving healthy ones unharmed.
Mice with the reprogrammed code developed tumours that were much smaller than cancers in mice that did not get this treatment.
Experts call the study, in Nature Methods, promising but say it is unclear yet whether the technique would work in humans.
Dr Weiren Huang, from the First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, in China, and colleagues used Crispr-Cas9 to reprogram a cell-signalling pathway that would normally feed tumour growth in mice.
How gene editing works
Gene editing: A game-changer
Crispr-Cas9 is a DNA cutting and pasting system scientists have borrowed from nature.
Bacteria use it to protect themselves against foreign DNA from viruses.
Scientists have already begun using it in the lab to target and cut out faulty DNA in human cells that cause illnesses.
But it is not without risks.
While effective, the editing process is less than perfect and can cut out too much DNA.
These unwanted or ""off-target"" edits could alter other important genes, inadvertently triggering cancer, for example.
Dr Chris Lord, a gene expert at the Institute of Cancer Research, said: """"The key to translating this technique into the clinic will be to see how specific to the tumour cell the Crispr activation will be and how specific, in terms of genes, the Crispr-mediated gene cutting will be.
""These are essentially the same two issues you have with all cancer treatments - how specific for the tumour cell and how specific for the target."""
"The pups came from as far away as New Jersey and Tennessee in hopes of landing a new nickname: 'Beautiful Bulldog.' They were all defeated by a native who likes eating snow and watching turtles. A 2-year-old dog from Des Moines named Tank won the 36th annual Beautiful Bulldog contest Sunday at Drake University. Scroll down for video . Winner: Tank, a 2-year-old bulldog from Iowa won Drake University's 36th annual 'Beautiful Bulldog' contest Sunday . A real beauty: Tank, who enjoys eating snow and watching turtles, will now serve as mascot of this year's Drake Relays . Tank received top honors as well as a crown and cape. He will appear before more than 16,000 fans -- or, royal subjects -- at the university's Drake Relays to be honored as mascot of the event, which will be held from Thursday through Saturday, according to the contest's website. The tongue-in-cheek beauty pageant, which featured 50 dogs, is the kickoff event for the Drake Relays track meet. 'He's funny,' said Tank's owner, Duane Smith. 'He's a real good one.' Pageant organizers narrowed a pool of more than 100 hopeful pups by a lottery held last month. Owner: Here, Tank enjoys a rub from his owner, Duane Smith, after winning the 36th annual contest . Judges weren't looking for beauty though. They wanted to see the slobber, drool and bulging, bloodshot eyes synonymous with English bulldogs. They got all that and more from Tank — who now willingly shares his house with a Pomeranian and some turtles after Smith found him on Craigslist a year ago. Should Tank be unable to fulfill his duties as the Drake Relays mascot, fellow Des Moines pup Steve will step in. Steve was second even though he was initially so shy about the makeshift catwalk set up on Drake's basketball court that his owner had to pick him up and plunk him down, much to the delight of the few thousand spectators on hand.

If there was an award for driving the furthest to enter the contest it would've gone to Ronnie Sussman and her dog Bex, who drove 17 hours from Union, New Jersey. Sussman and Bex will go home empty-handed, but she said the trip was more than worth it. 'This is just like a bucket list item of life for me,' Sussman said."
"Paul Gambaccini blamed the presenters' obsession with discussing the sex appeal of pop stars for a slump in ratings . It has been a staple of Sunday night listening for almost 50 years – but now Radio 1's Chart Show has been branded a 'banal failure' by one of the most respected voices in broadcasting. Veteran presenter Paul Gambaccini has blasted the BBC for destroying the Top 40 show by employing 'ignorant' DJs who are more interested in giving vacuous opinions than playing the records. Gambaccini, a respected rock historian, blamed the presenters' obsession with discussing the sex appeal of pop stars for a slump in ratings. The 66-year-old said: 'It is no wonder the Chart Show is a complete failure because it has not accomplished what it was set out to be. It is the news of popular music and, if it is to have any integrity, it should be an objective show. You wouldn't expect Huw Edwards to give his opinion on the news he is reading or to suddenly say 'Isn't Hillary Clinton fit?' The Chart Show has become an extension of its presenter's personality rather than an objective programme.' Gambaccini, a former Radio 1 DJ himself, said he was particularly annoyed about last week's show when host Clara Amfo appeared to dismiss superstar Paul Simon, who had just topped the album charts at the age of 73. The 29-year-old made a passing reference to the star's No 1 album, The Ultimate Collection, before telling listeners to 'ask your dad'. Gambaccini said: 'To me that is an ignorant attitude. You don't disrespect the No 1 album, regardless of who it's by. 'What is the point of saying this is the Top 5 and not playing any of them? That is really stupid. No 1 is No 1. If you don't wish to be authoritative any more you might as well stop. Don't pretend you are important when you are not.' 'Paul Simon has just sold out the O2 with Sting. We are talking about a current major figure in popular music. These are people who will be enjoyed long after our lifetimes as we know and enjoy Beethoven.' The Chart Show has had a presence on Sunday nights in one form or another since the days of Alan 'Fluff' Freeman when Radio 1 launched in 1967. The current version has seen its audience dwindle from a peak of four million in the early 1980s to about 1.2 million. It will end in July, when the chart rundown will become part of Greg James's Friday drivetime show, to reflect changes in the music industry. Gambaccini, who recently returned to Radio 2 after being cleared over historic sex abuse claims, said: 'I wish Greg James well but it will never have the impact being a feature of his programme that it had on a Sunday.' The BBC said: 'The Chart Show is an entertainment programme and as such our DJs present the countdown in a way that is engaging and relevant to our young audience.' In February, Radio 1 was at the centre of another ageism storm after The Mail on Sunday revealed Madonna had been dropped from the playlist. Gambaccini, a former Radio 1 DJ himself, said he was particularly annoyed about last week's show when host Clara Amfo (pictured) appeared to dismiss superstar Paul Simon ."
"Patients are being put at risk because paramedics are leaving firemen to deal with 999 calls, healthcare leaders warn. Many firemen have not been trained in basic first aid – yet they are being left to care for seriously ill elderly patients for hours while they wait for an ambulance. The Fire Brigades Union say the practice is irresponsible and dangerous but is becoming increasingly common because the ambulance service is so overstretched. The ambulance service is becoming increasingly reliant on firemen to attend life-threatening emergencies . The Fire Brigade Union say the practice is irresponsible and dangerous and becoming more common . Senior union officials say fire engines are routinely being turned into makeshift ambulances to ferry patients to A&E. They normally carry a few blankets, oxygen masks to protect against smokes and a defibrillator – to restart the heart. In one case earlier this year an elderly lady is feared to have died because she was left in the hands of fire crews for nearly 40 minutes while paramedics were delayed. The ambulance service is facing unprecedented demand from the rising and aging population and in some areas 999 calls are up by 15 per cent on last year. Paramedics are also having to respond to rising numbers of non-urgent calls from patients frustrated that they cannot get an appointment with their GP. They are also having to waste much of their time queued up outside A&E units which cannot accept their patients because staff there are also very busy. This has all led to the ambulance service increasingly relying on firemen to attend potentially life-threatening emergencies. The Fire Brigades Union yesterday warned that South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue were sending firemen with no medical training to 999 calls instead of ambulances. It pointed out that only a third of firefighters at this branch had any medical training – and even this only consisted of a four day course of basic first aid. Yet in one case they were left to help an elderly lady who had stopped breathing for 45 minutes whilst they waited for the ambulance to arrive. Senior union officials say fire engines are routinely being turned into makeshift ambulances to ferry patients to A&E . In another, they tended to a pensioner who had fallen and banged her head for two hours before they were forced to leave her on her own – to attend a fire. The practice is occurring across the country and last July, firemen took a 16-year-old girl with suspected bleeding on the brain to A&E in Warrington, Cheshire . In December, crews were sent to a care home in Ryde on the Isle of Wight where an elderly woman had a stroke and were ordered to cut the rings off her fingers which were turning blue because of poor blood flow. Ian Murray, vice-president of the Fire Brigades Union – which represents 44,000 firemen – said: 'We know only a small percentage of firefighters are trained to give basic first aid. 'It is irresponsible and dangerous to put untrained firefighters in the position of attending incidents to assist the ambulance service, with the knowledge that it is highly unlikely one will arrive for some considerable time.' In January, a woman of 84 from Doncaster is feared to have died because firemen were sent to her home rather than an ambulance. Paramedics did not show up for 40 minutes after which time her pulse had stopped. Last month the Mail revealed how London Ambulance Service had resorted to flying half way round the world to Australia to hire 225 paramedics because it is so overstretched."
"It may look like a misshapen disk of metal, but this coin is one of the oldest ever to be found in Britain. The tiny copper coin, which is smaller than a penny, dates from the Iron Age almost 2,300 years ago and suggests there were links between the south west of England and the Mediterranean. It was found in silt after the River Avon burst its banks between Bristol and Bath. The tiny copper coin, which is smaller than a penny, dates from the Iron Age almost 2,300 years ago and suggests there were links between the south west of England and the Mediterranean . On one side there is a horse’s head, while the other bears the image of the goddess Tanit, the chief deity of Carthage. Experts have dated the coin to between 300 BC and 264 BC and say it came from the Western Mediterranean - probably Sardinia or ancient Carthage. The find suggests that the village of Saltford, where it was found, was on a major trade route long before Roman times. On one side of the coin there the image of the Goddess Tanit, the chief deity of Carthage, (pictured left) while on the reverse is a horse’s head, pictured right . The find suggests that the village of Saltford (shown on the map with a red marker), where the coin was found, was on a major trade route long before Roman times . It is believed there was a ford in the area, which made it the only place to cross the river Avon at the time. One side of the coin shows an image of the Carthaginian goddess Tanit,  suggesting links between the south west and the Mediterranean . The coin is thought to be the oldest dateable evidence of human activity found in Saltford and the West of England. It suggests Iron Age links between the Mediterranean and the Bristol Channel, which the River Avon flows into around 15 miles (24km) away. Professor David Mattingly, an archaeologist and Roman historian at the University of Leicester said: ‘It’s really interesting to have a Carthaginian coin in Britain. ‘Suppose that coin was deposited close to its minting - at the time, there were no coins being used in Britain. It would have been quite alien to people. ‘We are very sure that horses were important at the time so that may have invoked a lot of interest back then. It’s a very interesting find.’ Phil Harding of the Saltford Environment Group, said that the coin’s significant because it is one of the oldest coins ever to be found in England. ‘Only eight of these have ever been found, always on ancient trade routes,’ he said. ‘We can’t believe it. We thought we would be writing the history of Saltford from the Roman times to now. ‘But now we have to go back to the Iron Age. It’s absolutely fantastic.’ Last July a hoard of Roman and Late Iron Age coins were found in a cave in Dovedale in the Peak District, where they had lain undisturbed for 2,000 years. It was the first time that coins from the two separated groups have been found buried together. Archaeologists discovered 26 coins, including three Roman coins which pre-date the invasion of Britain in 43 AD, and 20 other gold and silver pieces which are Late Iron Age and thought to belong to the Corieltavi tribe. Last July a hoard of Roman and Late Iron Age coins (pictured) were found in a cave in Dovedale in the Peak District, where they had lain undisturbed for 2,000 years . National Trust archaeologist Rachael Hall said whoever owned the cache was probably a wealthy and influential figure. 'The coins would suggest a serious amount of wealth and power of the individual who owned them. ‘Coins were used more as a symbol of power and status during the Late Iron Age, rather than for buying and selling staple foods and supplies. ‘...The situation of the cave can’t be ignored either. Could it have been a sacred place to the Late Iron Age peoples that was taboo to enter in everyday life, making it a safe place that would ensure that person’s valuables were protected?'"
"The 23-year-old batsman has set himself two goals; scoring 1,000 first-class runs for the first time in his career and breaking into the county's one-day team.
Wells came close to his first target last season, when he scored 982 Championship runs at an average of 37.76, but he is eager to keep improving.
""I expect a lot from myself because I believe I am a good enough player to deliver bigger and better results,"" he told BBC Sport.
""Although I have done reasonably well over the last three years I don't feel I have done as well as I could have or should have done.
Statistics correct at 31 May
""I feel my average isn't as high as it should be and that I should have hit 1,000 runs by now.
""You'd rather be expecting more than be satisfied with average results. Moving forward you always have to have the will to improve and exceed expectations.
""I don't put pressure on myself. I just see it as a challenge.""
The left-hander believes he should have reached the 1,000-run milestone in 2013.
""If I didn't give away a couple of innings I would have got there,"" he said.
""I spent my winter in Sydney and definitely improved. I feel I've opened up a few areas through the offside I may not have had previously and am targeting about 1,100 or 1,200 runs.
""The only difference is when you are in and on 40, that you give it away. If you convert those into slightly higher scores, when then there is no reason why you should get out, then I will be at 1,200 runs.
""I feel I am a better player now and I have the mental concentration and the defensive technique to do it.""
Ahead of the current match against Nottinghamshire at Hove, Wells had scored 221 runs in his five Championship appearances this season - with his high score of 79 not out coming against Somerset in April.
He admits he is ""a fair way"" off his target but is keen to contribute to Sussex's title challenge, with the Hove side currently fifth in the Division One table.
I am targeting about 1,100 or 1,200 runs. I feel I am a better player now and I have the mental concentration and the defensive technique to do it
""I feel in really good nick at the moment and that there's a big three-figure score just around the corner,"" he said.
""I know if I keep doing the same things and backing myself I'll score a good amount of runs.
""It may sound cliched but if I get a thousand runs and we win the title then brilliant. If I get 900 and we win the title I'll take that. As long as the runs I'm scoring are contributing to winning efforts that is most important.
""We have got a strong squad and one hallmark of this season so far is competition for batting spaces. Everyone is under pressure as you know you need to get your runs.
""That is the way it should be in any squad. You shouldn't be able to rest on your laurels as people around you want to take your spot.""
The former England Under-19 international, who is the son of former Sussex captain and one-time England Test player Alan, believes his time in Australia has improved his all-round game.
""I had a clear basic goal which was to work on a couple of technical areas to do with my trigger and my stance to be in a better position so that I can move more freely and make me more dynamic at the crease,"" he said.
""I feel I am a lot quicker on my feet, which will help in all formats of my game. I've worked on shots through the off-side, my one-day skills in general and my fitness.""
Wells, meanwhile, describes his efforts to break into Sussex's one-day side as ""difficult and frustrating"".
The Eastbourne-born player has only made one competitive Twenty20 appearance for the club, coming against Glamorgan in 2011, and has made just a handful of appearances in List A competition.
Sussex have performed strongly in both Twenty20 and 40-over competition in recent years, but made group-stage exits in both formats in 2013.
Wells says the county calendar has not helped his cause but hopes the new schedule, which sees the T20 Blast played throughout the season and the new 50-over One Day Cup played in July and August, could benefit him.
""So far in my career I've started well in four-day competition then T20 comes along, I have a big break in the middle of my season and I try to find a way to keep the momentum going,"" he said.
""It has been quite hard work. I think this year with the Friday nights will help.
""I've been pushing as hard as I can and have been working a lot on my one-day skills. I can strike a ball as far as anyone in the squad.
""It is just about putting it all together into performances in the middle.
""It is hard with the schedule in and around four-day cricket to find time to play second XI T20 games.
""You need your currency, as it were, to show the coaches that you can do it.""
Wells did play five CB40 matches for Sussex last season but only managed to make seven runs in four innings.
""Unfortunately last year I did get a run at the top of the order but I got out,"" he said.
""They were classic dismissals - a caught behind and a couple of lbws - but that's the way it goes. That is suddenly four games and you haven't scored a run.
""I feel I am in a good place with my game and am offering other skills, not just with my batting. I am determined to get in the side.
""Every year we always push quite hard in one-day competitions and have had quite a lot of success. Last year we didn't have that and I was disappointed to not get a go in a T20 game come the end of the campaign.
""Having said that the team needed its momentum and wanted to go with the same guys, which is absolutely understandable.
""All I can do is put myself in the best possible position that when I do get a chance, to take it."""
"Tyler Walker is a player who could form Nottingham Forest’s attack for years to come, according to manager Dougie Freedman. The 18-year-old striker came off the bench to score an impressive first goal of his senior career at Brentford on East Monday. It took him level with a Forest legend of the same surname: his dad Des, a scorer just once in 408 games for the club. Tyler Walker celebrates after scoring his first senior goal for Nottingham Forest away to Brentford . A source of mirth around the dinner table? Quite probably, although the younger Walker still has some way to go to match his father’s feats. He has managed just 56 minutes in his fledgling career so far, a distance from the 858 senior games, including 59 England caps, of Des. Still, the game is about goals… . True, and Walker Junior’s was a peach, controlling a high ball in an instant, shimmying past a defender, and rifling a left-foot shot into the net. It was curiously similar to his old man’s only goal, coming on New Year’s Day 1992 against Luton. He too smashed in an angled shot with his left. The younger Walker could already have passed his tally had he done better than skew wide a glorious chance at Griffin Park. The 18-year-old attacker is son of former England and Nottingham Forest defender Des Walker . He seems the real deal though, not just daddy’s boy made good through connections? That paternal link may have helped initially but since entering the Forest academy Tyler has proved his pedigree. He began the season in Jack Lester's Under-18 squad, and made a sizeable impression in January by firing a hat-trick against West Bromwich Albion in the FA Youth Cup fourth round. He progressed to Forest’s Under-21s and scored seven goals in 13 starts, leading Freedman to take notice and offer a chance following injuries to Britt Assombalonga, Matty Fryatt and Dexter Blackstock. Walker made his debut in the final minute of Forest’s 2-0 win over Rotherham on March 18, at the same age his dad did under Brian Clough 31 years earlier. Walker scored a goal of the highest quality as he twisted and turned before firing past David Button . Freedman presumably knows a good striker when he finds one… . The Forest manager is a huge fan of the teenager, hyping him up rather than playing things down. ‘I believe he can play for the club for a very long time and make the striker's role his in the very near future,’ Freedman said after the draw against Brentford. ‘I am pleased to stand here and say, “You have a wonderful young asset at the football club who is only going to get better”. ‘The biggest advantage is that he is a very well-rounded, level-headed boy that turns up every day and works hard. If he has that mindset then you have a chance.’ What are his attributes? As displayed by his goal, Walker is two-footed and possesses good balance. He is quick, an intelligent runner, and a smart finisher. He also has a striker’s mentality. As part of the FA Youth Cup hat-trick he won an argument with team-mate Gerry McDonagh over who would take a penalty, going on to score. The youngest is highly thought of by Forest boss Dougie Freedman, who believes he has a big future ."
"Arsene Wenger has challenged his squad to put any dreams of a late charge for the Barclays Premier League to bed and focus instead on the cold reality of winning at Burnley on Saturday. Arsenal head to Turf Moor in search of what would be an eighth straight league victory, following on from last weekend's 4-1 triumph over Liverpool. Despite their superb run, which has seen confidence grow after some 15 wins in the last 17 through all competitions, the title remains Chelsea's to lose, as the leaders currently hold a seven-point advantage and also a match in hand. Nacho Monreal, Theo Walcott, Hector Bellerin and Olivier Giroud appear in good spirits during training . Mesut Ozil shares a joke with Monreal at Arsenal's training HQ while Alexis Sanchez has his shorts rolled up . Santi Cazorla is set to make his 100th Premier League appearance while Abou Diaby is back from injury . While some Gunners fans may have allowed themselves a little bit of fantasy football results over the run-in, which will see Chelsea come to the Emirates Stadium on April 26 and also play both Manchester United and Liverpool, Wenger remains very much focused on the job in hand. 'I have enough experience to know that I have to live with reality and reality is points and the next game,' he said. 'The dreams are for everybody - we all have dreams at night, but when I wake up in the morning I have to come here and make sure we give everything to win the next game.' Wenger continued: 'Chelsea have a difficult schedule, we have a difficult schedule, but what we can only do is master our own schedule. 'What we want is to go as high as we can until the end of the season, give our best and we are also in the semi-final of the FA Cup. 'So we are at an important moment of the Premier League season and it is a period where you show your quality by focusing on the next game and maintain the quality. 'Of course we want to continue to progress and improve - we can learn from victory as well and everything was not perfect in our last game.' Mathieu Flamini, Ozil and Sanchez are pictured at Arsenal's London Colney base on Friday . Laurent Koscielny is put through his paces on Friday as he bids to return to full fitness . Jack Wilshere hasn't played since November but is in line to feature at Burnley on Saturday evening . Arsenal's injury problems look to have finally eased, with midfielders Mikel Arteta, Jack Wilshere and Abou Diaby all having stepped up their rehabilitation from injury, along with full-back Mathieu Debuchy. England international Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, though, continues to be hampered by an inflamed groin, while centre-half Laurent Koscielny will face a fitness test on his thigh problem ahead of Saturday's match. Burnley continue to scrap at the other end of the table, currently second bottom, but only two points from safety. With Manchester City having gone down 1-0 at Turf Moor last month and Tottenham then held to a goalless draw, Wenger is not taking the trip to Lancashire lightly. He said: 'You shouldn't look at the table because they started slowly, but recently they have played very well against all the big teams in the league and are quite efficient at home. 'You have to be at their level of physical performance, because they will be there. 'On the rest, you want to produce the quality of performance that is expected from us on the technical side, but you have first to fight with them physically, that's for sure. 'We have to make sure we produce the expected performance on the commitment, on the focus and on the quality of our game.'"
"Police have launched a manhunt for a father suspected of gunning down his girlfriend while she was driving. Andrew 'Drew' Butler, 25, allegedly shot mother-of-three Kendra Gonzalez from the passenger seat in San Jose, California, in front of the couple's two-year-old son and her teenage daughter. Police said Gonzalez and Butler were involved in an argument when the gun went off. Manhunt: Andrew 'Drew' Butler, 25, allegedly shot mother-of-three Kendra Gonzalez from the passenger seat in San Jose, California, in front of the couple's two-year-old son and her two teenage daughters . After the vehicle stopped, Butler got out and  dragged her body from the driver’s seat and left it on the road. According to KPIX he then ordered the teenage daughter, who was with her boyfriend at the time to get out of the car and take the baby with them, before driving off. Family members said the eldest daughter was screaming, saying: 'Don't kill my mom.' They have since set up a GoFundMe page called: 'In loving memory of Kendra Gonzalez'. The page said: 'Kendra was brutally shot & murdered in front of her two children on April 7, 2015 by her boyfriend. We are raising money for her burial services and also for her children. 'Any amount of money you can donate will be very much appreciated. Unfortunately she did not have life insurance so we need to raise as much money as possible. 'She left behind three beautiful children and a host of family and friends.' Nearly $5,000 has been raised so far. Tribute: Family and friends lay flowers at the victim's home and have since set up a GoFundMe page to help raise money for her family ."
"A 90-year-old grandmother will not receive the $41million jackpot she thought she won at an Iowa slot machine after the state supreme court ruled her wining pull was caused by a software error. Pauline McKee thought she hit it big in 2011 when, after putting a penny in the 'Miss Kitty' game at the Isle Hotel Casino in Waterloo, the screen announced she had won a bonus award of $41,797,550.16. But on Friday the Iowa Supreme Court determined McKee, who has thirteen grandchildren, had actually only won $1.85 because of how the symbols had aligned in the game. The unanimous court ruled that the casino did not have to pay McKee because the game's rules stated that the maximum award was $10,000 and that bonus awards were not allowed. Pauline McKee, 90, will not receive the $41million jackpot she thought she won from the slots at the Isle Hotel Casino (pictured) in Waterloo, Iowa after the state supreme court ruled her win came from a software error . 'I had my doubts from the start, because that's a lot of money for a penny machine,' McKee told the Chicago Tribune after the ruling. 'I was hoping to help my children out financially, but it wasn't meant to be.' Justice Edward Mansfield wrote that the game's rules and pay table, which are available for reading on the machine, amount to a contract between the casino and the player. The contract is binding, whether or not the player reads the rules, he said. 'Any message appearing on the screen indicating the patron would receive a $41million bonus was a gratuitous promise,' Mansfield wrote in a ruling that dismissed McKee's lawsuit. 'The casino's failure to pay it could not be challenged as a breach of contract.' Stacey Cormican, one of the casino's attorneys, said the court's decision will ensure fairness in Iowa's large gambling industry. 'Casinos are required to post rules and follow those rules. If either the patrons or casinos could change the rules in the middle of the game, it would be absolutely chaos,' she said. Cormican said the casino could have been forced into bankruptcy if the court had ruled in McKee's favor. A $41 million payout would amount to about half of the gross revenue the casino generated last year. McKee, a widow, was playing the penny slots with her daughter during a family reunion when she thought she won the life-changing bonus. Casino officials investigated the machine after she informed an attendant that she had won the jackpot. The unanimous court ruled that the casino did not have to pay McKee because the rules of the 'Miss Kitty' game (pictured) stated that the maximum award was $10,000 and did not allow for bonus awards . The machine was reviewed by the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission and it's hardware and software was analyzed in a laboratory, which discovered the erroneous bonus message. In 2010 Aristocrat Technologies Inc., the game's manufacturer, also warned casinos that the machine's hardware was susceptible to displaying 'legacy bonus' awards that had not actually been won. A sign on the casino's game read that 'malfunction voids all pays and plays'. The casino gave McKee a $10 card to play while she waited during the initial investigation and eventually paid for her family's rooms. McKee sued the casino in 2012 after the commission determined the casino didn't have to pay-out because of the machine's glitch. Her lawyers argued that the casino had an implied contract with the customers to pay whatever number they were awarded on the slot machine, according to the Chicago Tribune. Judge Mansfield found the argument to be 'contrary to precedent and general contract principles,' he wrote. As for McKee, she said she will not be playing the slots at Isle Hotel anytime soon. 'They didn't give me anything except what I had on the machine,' she said. 'If they're not going to give me any money at all, that's terrible.'"
"TESTOSTERONE . by Joe Herbert . (OUP £16.99) Testosterone doesn’t always get a good press. Everything that’s unpleasant about male behaviour has been ascribed to the effects of this much maligned hormone. Violence? It’s all testosterone’s fault. Sexual assault and rape? Just blame testosterone. Yet, as Joe Herbert makes clear in his engaging whistlestop tour of the science surrounding it, testosterone is at the heart of human life. ‘Without our father’s testosterone,’ as he writes, ‘none of us would exist.’ It has only one basic function — to enable a male to reproduce, and for that it’s essential. Although this is the case and it’s impossible to think of ‘maleness’ without testosterone, it’s also important for sexual behaviour in women. The blood of an adult woman before menopause actually contains about five times more testosterone than oestrogen, the supposedly ‘female’ hormone. However, it’s as a metaphor for masculinity that testosterone is best known. All that’s unpleasant about male behaviour is ascribed to testosterone, yet as Joe Herbert explains, testosterone is at the heart of human life . It begins its influence in the womb as it helps to shape the distinctive characteristics of the male body. This influence continues immediately after birth. That three-month-old baby boy, sweetly smiling at you from his pram, may well have testosterone levels that rival his father’s. We don’t know why but, starting two weeks after birth and lasting for four to six months, a little boy’s testes are producing testosterone in substantial amounts. The hormone’s power then recedes, but returns — and how! — in puberty. Post-puberty, testosterone drives the competition for females. In the animal world, stags lock antlers, elephants enter the aggressive state known as musth and male rhinos go horn-to-horn. Even male giraffes, aroused by the hormone’s influence, flail at one another with their long necks. Elaborate colourings emerge in some species, designed to emphasise masculinity and attract female attention. In guenon monkeys the scrotum turns bright blue. They don’t seem to mind. They adopt the habit of sitting with their legs apart to show the female guenons just how big and blue they are. We can only be thankful that testosterone’s effects on sexual display in humans are not so visually dramatic. Adult human males have varying levels of the hormone in different circumstances. Entirely unsurprisingly, having sex increases testosterone levels. So, too, does talking to an attractive woman and watching pornographic movies. Winning at sports sends the levels racing upwards. Just supporting a winning team can have the same effect. It works in politics as well. A study showed that, during the 2008 U.S. Presidential election, Barack Obama supporters were pumped full of testosterone. Levels fell in the supporters of his defeated rival, John McCain. Testosterone also helps in the City. Another study, on a London trading floor, showed that male traders made more money on days on which their morning testosterone levels were higher than usual. A challenge is obviously stimulating. Surgeons facing difficult procedures often find their testosterone levels shooting up. One would assume that the theatre of war would have the same effect as the operating theatre, if not more so. After all, testosterone is supposed to be the hormone behind violence and aggression. In fact, soldiers in the heat of battle can have testosterone levels not much above those of men who have been castrated. It’s the appalling stress that reduces it. Once they leave the front line, however, the soldiers revert to more normal levels. When levels are high, the effects of testosterone on male behaviour are so strong that the human brain has had to find a multitude of ways of regulating and channelling them. The creation of laws, religion and customs has, to some extent, been shaped by the need to do so. In that sense, as Joe Herbert writes, ‘testosterone lies at the heart of much of our history’. His own fascination with the ‘simple but wondrous chemical’ that is his subject is clear. His book does a fine job of conveying that fascination to the rest of us."
"From 20 March, speed restrictions and speed cameras will be introduced where work is taking place.
The upgrade work will see the six-mile ""missing link"" completed on the M8 in North Lanarkshire.
Improvements to the Raith Interchange and widening of key sections of the M8, M73 and M74 are also taking place.
The work will see upgrading of the M8 between Baillieston and Newhouse to motorway standard.
This will require upgrades to the connections to the M73 motorway at Baillieston and a new junction at Shawhead, which will connect to the A725 East Kilbride road.
There will also be new junctions at Eurocentral and Chapelhall.
Improvements to the Raith Interchange near Hamilton in Lanarkshire include realignment of the A725.
There will be an underpass for the A725 and bridges carrying the Raith roundabout.
The improvements are expected to cut journey times by up to 18 minutes for the busiest sections of the M8.
Graeme Reid, project sponsor for Transport Scotland, said: ""We have reached a pivotal point in this three year project, involving traffic management measures which are likely to cause some disruption to road users, especially at peak times.
""The biggest challenge on a project of this scale is to keep the 100,000 vehicles that use these key routes every day moving and to ensure disruption to road users is minimised as far as is practically possible.""
He added: ""The installation of safety cameras is a tried and tested mechanism that improves safety for both road users and the workforce during what will be an extremely busy period in terms of construction.""
The first traffic restrictions and safety cameras will be brought in along the M74 northbound and southbound from J6 Hamilton to J3A Daldowie.
Three narrow lanes will be in operation to allow the construction of a new lane and hard shoulder.
Improvements at the Raith Interchange will see speed restrictions and temporary lane closures and diversions to allow excavation works to start on the construction of the A725 underpass below the existing roundabout.
The new underpass will link the Bellshill Bypass and the East Kilbride Expressway (A725) and create a new route for traffic, cutting out the heavily-congested Raith Junction.
Two lanes will remain operational in each direction across all roads during peak times, although traffic management and speed restrictions will be in place."
"Kim Sei-young will take a three-shot lead into the final round of the ANA Inspiration after carding a three-under-par 69 in California on Saturday. The South Korean, who led by two shots at the halfway stage at Mission Hills Country Club, birdied the first hole before a bogey at the par-three fifth halted her progress. Kim returned to one-under par for the round when she picked up a shot at the par-five ninth, before successive birdies on the 16th and 17th moved her to three under-par for the day and 10 under overall. Kim Sei-Young has established a three-shot lead ahead of the final round of the ANA Inspiration . The South Korean shot a three-under-par round of 69 on day three of the competition . The 22-year-old, who won the Pure Silk-Bahamas Classic in February, is in good spirits as she chases her first LPGA major victory. 'If I were to win it tomorrow, it would be the biggest dream ever to come true for me,' Kim told the LPGA Tour website. 'You know, just because, I've watched this tournament since I was young. 'That's why I feel I want it so much more, and I think the opportunity is there in front of me, and if I can, I definitely want to get my hand on it, and for sure it won't be bad jumping into that pond tomorrow.' American Stacy Lewis is second after she shot a 68 with six birdies and two bogeys to lie seven-under. The 2011 winner is one shot clear of Thailand's Ariya Jutanugarn, who shot a best-of-the-day 66, and American duo Brittany Lincicome and Morgan Pressel. World No 1 Lydia Ko toiled again, shooting her second consecutive over-par score, carding 74 . World No 1 Lydia Ko shot her second consecutive over-par score when she could only manage a two-over-par 74, which included three bogeys and a birdie. The 17-year-old New Zealander equalled Annika Sorenstam's LPGA Tour record with her 29th consecutive under-par round in the first round on Thursday, but could not set a new mark when she could only manage a one-over-par 73 on Friday."
"With her contoured cheeks, flawless glow and smokey eyes, let's face it, who doesn't want to look like Kim Kardashian? When the reality TV star once shared a snap mid-way through her makeover revealing her contouring tricks, a new beauty craze was born. And now, the secret behind the 34-year-old reality TV star's glowing skin has been revealed. Scroll down for video . Want to look like Kim Kardashian? Now you can, because the flawless star has revealed the products that give her that envy-inducing glow . The mother-of-one, who shared her beauty essentials on Instagram, protects her skin with a £65 ($96) Creme de la Mer SPF 30 UV Protecting Fluid, which claims to prevent the appearance of discolorations while providing protection from the sun. The cream, which is packed with gemstones, peculiar sounding 'photonic spheres' and smart seaweeds, can also be used as a make-up primer. Kim shared her beauty essentials on her Instagram page and, of course, a hairbrush from her own brand featured . Kim then loves to spritz her face with a £12 ($18) rose water mist from Glossier. The little-known product is made with roses and aloe and aims to to hydrate, soothe, and leave you feeling fresh and awake. The brand say the product is also 'excellent as a make-up refresher and midday pick-me-up'. To remove the day's face, Kim uses a NARS face wash and Black Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System. The NARS Gentle Cream Cleanser apparently helps to maintain skin's moisture balance while removing makeup and impurities. Meanwhile, the vibrating brush uses a micro-massage motion, which is said to work within skin's natural elasticity to gently remove the impurities traditional methods leave behind-leaving skin softer, smoother and more beautiful. Clearly it's working for Kim. Other beauty essentials in her cosmetics bag include a hairbrush from her own range, Kardashian Beauty, which she established with her sisters, as well as an Essie nail polish. Speaking to FEMAIL recently, Kim said: 'As far as products, I love the Kardashian Beauty dry shampoo and conditioner, which we have. I've never seen a dry conditioner out there but it really helps when you're trying to not wash your hair.' Another product the sisters swear by is coconut oil, which they say is 'everything'. 'When I take off my make-up, I use avocado oil or coconut oil and I also sleep in it, it's amazing for dry hair,' explained Khloe. 'You can put it on your body, too. Coconut oil can do everything.' When it comes to grooming her brows, Kim calls on Anastasia Soare, who is known in Tinseltown as 'the queen of eyebrow shaping'. The brow groomer uses the Dipbrow Pomade, which she applies with her £15.50 Brow Wiz, an ultra-fine brow pencil, which claims to fill in sparse brows for a naturally fuller appearance. She then defines and enhances the brows with her £17 Brow Powder Duo, which is enriched with Vitamins C and E to nourish and protect, before sealing the powder make-up into place with her £15 Beauty Genius Clear Waterproof Gel, which she says seals and waterproofs any loose powder. To remove the day's face, Kim uses a Black Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System, left, loves to spritz her face with a £12 ($18) rose water mist from Glossier, centre, and protect her skin from the sun with a £65 ($96) Creme de la Mer SPF 30 UV Protecting Fluid, right . As well as running a successful beauty empire with her sisters, Kim has revealed that she wants to design a range of handbags for toddlers. The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star - who has 22-month-old daughter North with husband Kanye West - is set to launch her Kardashian Kids collection next week and has revealed she's already thinking about adding more accessories to the range. Asked about designing shoes or handbags, she told Vogue.com: 'Well, North does love handbags. And anything where there's a little bit of glitz.' When it comes to grooming her brows, Kim calls on Anastasia Soare, who is known in Tinseltown as 'the queen of eyebrow shaping' The 34-year-old beauty admits that while her daughter is a big fan of fancy shoes, she's not so keen on the range of headbands included in her mother's new collection. Kim explained: 'Every day she wakes up and says, ""shoes"". You have to bargain with her - before you change her diaper she needs a pair of shoes on ... She hasn't been the biggest fan of keeping something on her head.' Kardashian Kids launches on Nordstrom.com on April 13 with prices ranging between $25 (£16.80) and $35 (£23.60) and Kim admits that while she did a lot of research online, she also drew inspiration from her own wardrobe which is why the collection features pieces such as peplum tops and faux leather leggings.

"A tunnel could be built under Mount Everest as part of a new railway between China and Nepal, it has been revealed. Chinese state media has reported that the government is planning to expand the Qinghai to Tibet railway 'at Nepal's request' - which could include a tunnel under the world's tallest mountain - by 2020. The step is important politically as it shows Beijing building links with Nepal, a country India regards as firmly within its sphere of influence. A tunnel could be built under Mount Everest in the Himalayas as part of grand new plans announced by China . Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi visited Kathmandu in December and, according to Nepalese reports, said the line could eventually be extended to the Nepalese capital and further - creating a crucial link between China and the huge markets of India. 'The line will probably have to go through Qomolangma so that workers may have to dig some very long tunnels,' expert Wang Mengshu told the Chinese Daily newspaper, referring to Everest by its Tibetan name. He said that, due to the challenging Himalayan terrain with its 'remarkable' changes in elevation, trains on any line to Kathmandu would probably have a maximum speed of 120 kilometres per hour. The new plans underline China's increasing influence in Nepal, after years of improving the infrastructure of the nation. A map shows where the extension of the Qinghai-Tibet railway could be built - under Mount Everest . As well as building roads, it has invested billions of dollars in hydropower and telecommunications. Chinese tourism to Nepal, which is home to eight of the world's 14 peaks over 8,000 metres, is also climbing. Beijing's increasing role has raised alarms in New Delhi that China, already closely allied to Pakistan, is forging closer economic ties with Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Nepal in a deliberate strategy to encircle India. In an apparent counter-move, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged late last year that South Asia's largest economy would fund a series of regional investments and free up its markets to its neighbours' exporters. A train run along the existing Qinghai-Tibet railway towards Lhasa, capital of China's Tibet Autonomous Region . But India has struggled to compete with China's financial strength. Human rights groups have criticised China's plans to expand the rail network in Tibet. The International Campaign for Tibet has warned of the project's 'dangerous implications for regional security and the fragile ecosystem of the world's highest and largest plateau'. 'The Chinese government's claim that rail expansion on the plateau simply benefits tourism and lifts Tibetans out of poverty does not hold up to scrutiny and cannot be taken at face value,' ICT president Matteo Mecacci said in a statement last year."
"EDF boss Jean-Bernard Levy joined officials from the UK, France and China at the behind-closed-doors ceremony in London on Thursday.
Earlier this month, the government gave the go-ahead for the plant which will power nearly six million homes.
It will be the UK's first new nuclear plant in a generation.
The meeting was a second attempt at finalising the deal after Prime Minister Theresa May unexpectedly announced in July that she wanted time to scrutinise it.
With her approval now granted and the contracts updated, the formal signing took place at a ceremony attended by Business Secretary Greg Clark and French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
China's National Energy Administration director, Nur Bekri, and the chairman of Chinese firm CGN, He Yu, also attended.
Mr Clark said that signing the contract was a ""crucial moment"" and that Hinkley played ""an important part in ensuring our future low-carbon energy security"".
Mr Ayrault said he was pleased that the UK government had decided to go ahead with the project.
Q&A: What is Hinkley Point and why is it important?
How much would Hinkley C cost bill payers?
What does China get out of Hinkley?
Dozens of contracts running to thousands of pages for the huge project in Somerset are believed to have been prepared ahead of the event.
The key document is the Contract for Difference, or CfD, which gives a guaranteed price for the electricity Hinkley will generate for 35 years.
In return EDF, along with CGN, will finance the project and shoulder the risk of any delays.
Critics say the guaranteed ""strike price"" - which is more than twice the current wholesale cost of electricity - will provide a windfall for EDF for decades to come.
The formal go-ahead for Hinkley also cements China's foothold in Britain's nuclear industry.
The last government signed a series of co-operation agreements in civil nuclear power with Beijing which opened the UK's market to Chinese firms.
CGN will pay about a third of the cost of Hinkley. Under its agreement with EDF, it will also have a stake in a new plant at Sizewell in Suffolk.
The Chinese will then be allowed to develop their own reactor technology at Bradwell in Essex, subject to planning and regulatory approvals.
The government is now expected to publish some of the key documents linked to the deal. These will include the Contract for Difference and the waste transfer agreement that covers nuclear waste generated by the plant.
After numerous delays, EDF's board agreed to proceed with the controversial project back in July.
But just weeks after taking office, Prime Minister Theresa May ordered a review of the deal, leading to questions over the UK's openness to foreign investment.
Her government gave its approval two weeks ago on condition that it could prevent EDF from selling its controlling stake before completion of the project.
EDF's board approved the new terms on Tuesday, paving the way for the formal signing of the deal.

"Schoolgirl killer Zbigniew Huminski (pictured) did not offer a word of remorse as he was indicted for kidnapping, raping and murdering a nine-year-old . Calais schoolgirl killer Zbigniew Huminski did not offer a word of remorse as he was formally charged with a range of crimes which are likely to see him jailed for life, prosecutors said today. The 38-year-old appeared before a judge on Friday night and was indicted for kidnapping, raping and murdering the nine-year-old identified solely by her first name of Chloe. Despite being banned from France for earlier offences, Zbigniew was on his way to England on Wednesday from Calais when he struck. A statement released by Boulogne prosecutors said: 'The investigating judge conducted his indictment for the following reasons: rape of a minor, kidnapping and murder. 'During his interrogation, the person in custody had admitted his involvement in the alleged crimes, but failed to state the reasons for his action.' Confirming that Huminski had been 'placed in custody in a regional prison', his lawyer Antoine Deguines said: 'He did not speak to the judge, as his right. 'I have not been able to speak much with him, he does not talk much and, it seems, is in shock over what happened. It's hard for him to address the facts'. Asked if Zbigniew had offered any remorse, Mr Deguines said: 'No, he is saying very little about anything.' It came as thousands prepared to take to the streets of Calais on Saturday to take part in a second 'White March' to pay tribute to Chloe, whose funeral will take place in the port city's St Peter's Church on Wednesday. Mr Deguines confirmed Huminski had been on his way to see his sister in Southampton when he 'stopped for a beer' in Calais, and then attacked Chloe while drunk. Huminski was supposed to be in prison in Poland - but he exploited his home country's lax justice system to travel to France instead. This picture was the last taken of nine-year-old Chloe at 2.31pm - she is seated in front of her family home. Relatives have put this photograph at the scene where she was kidnapped . The career criminal was sentenced to a year behind bars in March, but under the rules in Poland, he was supposed to take himself to jail. But he hit the road for France and, under the EU's free movement rules, there was nothing to stop him driving across Europe. Nine-year-old Chloe, seen in a last haunting photo posing with a carefree grin in the playground outside her home, was snatched as her terror-stricken mother tried helplessly to reach her. Huminski has confessed to strangling his nine-year-old victim, identified by her first name of Chloe (pictured) Before Isabelle Hyart could do anything, Huminski bundled Chloe into his car and drove her to woodland where he sexually assaulted and strangled her. Huminski has a long criminal record in France and Poland, including once attacking a frail woman of 78 with a knife in her home. He was convicted in France in April 2010, when has jailed for six years for aggravated assault, before being released early in March 2014, when he was deported to Warsaw. Ms Hyart, a mother of two other young children, said: 'I'm appalled, disgusted. I don't understand why he was in France. And why did he come to Calais? I don't understand how anyone could do that to a child of nine.' Ms Hyart said the brazen abduction happened in broad daylight on Wednesday when she left her daughter in the playground to pop back inside the flat to change her four-year-old son's clothing. Huminski, who is single, originally moved to France in the early 2000s, and worked as an odd-job man before attempting to join the Foreign Legion as a soldier. He was rejected because of his long criminal record in France and Poland. Natacha Bouchart, the Calais mayor, said: 'How could a foreigner with many previous convictions be allowed to move freely around Calais? There is a clear dysfunction in the way we keep track of repeat offenders.' Last summer, Alice Gross, 14, was murdered by a Latvian builder who moved to the UK after serving a prison sentence for killing his wife. Arnis Zalkalns, 41, spent seven years in jail in Latvia but was still allowed in to Britain without having his record checked. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls called for a full investigation in to Huminski's past, saying Chloe's family deserved the 'whole truth'. Christine Taubira, the justice minister, also demanded a 'complete, precise and rapid' investigation.' The little girl's naked body was found in the woods near Calais 90 minutes after she was taken .

"Freshly laundered clothes still hang Friday in the dormitory at Garissa University College. Stuffed animals remain in one room. On the wall in another hangs a poster on proper preparation for Muslim prayer. These small reminders of college life at this Kenyan school belie the horror of what happened here: the slaughter of at least 147 people, many of them students who lived in this building. On Friday afternoon, more than 36 hours after the attack, investigators and Kenya Red Cross crews were finishing up the task of removing the bodies of dead students. The corpses of four Al-Shabaab attackers -- dressed head to toe in black and still clutching their AK-47s -- remained where they fell, their bodies shattered in a torrent of bullets. Kenya terrorist attack: 6 things you need to know . Investigators marked the locations of students' bodies with numbered tags before Red Cross workers came in to send them off to morgues. They would call out to each other with the locations of the dead, reducing once promising lives, for the time being at least, to numbers. 221. 214. 216. 217. Sometimes, the cell phones of the dead would ring, taking the workers aback. Beyond the bodies, evidence of what had happened at the dormitory was everywhere. Shattered glass and shell casings littered the floor. Walls and ceilings were marred by bullet holes. In some places, the blood was as thick as mud. The problems plaguing Kenya's security efforts . According to students and authorities, militants burst onto the campus around 5 a.m. Thursday. The gunmen, from the Al-Shabaab terror group, first stormed a Christian prayer service, killing some students, taking others hostage. They rampaged across the campus, shooting non-Muslims, sparing Muslims, a witness said. One student, Hellen Titus, told CNN she hid inside a wardrobe for nearly an hour before the gunmen came for her. Come out, they told her, you won't be shot. ""They were lying,"" she said. The gunmen herded her and maybe three dozen other students into a community room where they'd usually hang out and watch television. They were told to lie down, lectured about how the Quran forbids killing women. And then the men, Titus said, were shot in the head. One of the gunmen egged on the others. ""Shoot them! Shoot them!"" he would say, according to Titus. More lecturing: the land, the gunmen said, didn't belong to nonbelievers. We, the gunmen said, have just two missions: to kill, and be killed. And then they started shooting the women. ""Anyone who is breathing, shoot them,"" Titus said the gunman in charge said. ""We just lay there hopelessly, because we know automatically we're going to be killed,"" Titus said. It was then she saw the blood of a fellow student coursing toward her on the floor. She smeared it onto her face and body to make it appear she, too, was dead. ""In the time of shooting, they skipped me,"" she said. She survived with only a hand wound. Many of the other students were shot in the back of the head, a medic told CNN. Others had been beheaded, according to people who had viewed bodies at the morgue in Chiromo. Even longtime relief workers such as Reuben Nyaora with the International Rescue Committee said they were shocked at what they saw. ""I have seen many things,"" Nyaora told Agence France-Presse, ""but nothing like that."" Opinion: A weakened Al-Shabaab lashes out . CNN's Michael Pearson wrote from Atlanta. CNN's David McKenzie and Lillian Leposo reported from Kenya. CNN's Dominique van Heerden and Soni Methu contributed to this report."
"A New York woman has worn the same ensemble to work every day for three years. Matilda Kahl, an art director at Saatchi & Saatchi, wears the exact same ‘uniform’ – an outfit made up of black trousers, white shirt and a custom leather rosette – every single day because, as she explains to DailyMail.com: 'When at work, I want to be judged on my work and my work only.' In an article for Harper's Bazaar, Matilda explained that the unique sartorial idea came to her after a particularly stressful morning when, with 'a fairly important meeting on the horizon' she began trying on a variety outfits to no satisfaction. Scroll down for video . Empowering: Saatchi & Saatchi art director Matilda Kahl has got everyone talking about her everyday work 'uniform' 'I'm given complete freedom over what I wear to the office, but that still left me questioning each piece that I added or subtracted from my outfit,' she wrote. '[I kept thinking], ""Is this too formal? Is that too out there? Is this dress too short?"" I finally chose something I regretted as soon as I hit the subway platform.' Arriving at her meeting late, frazzled and wearing an inside-out sweater, while her male colleagues and new boss looked relaxed and at-ease, left her feeling frustrated and wondering why she'd bothered with the stress of it at all. 'I knew my male colleagues were taken seriously no matter what they wore - and I highly doubted they put in as much sartorial time and effort as I had,' she writes. 'But gender issues aside, I needed to come up with a solution to simplify this morning struggle.' Vowing to never let herself feel that way again, Matilda made the decision to make the same simple, easy wardrobe choices as many of her male colleagues did, wearing the same outfit each and every day, thereby eliminating the seemingly endless struggle to determine what to wear. Simple, yet effective: Matilda achieved her look by buying blouses in bulk and pairing them only with black trousers . She found her sartorial salvation in the form of 15 identical white silk blouses and several pairs of simple black trousers. For a 'personal touch' she added a custom-made leather rosette in homage to her mother, who used to love putting bows in her hair. She also throws on a black blazer for the chillier days. 'I’ve always thought black and white looks stylish, so it was a pretty easy decision on the color,' she explains to Daily Mail Online, adding that she took her time deciding on the exact designs. 'I finally fell for the white shirt for its diagonal button line and the cuts in the sleeves. 'New York gets really hot in the summer, so as an alternative to the 6 pants I bought 2 matte black skirts. Simple and sweet.' With her identical every day look, Matilda is following in the footsteps of many high-powered individuals, from Steve Jobs to Mark Zuckerberg - who says he owns 20 identical grey t-shirts for work. All tied up: Matilda tops off her look with a simple black leather bow, which she calls her 'personal touch' inspired by her mother's affinity for bows in her hair . But despite many people trying out the trend before her, Matilda admitted that she faced 'mixed reactions' to her new uniform idea from her co-workers. She was asked if she had lost a bet, joined a cult and some even assumed she was too destitute to afford other work clothing. But when confronted with endless questions about her new look, she shot back with: 'Have you ever set up a bill for online auto-pay? Did it feel good to have one less thing to deal with every month?' Many critics also wonder: why doesn't she just choose her outfit the night before? 'To me, that would only move the problem to another time of day, not really solving it,' she says. 'It would just make me go to bed later and lose valuable sleep. 'Nor would it solve the pressure of constantly feeling that I have to express my creative ability through my way of dressing, which is something I feel relieved from now with the uniform.' According to Matilda, the criticism has done nothing but reassure her of her choices. 'People have really put it to the test, and I’m happy to say the more questions I get the more sure I become of that I’m happy with my choice of wearing a uniform,' she explains. All in all, Matilda is immensely pleased with her decision, saying it has saved her huge amounts of money– and also removed a source of stress from her life completely. She also claims it has given her a new sense of control. Coming up to three years in her look, Matilda doesn't see herself stopping anytime soon - but insists that if the mood strikes her, she could go back to planning her daily wardrobe. 'I still feel like it does a good job for me so I see no reason for stopping wearing the uniform,' she says. 'But if I would wake up one day and feel like start spending time on picking out an outfit every morning, I’d no problem with giving it up. The uniform is here for me, I’m not here for the uniform.' She does however admit that she has had to re-stock her collection of white shirts - because the 15 that she bought originally have become so worn out that she is no longer able to wear them. 'They are all exactly the same and have been for almost three years, up until a week ago,' she added to Harper's Bazaar. 'The shirts had gotten worn out, others stained....So last weekend I spent two days on a rather intense hunt for a new hero shirt. I finally found it at Zara.'"
"That little voice inside your head that tells you to keep eating is, in fact, simply a cluster of around 10,000 brain cells. Now scientists believe they have found tiny triggers inside those cells that give rise to this 'voice' and ruin a dieter's good intentions. The new research, done on fish and mice, could someday lead to pills that will be able to quieten that voice or increase its volume. The research focused on POMC neurons, which are a structure called the hypothalamus, that send and receive signals to regulate appetite. On the left, images of normal hypothalamus POMC cells from a developing mouse. On the right: when the gene for the transcription factor is deleted, the cells no longer make it . The research focused on POMC neurons, which are a structure called the hypothalamus, that send and receive signals to regulate appetite. When POMC neurons are absent, or not working properly, animals and humans grow dangerously obese. The new findings show in animals that the same thing happens when certain genetic triggers inside the POMC cells aren't working. The team, led by the University of Michigan, looked at how a protein called a transcription factor, and two small stretches of DNA called enhancers, act as triggers for the Pomc gene. All three regulate how often and when the POMC cells use the gene to create the signal molecules that then go out to the body. That little voice inside your head that tells you to keep eating is, in fact, simply a cluster of around 10,000 brain cells. Now scientists believe they have found tiny triggers inside those cells that give rise to this 'voice' 'The POMC region is a central node of the brain's means for regulating body weight, in response to influences from the hormone leptin,' said Malcom Low, a professor in the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology. Like signal lights that show pilots the path to an airport runway, enhancers guide proteins toward the gene so it can be read. Located deep inside the brain, in a structure called the hypothalamus, the cluster of POMC neurons act as a control center for feelings of fullness or hunger. They take in signals from the body, and send out chemical signals to regulate appetite and eating. When POMC neurons are absent, or not working correctly, animals and humans grow dangerously obese. The latest research show in animals that the same thing happens when certain genetic triggers inside the POMC cells aren't working. The researchers found that the two enhancers act in ways that complement one another, both encouraging the expression of the Pomc gene at key times. Mice born without both of them became obese – as if their Pomc gene had been deactivated. The protein that latches on to the enhancer, called a transcription factor, is also vital. In the new PNAS paper, the researchers report that the transcription factor Islet 1, encoded by the Isl1 gene, plays this important role for POMC. When the researchers blocked cells of the hypothalamus from making Islet 1 halfway through pregnancy, the fetal mice failed to develop any POMC cells. 'Taken together, this work represents the first example of a neuron-specific gene in vertebrates where we have found both the enhancers and a shared transcription factor that control gene expression in the developing brain and then throughout the life span of the adult,' says Low. Looking to see if the same factors do the same thing in humans will be more complex – and there may be other enhancers and transcription factors involved. But in theory, it could be possible to find drugs to increase the production of Pomc gene products, or to help silence it. 'For humans, Pomc regulation may be part of the equation of weight control,' says Low. 'We don't know, but we think it likely, that it may be similar to the mouse model, where its role is like a dial, with a linear relationship between the amount of Pomc expression and the degree of obesity.'"

Last month, two Icelandic sisters attempted the trick by sucking into a hairspray lid, and warned others against it after the stunt went disastrously wrong. Yrja Ás Baldvinsdottir, 18, and her sister, Bir­gitta Ás, from Reykjavik, were left with swollen and blue bruised lips. Writing on Facebook, Yrja As said: 'I wanted to warn people against do-it-yourself lip expansion, but was really surprised and shocked that it ended up being something that loads of people were copying. 'I just wanted to try it and see what they would look like, I've never done it before, and I won't be doing it again. It was very, very painful. My lips turned blue.' One boy expertly demonstrates just how extreme the effects can be if you try hard enough . Sore-looking red marks are visible around the lip line of this dejected experimenter . As for Kylie herself, the 17-year-old Kardashian clan member has recently denied artificially enhancing her lips, despite much speculation to the contrary. 'I haven't had plastic surgery,' she told Grazia Daily. 'I've never been under the knife. People flashback to pictures of me when I was 12 and say ""Kylie's so different"" but how can I look the same from 12 -18?' Kylie has reacted to the challenge by taking to Twitter to say: 'I'm not here to try & encourage people/young girls to look like me or to think this is the way they should look.' She added: 'I want to encourage people/young girls like me to be YOURSELF & not be afraid to experiment w your look.' Plenty of Twitter users have been quick to ridicule the craze, labelling it 'dumb' and 'gross' 'I screwed up,' wrote one teenage girl along with her #kyliejennerchallenge selfie, while another complained she looked 'gross' We can only hope this particular trend dies out as fast as it gained steam ."
"Vijay Chokal-Ingam claims that he posed as a black man while he applied to medical schools in 1998 because he believed he had a better chance of gaining acceptance . After opening up about his experiences of posing as a black man to apply to medical schools, Mindy Kaling’s older brother has said that his sister does not approve of his actions. On his blog, Almost Black, Vijay Chokal-Ingam said that none of his family approves of his book, in which he’ll controversially claimed he was only accepted into medical school in the late 1990s because he posed as a black man. ‘My sister Mindy Kaling (Vera Mindy Chokalingam), of the Mindy Project and Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, strongly disapproves of my book,’ he wrote. ‘She actually said, “This book will bring shame on our family”. The rest of my family does not agree with the book. Still, they respect my right to make my own decisions with my career,’ he added. Chokal-Ingam says on his blog that he felt he had to change his appearance to get into the St. Louis University School of Medicine and heavily attacks affirmative action policies in the United States. 'I was determined to become a doctor and I knew that admission standards for certain minorities under affirmative action were, let's say… less stringent?' wrote Chokal-Ingam. 'I got into medical school because I said I was black. The funny thing is I'm not.' He claims in 1998 he shaved his head, trimmed his 'long Indian eyelashes' and joined the Organization of Black Students during the process. Though his website, AlmostBlack.com, shows side-by-side qualifications and pictures of Chokal-Ingam as an Indian-American man (left) and a black man (right), he doesn't specify if he went through the same application process as an Inidan-American man as he did a black man . His change in appearance was 'so startling that my own fraternity brothers didn't recognize me'. 'Vijay the Indian-American frat boy became Jojo the African American Affirmative Action applicant to medical school,' he said, claiming that Jojo was the middle name he was born with. As an Indian-American with a GPA of 3.1, MCAT of 31 and a member of the South Asian Student Association, he didn't think he'd get into medical school, but with a change of appearance and switch of student organization, he thought he could get into some of the top schools in the nation. 'I became a serious contender at some of the greatest medical schools in America, including Harvard, Wash U, UPenn, Case Western, and Columbia,' he said about the application process. 'In all, I interviewed at eleven prestigious medical schools in 9 major cities across America, while posing a black man,' he added. Despite his startling claims, Chokal-Ingam fails to mention if he applied to the same schools at the same time as an Indian-American man. He also does not seem to appear repentant about presumably taking a place at college that would otherwise could have gone to another person. Chokal-Ingam said that his sister, sitcom star and comedienne Mindy Kaling told him not to move forward with the book . When he was finally accepted to St. Louis University School of Medicine, he used the acceptance to claim he was only granted admission because he was black and used the situation as an example of what was 'wrong' with affirmative action. Indeed, Chokal-Ingam admits that he did not even complete his medical degree and dropped out before he qualified as a doctor. Chokal-Ingam also admits he found posing as a black person to be socially fascinating. 'Not everything worked out as planned,' he wrote on his website. 'Cops harassed me. Store clerks accused me of shoplifting. Women were either scared of me or couldn't keep their hands off me. What started as a devious ploy to gain admission to medical school turned into a twisted social experiment.' And unsurprisingly, Chokal-Ingam has been at the end of a huge backlash following his contentious claims. The Daily Beast claims that though his experience 'revealed inherent cultural bigotries that feed systematic racism', Chokal-Ingam didn't bring everything he could to the table. 'He chooses to sidestep, downplay, or flat-out ignore how the same racism that led to him being harassed by cops and store clerks keeps black applicants on the fringes of elite educational institutions for generations,' Stereo Williams wrote. 'It's easier for him to tap dance for the right wing as the brown man who “gets it”, while conveniently missing how ongoing racism makes affirmative action absolutely necessary,' he added. And though he claims he became a serious contender at schools across the nation as a black man, he doesn't specify if he went through the application process as an American-Indian man. 'Chokal-Ingam seems to have assumed that he would've gotten nowhere as an Indian American applicant and dove head first into this poorly-conceived 'experiment' before determining otherwise,' Williams wrote. And more so, Williams claims that Chokal-Ingam's experiment 'is insulting to what black people endure in this country, both institutionally and culturally'. Williams claims: 'And as a person of color, it's irresponsible for him to be so invested in the idea of individual exceptionalism that he ignores structural inadequacies. 'Black people can't be as 'racist' as whites societally, Mr. Chokal-Ingam. You didn't spend your time applying to black colleges in the hopes of finding work as a doctor in black-owned and operated hospitals. 'And a major reason why you were in a position to be considered for entry into any white institution is because black people generations before you made that possible through sacrifice and hard work. 'The attempt to undermine their work for the sake of promoting false 'equality' is truly regrettable. But when you conduct social 'experiments' that cite C. Thomas Howell's Soul Man as an inspiration, it's obvious that you don't take these issues all that seriously.' A spokesperson for Mindy Kaling was unavailable for comment."

Wales led 13-12 at the break but Fourie du Preez's try with five minutes remaining edged it for the Springboks.
Backs Tyler Morgan and Dan Biggar plus hooker Scott Baldwin joined Wales' list of injured players during the game.
""We don't want to make any excuses. South Africa won... and we weren't good enough to win,"" said Gatland.
""At the end of the day South Africa did what South Africa do. They got one chance and they took it and that was the result.""
Wales lost a trio of front-line stars in centre Jonathan Davies, full-back Leigh Halfpenny and scrum-half Rhys Webb to long-term injuries before the tournament began.
Two more centres - Cory Allen and Scott Williams - were then forced out of action in the opening two pool games against Uruguay and England, with wing Hallam Amos joining them.
Wales then lost the versatile Liam Williams - a full-back or wing - during their punishing final pool match against Australia.

Fly-half Biggar went off the field after a knock to the head just before the scrum which led to South Africa's try.
The player remonstrated with WRU medical manager Prav Mathema and team doctor Geoff Davies, but Gatland backed the decision.
""That's a medical call,"" he said. ""They took him off the field for a head injury assessment; it looked like he'd got a bit of a knock, he looked unsteady on his feet.
""He obviously felt that he was OK, but we support our medical team 100% so there's no issues on that from the coaching set-up.""
'We knew it was going to come down to fine margins,"" said  a ""proud"" skipper Sam Warburton, who lamented what he felt was a premature end to the campaign.
""It's a quiet changing room - it's hard to find the words, it's all so raw,"" he said. ""It feels premature with two weeks of the competition left. We've been together since June and all those gruelling camps… it's over, done and dusted.""
Warburton praised the players who had come in to replace the casualties, saying: ""The guys who've stepped in have done a fantastic job. This could be the last World Cup for many of us, but we go out with no regrets.""
Warburton was sent off in Wales' 9-8 World Cup semi-final defeat by France in 2011, and after this latest disappointment said: ""Hopefully I will be around when one of these tight ones goes our way."""
"More than 50,000 Britons have signed up to a scheme offering discount starter homes to those desperate to get on the housing ladder. The news comes as David Cameron today reiterates his pledge to offer the cut-price properties to 200,000 young first-time buyers. The project, launched last month, is part of a dramatic extension of the Help to Buy scheme – and doubles the number of new starter homes in England from 100,000 to 200,000. Help to buy: The extension to the scheme has been well-received with 50,000 people registering interest in the scheme since it launched last month . The properties would be at prices 20 per cent cheaper than their market value and reserved purely for first-time buyers under the age of 40. Mr Cameron will say today: ‘Home ownership goes to the heart of our political beliefs. It’s simple: we believe having a home of their own gives people and families independence; it helps people stand on their own two feet; and it’s one of the ultimate symbols of a country where if you work hard, you can get on.’ Figures published yesterday reveal 52,000 people have already registered an interest since the scheme was launched last month. The 20 per cent discount is possible because the new properties will be exempted from taxes and reduced construction costs thanks to the release of cheaper, brownfield commercial land to build on. Affordable homes: 50,000 Britons have signed up to a scheme offering discount starter homes to those desperate to get on the housing ladder . As well as helping struggling young people wanting to buy a home, Tory strategists believe it will appeal to parents and grandparents worried about their families’ prospects of ever getting onto the property ladder. Each starter home will cost no more than £250,000 outside London and £450,000 in the capital. First-time buyers will also be able to combine the 20 per cent discount with a Help to Buy mortgage – which offers homeseekers a 20 per cent Government-backed equity loan. The Help to Buy equity loan scheme was introduced in 2013 to offer buyers a 20 per cent Government loan to buy new properties, worth up to 95 per cent loan to value. It was due to expire in 2016 but has been extended until 2020. Under Labour, housebuilding fell to levels not seen since the 1920s. The number of first time buyers also collapsed, falling 60 per cent from 501,500 in 1997 to just 185,000 in 2009. Although the total number of new houses being built in the 12 months to June last year rose to 137,780 – a 22 per cent increase on the previous year – the Government says far more must be done. But shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds criticised the Government’s record on home ownership, adding: ‘Warm words from David Cameron about home ownership will ring hollow for those young people and families who have been priced out of home ownership over the past five years.’"
"Legally, it needs at least 5% of local electors for a referendum to go ahead.
Those behind the petition say a mayor would offer more dynamic leadership and ""rise above party politics"".
Council leader Tim Warren said it felt ""unnecessary"" so soon after the elections. If successful, a directly elected mayor would replace him.
The council announced on Monday that it had received 6,818 valid signatures. A further 2,789 signatures were ruled to be invalid.
Directly elected mayors were created by the Local Government Act 2000 as one option for local government, as long as the idea was backed in a referendum.
Bath & North East Somerset Council said the threshold set out under the 2000 Act had been reached and ""it is anticipated that the referendum will be held early next year"".
In Bath, the council is run by a leader and cabinet system.
Philip Raby, one of the team working for a referendum, said they favoured holding it on 5 May 2016, the day of the police and crime commissioner elections.
He felt a directly elected mayor would offer ""visible and accountable leadership"" for the wider area - something he felt the current system did not offer.
Mr Warren said there were ""challenging budgetary issues"" to concentrate on and questioned whether there was much public appetite for a referendum.
Local petitions sparked referendums which resulted in elected mayors in Salford, Greater Manchester in 2012 and in Copeland, Cumbria in 2015.
The Localism Act 2011 allowed central government to trigger referendums for elected mayors - but of the ten held in May 2012, only Bristol voted in favour of getting a mayor."
"Police used tear gas on Tuesday to end three days of unrest sparked by the death of an Iranian asylum seeker.
CCTV images appear to show two detainees, one armed with a machete, lighting and throwing a petrol bomb.
Photos of the aftermath show broken windows, ransacked offices and smashed equipment.
The unrest began on Sunday after an escaped detainee was found dead. Inmates started fires and barricaded themselves inside a compound with weapons.
Meanwhile, a Border Force spokesperson confirmed that seven detainees who allegedly participated in the unrest were being transferred from Christmas Island to Australia's mainland.
""The detainees are travelling on a charter flight accompanied by security officers. Restraints are used where appropriate for the safety and security of detainees, staff and the aircraft,"" a statement provided to the BBC said.
Christmas Island is a remote Australian territory in the Indian Ocean, 2,650km (1,650 miles) north-west of Perth.
The facility houses asylum seekers alongside people, including New Zealand citizens, whose Australian visas have been cancelled after they committed crimes.
Australia's immigration minister Peter Dutton earlier defended housing asylum seekers with ""serious criminals"" at the detention centre.
Mr Dutton told the ABC that the asylum seekers held at the compound with the convicted criminals - including the New Zealand nationals - were only sent there after risk assessments.
""Some [asylum seekers] have had an extreme threat assessment worked up and that's as a result of their own behaviour,"" he said during a radio interview.
""That is the basis on which the [Australian] Border Force officers make a decision about whether somebody is at a high security facility or whether they are at a low-security arrangement.""
He blamed the unrest on ""a hardened criminal population that occupies the immigration detention centre"".
He also rejected suggestions that some of the New Zealanders held at the camp had only been convicted of minor crimes such as shoplifting and traffic offences.
Under controversial policies, Australia sends all intercepted asylum seekers to Christmas Island as well as Manus Island in Papua New Guinea and Nauru in the South Pacific."

"It said the compression ignition engine was up to 30% more fuel-efficient than its current engines.
It plans to sell cars with the new engine from 2019.
Last week, Mazda said it would work with Toyota to develop electric vehicle technology and build a $1.6bn plant in the US.
Mazda research and development head Kiyoshi Fujiwara said it was imperative for the company to pursue the ""ideal internal combustion engine"".
""Electrification is necessary but... the internal combustion engine should come first,"" he said.
Mazda said the Skyactiv-X, as it is known, would be the world's first commercial petrol engine to use compression ignition.
The technology breakthrough puts the firm ahead of rivals including Daimler and General Motors that have worked on compression ignition for decades.
According to Mazda, the fuel-air mixture ignites spontaneously when compressed by the piston in the new engine.
The carmaker said the Skyactiv-X combined the advantages of petrol and diesel engines to improve efficiency.
It has no plans to supply the engine to other carmakers.
The move comes as the car industry pours massive investment into electric technology in response to stricter emissions standards around the world.
The UK will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2040 in a bid to reduce air pollution.
In July, Volvo said all new models will have an electric motor from 2019. The Chinese-owned firm aims to sell one million electric cars by 2025.
Mazda also plans to introduce electric technology in its cars from 2019.
In theory, a compression-ignition petrol engine should have big advantages.  But it isn't easy to make technology work - and some of the biggest companies, including General Motors, have already tried.
So why should a relatively small Japanese manufacturer like Mazda succeed? Well, partly because - unlike the really big players - it isn't afraid to take risks. It has done in the past.
It's the only mainstream manufacturer, for example, which has persisted with rotary engines in its cars. Like compression ignition motors, they have theoretical benefits, but create complex engineering challenges.
Mazda's rotary has had some success. The company won the Le Mans 24 Hours race with it in 1991, and the latest version was fitted in its RX-8 sportscar. Popular with drivers, it was sadly unreliable.
If the new motor is to be a success, it needs to be reliable as well as efficient. And Mazda needs to be able to persuade regulators that petrol engines still have a strong future.
It may prove to be the perfect stop-gap, as electric cars are developed and charging infrastructure is created.
Or it may turn out to be a brilliant idea, which has come to fruition just a few years too late."
"Danniella Westbrook's cage fighting ex-fiancé has been arrested for allegedly assaulting and harassing her. Tom Richards, 25, was arrested yesterday morning in his home city of Swansea. After being held in a cell for 11 hours, the cage fighter was bailed at 7pm as police continue their investigation. It comes after Westbrook, 41, made claims on social media that her younger former lover had been violent towards her, posting a photograph on Twitter of her bruised hand. The pair were last seen together at an Essex pub last month (above) after splitting up in November . It comes after the 41-year-old accused her younger former boyfriend of violence online. She was seen last month with a black-eye. Richards strenuously denies the allegations and has not been charged . Richards, who is an MMA fighter, has vehemently denied the allegations against him.

"A pensioner has been fitted with a magnetic nose after his own had to be removed when he was diagnosed with a rare cancer. Richard Curry, from Loveclough in Lancashire, was told he had malignant melanoma in his septum, the thin strip which separates the nostrils. He was warned that he would have to have his nose removed to stop the cancer from spreading but could be fitted with a prosthetic. Pensioner Richard Curry, who wears a prosthetic nose attached to his face using magnets, after his own had to be removed when he was diagnosed with cancer . But in order to make sure that the new nose stayed in place, the 71-year-old then had to have magnetic implants inserted into his cheekbones and nasal cavity during a procedure at the Royal Blackburn Hospital. And now Mr Curry has spoken of his shock at how successful the operation has been of keeping his new nose in place. He said: 'Losing my nose was something of a shock but I didn't have much choice because this kind of cancer is one of the most dangerous you can get. The 71-yer-old had a procedure to have metal implants inserted into his cheekbones and nasal cavity in order to hold his prosthetic in place . 'I ws just grateful it was caught in time and removed, and when they mentioned they could attach a new one with magnets, I just thought it was amazing.' Mr Curry's nose was removed in 2013, after he spotted traces of blood in a tissue, and the implants were gradually inserted of the course of the next 12 months. He added: 'In the early days I wasn't quite sure how much adhesive to put on, and my stick-on nose would sometimes fall off in hot weater, for example. 'And there was an incident in Asda which gave the girl on the till a bit of a shock. 'The implants were all ready last September and I was so pleased with the results. 'It's comfortable and it looks good, and I've even still got my sense of smell. 'I just need to get it touched up for colour every now and then, like before going on holiday so it matches my skin.' Mr Curry, a retired civil servant, who lives with his partner James Rogerson now wears his new nose all day but removes it at night when he goes to bed. A check-up last month found no signs of the cancer returning when he met with prosthetist Tony Simpson, maxillofacial surgeon Gary Cousin and ear, nose and throat specialist Paddy Morar. Mr Morar said: 'Cancers of the nose are not that common at all, you probably only get one every three years or so, so this was a very unusual procedure. Mr Curry's prosthetic nose, which is held on by magnets. Specialist Paddy Morar says it is fairly common to use magnets to attach prosthetic ears, but was the first time they had used them to attach a nose . 'Magnets are used quite commonly with prosthetic ears, but this was the first time we had used them to attach a nose. 'Richard couldn't have radiotherapy so it had to be surgery and we were extremely impressed by his attitude throughout, he's a very strong character and a model patient. 'It just shows there is life after this kind of radical surgery.'"

"Couples have been decorating the Ponte Milvio bridge on the river Tiber with locks for several years.
They are meant to symbolise the locking of hearts, inspired by a story described in a novel.
The city council said rust from the locks, which hang off chains, is harming the fabric of the bridge.
The custom is inspired by a book by novelist Federico Moccia in which a couple place a bicycle lock around a lamppost and throw the key into the Tiber.
The gesture was meant to symbolise the couple eternally locking their hearts together.
It took off and clusters of padlocks can be found near other landmarks in other Italian cities.
It is not the first time city authorities have stepped-in to break the locks apart.
Last year the council started a round of padlock cutting after complaints from residents that it equated to vandalism.
In 2007 the then mayor of Rome introduced a 50 euro (£40) a fine on couples found attaching padlocks to the bridge.
The BBC's Rome correspondent, Alan Johnston, says many people in Rome like the custom, and the writer behind the trend has said the locks ought to be left alone."
"Birmingham-based West Midlands Police constables Wahid Husman, 48, and Tahsib Majid, 36, used their roles to conspire to steal quantities of Class A and B drugs, the force said.
Husman admitted drugs and misconduct offences on 7 August.
Majid was convicted on Tuesday after a trial at Birmingham Crown Court.
Five other men also admitted a number of offences on 7 August following the police investigation, the West Midlands force added.
Husman accessed police computer systems to feed information to a number of criminal associates, while Majid committed a Data Protection offence on behalf of an associate, the force said.
A surveillance operation, led by the force's counter corruption unit, captured the officers talking about drug dealing on duty and conspiring with criminal associates to steal a consignment of illegal drugs destined for Birmingham.
The group planned to split the drugs between them to supply for their own gain.

Police said an investigation revealed Husman had begun accessing police computer systems as far back as 2011, when he started to feed intelligence and information to some of his co-accused.
After his arrest, officers searched Husman's address and found Â£7,000 cash and heroin.
The officers, based at Perry Barr, were suspended following their arrest in February 2017 and now face dismissal from West Midlands Police.

"Ben Flower was given the honour of leading Wigan's victory song after helping them to a 30-20 win over Warrington on his return from a six-month suspension. The 27-year-old Wales forward did not get among the scorers but he did enough to impress coach Shaun Wane on his first appearance since being sent off in the Warriors' Grand Final defeat by St Helens last October. 'I thought he looked a bit serious, he's not done anything for six months,' Wane said. 'I was a bit apprehensive for him but I thought he played really well - he belted a few people - and he led the song in the dressing room. Wigan Warriors forward Ben Flower takes on Warrington's Micky Higham (left) and Roy Asotasi . 'It's good to have him back. He's been vilified in the press but he's a really nice bloke.' The return of Flower dominated the build-up to the Super League derby while the half-time announcement that Sam Tomkins is returning to the club on a four-year contract made it a night to remember for Wane. 'Everything is great,' Wane said. 'It's fantastic getting these players back. We should be very proud. It's a great coup for us, it just shows we do some things right.' On the field, winger Dom Manfredi provided the highlight with his second hat-trick of tries in five days as the Warriors three times came from behind to secure a fourth win in five matches to consolidate third place in the table. Ryan Hampshire, Anthony Gelling and Liam Farrell also touched down while centre Chris Bridge scored two tries for the visitors, who had led 10-0 after 10 minutes. Flower struggles to control the ball as Warrington forward Ben Currie lines him up the for hit . 'It was a bit of tick and pass at times, which is disappointing, but I thought our attack was good,' Wane said. 'We gifted them a couple of tries with poor one-on-one misses but it was win at all costs for us and we got the win. 'Competition is driving up the skill levels and we're going to get better. We are going to put a real complete performance in soon.' The defeat leaves Warrington outside the top four but coach Tony Smith was encouraged by his side's performance. 'It was a great effort by both teams and another great game,' he said. 'We produce some of the best games between us but, at the moment, we're coming out on the wrong side of them. 'I think both coaches will be looking for some improvement in defence but some special rugby league was played. Sometimes you've just got to go 'wow', it's pretty hard to stop if they are going to go to those lengths to score tries. Dom Manfredi crosses for a Wigan try despite the attention of Toby King . 'The start of the second half really hurt us, it sapped our energy when they were throwing the ball around like a basketball. 'The second half wasn't great for us but we're heading in the right sort of directions. It takes good performances to beat us. We're much better than a few weeks ago.' Smith had mixed views on the performance of 19-year-old Declan Patton, who was making only his second appearance in Super League. 'His kicking game was sensational and I love it when he's running with the ball but he got ragged around defensively at times,' he said. 'There are some aspects of his game he needs to step up. He learned some harsh lessons there tonight but he's a good kid and will take things in his stride.'"

Nicholas Dematteis, 39, flew into the rage while at restaurant Bocca East during brunch on Saturday afternoon, and demanded a free meal around 4pm because of slow service, police said. Dematteis was arrested and charged with assault following the incident, according to the New York Daily News. Police said New York resident Nicholas Dematteis, 39, flew into the rage while at Bocca East (above) during brunch, and demanded a free meal around 4pm after waiting an hour and a half . 'We heard yelling and glass breaking, restaurant patron Jason Wirtz told the Daily News. 'The guy was screaming, ''I'm not paying for it!'' There was some expletives used in there.' The 34-year-old manager made attempts to calm Dematteis down, who waited an hour and a half for his omelette, when he spewed a homophobic slur at the man, according to another manager Joseph Verdi. He then allegedly grabbed the manager's neck and slammed him against the bar. Verdi added that Dematteis, who he said appeared to be drunk, was 'a lot' bigger than the manager. As the 34-year-old manager followed Dematteis outside of the restaurant, he grabbed his neck and hurled him into an elderly woman who was standing on the street, according to the Daily News. The woman got up after being knocked over and witnesses said she left before police arrived at the scene. 'There was a hustle and bustle out here and she hit the ground pretty hard,' said diner Julie Chappell, who was seated near the sidewalk. Authorities said Dematteis was previously arrested earlier this year in January for breaking into his girlfriend's apartment, according to the Daily News. Dematteis, an Upper East Side resident who lives near the restaurant, was arrested and charged following the incident on Saturday, police said.

"Jamal Hakrush starts his job as deputy commissioner after months of violence between Israelis and Palestinians.
He will oversee policing in Arab communities where there is a longstanding distrust of the police.
A fifth of Israel's population is Arab and they often complain that areas in which they live are not so well policed and have poorer public services.
Their grievances have been supported by Human Rights Watch which in recent years has published several reports highlighting the discrimination which it is argued the Arab population faces.
Deputy Commissioner Hakrush, from the Galilee village of Kafr Kanna, will be in charge of a newly-created police division established to improve policing in Arab communities, The Times of Israel reported.
Deputy Commissioner Hakrush was formally appointed into his new position on Wednesday at a ceremony attended by Police Commissioner Roni Alsheich. One of his main responsibilities will be to stop illegal weapons falling into the hands of the Arab community.
Mr Alsheich also wants to reduce domestic violence, murder rates and other crimes in the Arab sector.
He and the government wants to recruit 1,300 new officers and construct several new stations in Arab population centres."
"Bridget Klecker, 42, died on Friday after being struck by a vehicle fleeing the police in San Francisco . A pedestrian was killed and another injured when they were struck by a car fleeing police during a wild chase through San Francisco, and the suspects involved were still on the loose Saturday. Officers tried to stop the suspects' stolen car around 10pm on Friday just moments after they committed the latest in a series of robberies while armed with handguns, police said. But the car sped off with police in pursuit and struck a woman in a crosswalk, killing her. The San Francisco medical examiner's office identified the woman on Saturday as Bridget Klecker, 42, of San Francisco. 'I just kept saying that this can't be real — this just can't be real,' Kristine Mendoza, 35, who described Klecker as her close friend, told the San Francisco Chronicle. She and Klecker had planned to attend Monday's San Francisco Giants home opener together and were heading to Mexico in two weeks on a trip, she said. Witnesses who were riding a cable car saw the black sedan go airborne, and the windshield was badly damaged, according to KGO-TV. The car later hit a second pedestrian and then crashed into another car before slipping away from police in the South of Market neighborhood. 'It was one of those unreal experiences to see a car speeding in the intersection at us like that,' Micaela Davis, 35, a passenger in the car that was struck, told the Chronicle. Davis said the suspects' vehicle ran a red light and the driver of the car she was in swerved to avoid it. Neither she, the driver nor a second passenger was injured. A close friend of Klecker (right) said that the pair were supposed to go to the San Francisco Giants season opener on Monday . Klecker was in a crosswalk at California and Kearny streets (pictured) when the car struck her. She died at the hospital . The black 2013 Toyota Corolla was found unattended on Treasure Island off the Bay Bridge, police said. The three men who were in it were still at large as of Friday night. Police were not able to give a comment of the status of the suspects on Saturday. The second person struck was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not considered life-threatening, police said. Two firearms believed to be thrown from the car during the chase were recovered. The suspects have committed several armed robberies during the last three days, including three on Friday night alone, police said. A white sedan was struck and totaled by the fleeing Toyota after it hit Klecker and another pedestrian. The Toyota Corolla was later found abandoned . The suspects are allegedly responsible for several armed robberies across San Francisco, including three on Friday night ."
"Mr Navalny could now be barred from running in the Moscow mayoral election set for September. He also joins a growing list of opponents of President Vladimir Putin who have ended up on the wrong side of the law or in exile, or have met their deaths in suspicious circumstances.
When Mr Putin first became president in 2000, he immediately set about curbing the power of the oligarchs - the group of billionaires who exerted huge influence over Russia's political system and media.
His first victim was media magnate, Vladimir Gusinsky, the owner of NTV, a station that at the time was highly critical of Moscow's war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya and was home to the satirical puppet show Kukly, which mercilessly mocked the new president.
When Mr Gusinsky refused to allow the Kremlin to influence NTV's editorial policy he quickly found himself charged with fraud in June 2000, and fled the country shortly afterwards.
Within months, he was joined by his fellow media magnate and political fixer Boris Berezovsky.
Mr Berezovsky is believed to have played a key role in helping Mr Putin into power in 2000. But he quickly fell out of favour with the new regime and sought refuge in the UK.
Mr Berezovsky continued to plot against Mr Putin and to be held up as a bogeyman by the Russian media until he was found dead in the bathroom of his Berkshire home in March this year. Police have said that there is no evidence of anybody else being involved in his death.
Perhaps most famously Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former head of the now defunct oil company, Yukos, was targeted when (like Mr Navalny) he accused Mr Putin and his associates of conniving in massive corruption.
He has subsequently been convicted in two trials of tax evasion and fraud. Following his second trial in 2010, Amnesty International recognised Mr Khodorkovsky and his co-defendant, Platon Lebedev, as ""prisoners of conscience"".
Mr Khodorkovsky is due for release in 2014, but there are signs that he could face further charges.
Political opposition to Mr Putin is becoming an increasingly risky business, with numerous activists facing charges or in jail.
Two members of feminist band Pussy Riot are serving two-year prison sentences for ""hooliganism motivated by religious hatred"" after performing an ""anti-Putin punk prayer"" in Moscow's main Orthodox cathedral in February 2012. A third member of the band had her sentence suspended on appeal.
Meanwhile, criminal charges of affray, incitement to violence and assaulting police officers are pending against more than 20 activists involved in disturbances at a demonstration in Moscow on the eve of Mr Putin's inauguration as president for a third term in May 2012.
Sergei Udaltsov, a left-wing leader of the protest movement, is under house arrest after being charged with incitement to mass disorder on the basis of video evidence shown on Russian TV. If found guilty, Mr Udaltsov (like Mr Navalny) could face a substantial prison sentence.
Some members of the Russian opposition, such as former Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, continue to defy Mr Putin despite regular harassment and detention for public order offences.
Like Mr Navalny, Mr Nemtsov is a member of the opposition's alternative parliament, the Coordination Council. He is also co-author of a report accusing Mr Putin of leading Russia to ruin.
Another member of the Coordination Council, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, has joined the growing list of Russia's political emigres.
But, as the fate of former FSB (Federal Security Service) officer Alexander Litvinenko showed, even exile carries risks for Mr Putin's opponents.
Mr Litvinenko died in London in 2006 after being poisoned by radioactive polonium.
It is not just oligarchs and politicians who have to fear Putin's disfavour. Journalists and TV presenters, too, have to be wary of offending the Kremlin.
Ksenia Sobchak, whose father Anatoly was Mr Putin's political mentor, was a familiar face on light entertainment shows on Russia TV until she joined the protest movement following the disputed parliamentary election in 2011.
Since then, her lucrative contracts on mainstream TV have dried up and her appearances have been confined to the niche liberal channel Dozhd - a refuge for several dissident journalists.
Mr Putin makes little secret of his hostility to journalists who challenge his authority.
Shortly after the murder in 2006 of Anna Politkovskaya, a reporter with opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta and fierce critic of the Kremlin's policies in Chechnya, Mr Putin dismissed her political influence as ""negligible"".
Ms Politkovskaya is one of five Novaya Gazeta journalists who have been murdered or died in suspicious circumstances since 2000.

"It was a cunning plot to steal more than £1.5million in gold bullion and jewellery. Using a flat-pack wooden cabinet as a ‘Trojan Horse’, one of the thieves was to hide inside. The gang then planned to put real money in a briefcase and show it to a jeweller at a pre-arranged meeting, before placing it on the floor. Then, while a price was being agreed at a nearby table, the man in the cabinet would switch the case for one containing counterfeit notes. The gang – posing as wealthy Italians – would then walk off with their money and the stolen jewellery. Scroll down for video . Jail terms: Luigi Arcuri (left), 73, Nikolic Giuliano (centre), 37 and Antonino Ballistreri (right), 45, were each sentenced to two years and eight months  for conspiracy to defraud and possession of counterfeit currency . The idea: They planned to put one of the men inside the desk, show the jeweller real cash in a briefcase and then switch this with an identical case containing counterfeit notes - which he would then take away . In construction: The gang posing as rich Italian businessmen built the cabinet so one of them could hide inside a large void in the middle and secretly switch a haul of Euros for fake money during a deal . Flat-pack desk: While a price was agreed, the money would be switched by the man hidden inside the cabinet for an identical brief case containing the worthless counterfeit notes . But the three men and one teenager were seized when police swooped on a conference room at a hotel in Manchester city centre – and found them assembling the cabinet. Officers suspect similar scams have been carried out across Europe, costing businesses millions of pounds. At Manchester Crown Court, Luigi Arcuri, 73, Nikolic Giuliano, 37, and Antonino Ballistreri, 45, were each sentenced to two years and eight months in prison. A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given 16 months. All admitted conspiracy to defraud and possession of counterfeit currency. The men had been negotiating the purchase of gold and gems worth £1.5million from Rockefeller’s in Manchester. They first contacted the shop by phone. This was followed by a visit by the teenager, who gave his name as Benjamin Berman, and Ballistreri, who called himself Mr Ferrari. Both were well-dressed and wore Rolex watches and ordered 41 high-value items including gold bullion and jewellery. Arrangements were made to meet at a hotel, where a ‘Swiss banker’, who would be in possession of the cash, would be present. Cash in the draw: The quartet are suspected of being part of a larger, highly organised gang responsible for defrauding businesses across Europe out of jewellery and gold bullion worth millions of pounds . Euros seized by police: Inside a drawer, officers recovered €2.2million in counterfeit money as well as £52,000 worth of legitimate Euro notes . Police, who had been tipped off, placed the teenager and Ballistreri under surveillance and monitored them as they returned to the shop and finalised the deal. They were observed going to the Thistle Hotel near the Trafford Centre before going to a supermarket where they bought a torch to be used by the man in the cabinet. Enquiries revealed that a phone number used to contact Rockefeller’s was also used to contact other jewellers in the region. Detectives also discovered that in November, the 17-year-old had tried to defraud Diamond Watches in London, Classic Jewellers and Camelot Diamonds in Brighton and had attempted to launder cash in Brighton Exchange. Police swooped and arrested the gang and found 2.2 million in counterfeit euros (around £1.5million) as well as £52,000 of legitimate euro notes. Detective Inspector Rob Cousen of Greater Manchester Police said: ‘This was a well-run, highly sophisticated scam. To catch them red-handed is a fantastic result as we have been able to stop them in their tracks and prevent them from committing a serious crime.’ Caught on CCTV: Two members of the group were observed going to the Thistle Hotel near the Trafford Centre, moving the flat-pack table on a trolley ahead of assembling it in a conference room . First floor camera: The men are pictured making their way through the hotel with their kit, before setting it up in a conference room. Police swooped on the room and found them busy assembling the wooden furniture . The men outside the shop: Detectives discovered that men purporting to be Italian businessmen had been negotiating the purchase of jewellery worth €2million from Rockefeller's jewellers (above) in Manchester . Grifters: The £1.5million gold bullion sting would have been worthy of the TV show Hustle, starring (from left) Robert Glenister, Matt Di Angelo, Adrian Lester, Rob Jarvis, Kelly Adams and Robert Vaughn ."

River Plate vice president Matias Patanian admits the club 'dream of Falcao' and that 'the doors are open' The 29-year-old has struggled during a season-long loan spell at Old Trafford this term - scoring just four Premier League goals - and it remains to be seen whether United will exercise the option to keep the frontman or whether he will return to parent club Monaco. However, Falcao has been in good goalscoring form for his countrythis week, finding the net three times in two games to equal Colombia’s all-time goalscoring record with 24 goals. Joining River Plate at the age of 15 in 2001 before making his first-team debut four years later, Falcao went on to score 34 goals in 90 appearances for the Primera Division club.

"A down-on-their-luck couple from Ohio struggling with chronic conditions that left them unable to make a living were found dead from self-inflicted carbon monoxide poisoning this week, less than two months after their desperate pleas for help went ignored. Randy and Jodi Speidel, from Bellefontaine, created online fundraisers on GiveFroward.com and GoFundMe.com in late February begging Good Samaritans for financial help. Mrs Speidel wrote that they had been living without gas all winter, had no running water and were close to having their electricity and Internet service shut off. Hopeless: Randy and Jodi Speidel, from Bellefontaine, Ohio, took their own lives this week, more than two months after they created online fundraisers begging for financial help . Heartbreaking: The middle-aged couple died from self-inflicted carbon monoxide poisoning caused by two charcoal grills they had dragged into their bedroom . Last-ditch effort: Mrs Speidel wrote on GiveForward.com in late February that they had been living without gas all winter, had no running water and cut down their food intake to one meal a day . After having paid $500 to their landlord to prevent their immediate eviction, Mrs Speidel stated that they were left with only $33 to their name. To stretch their meager funds a little farther, the impoverished, ailing couple were forced to limit their food intake to a single meal a day and did not have enough scraps to feed their two cats. ‘I have turned in every direction possible and don’t know what else to do,’ she wrote. ‘If you can help, we will be forever grateful and will even pay you back once we get back on our feet.’ The Speidles were hoping to raise $1,000, but the online campaign failed to draw any donations whatsoever. On Tuesday, the couple's landlord, Doug Elleman, arrived at their rental at 225 West High Avenue to discover a pink handwritten note warning passersby of carbon monoxide inside, reported Bellefontaine Examiner. Firefighters who were called to the scene entered the residence and discovered a pair of charcoal grills filled with smoldering coals. Jodi Speidel, 46, and her 45-year-old husband, Randy, were pronounced dead at the scene. Orpahns: The couple leave behind two daughters, Randa (pictured right as a baby with her father) and 20-year-old Kira Speidel . Columbus Dispatch reported that a note found nearby confirmed that the husband and wife had made a suicide pact. The couple had removed their beloved pet cats from the house to spare their lives. They were later found wandering outside. The couple leave behind two daughters, Randa and Kira Speidel. In a post left last month on her parents' GoFundMe.com page, which has since been removed, 20-year-old Kira called the couple 'the hardest-working people I know.' She went on to say that now that they can no longer work because of their physical ailments, 'they have nowhere to run.' Police Chief Brandon Standley said the town has resources available for people in need like the Speidels, adding that it's tragic that they thought they were all out of options. In one of her online pleas, Jodi Speidel mentioned she had applied for assistance and was told to wait. Her GiveForward.com campaign description indicates that despite her infirmities, Speidel was able to land a new job but needed some help to tie them over until her pay checks started coming in."
"A young father has paid tribute to the toddler son he almost lost by getting a massive tattoo of the boy's portrait on the left side of his face. Christien Sechrist, a 20-year-old from Houston, Texas, had a black and white image of his young son Perseus etched onto the left side of his head in July. But a snapshot of the tattoo is quickly helping the young father to gain national attention after it was shared on Imgur earlier this week. And despite his critics' negative reactions to his tribute tattoo, Christien told Buzzfeed that he doesn't regret his decision to get the controversial ink, even claiming that he would happily get it done again. Bold statement: Christien Sechrist (pictured) has a large tattoo of his son's portrait on his own face . The detailed portrait of the trainee electrician's son Perseus, which features his chubby cheeks and big eyes, takes up the entire left side of Christien's face, starting at the corner of his eyebrow and ending down by his chin. There is even some additional detail featured on his ear lobe. When he shared a picture of his new ink on his Facebook page last summer, Christien gave a shout out to the tattoo artist who designed the creation by thanking him for accurately rendering his son's image. 'Thanks Cody Gibbs for doing awesome work on me. Looks just like my son,' he wrote. But Christien soon found himself being berated by his friend Ashlee Nicole who asked if the picture was a joke. After Christien confirmed that it wasn't, Ashlee expressed her frustration with his choice of location for the tattoo, noting that the ink would likely make it difficult for the young father to get a job in the future. 'Why on your f****** face?! How are you ever going to get a real f***** job to support your son with a tattoo on your face?' she asked. Doting dad: The 20-year-old, from Houston, Texas (thought to be pictured with his son Perseus), insists that he has no regrets about his distinctive facial ink, and claims that his young son 'loves it' Snap a selfie: Christien has eagerly defended his facial ink to his friends on Facebook, many of whom questioned why he chose to get the tattoo in such an obvious location . 'It's not funny!' Ashlee continued. 'I'm going to make you come live with [me] so you don't do stupid sh** like this. Although it is a nice tat, you should have put it somewhere else.' Christien went on to call it a 'beautiful tattoo of a beautiful face on top of another beautiful face'. Meanwhile, another friend, David Overbey, predicted that regret would eventually set in. 'I give it [three] years before the regret starts [rolling] in,' he said, before noting: I'm not judging [though]. I think it's great work. But society frowns upon face tattoos.' Christien responded by saying: 'Well my son looked at it [and] smiled so that's all I care about.' Meanwhile, Derek Farmer argued that there are better ways to express his love for his son. Artistic expression: Christien already has a large tattoo design on the right of his face and the back of his head (pictured) Family ties: The doting dad posts numerous pictures of himself and his family on his Facebook account . 'You don't need a portrait of your child on your face to convince your love for him,' he wrote. 'It takes more than that.' Although not everyone was so judgmental. Cody Meyers commented: 'Yeah bro that does look sick, I plan on getting allot of art done [sic].' It's nine months later and Christien is still a fan of his ink, telling Buzzfeed that his son 'loves it'. He also has a large tattoo design of a skull and a flower on the opposite side of face. And contrary to popular opinion, the tattoo enthusiast said the his dramatic face ink has not affected his ability to find work."
"Thousands of people, including hundreds of school children, lined the streets of Norfolk today to wave farewell to the Light Dragoons. Around 250 men and women from the reconnaissance unit, which has most recently served in Iraq and Afghanistan, marched through the town of Dereham for the final time. They were supported by more than 4,000 well-wishers, many waving flags, who lined the streets to mark the conclusion of the regiments 15 year tenure in the county. They are set to leave Robertson Barracks in Swanton Morley this summer and move some 200 miles to their new home in Catterick, North Yorkshire. Scroll down for video . Final farewell: The Light Dragoons marched through the streets of Dereham, Norfolk, as they prepare to wave goodbye to the county .

Patriotic: Little Poppy-Louise Brook waves her Union flag as she sits on her grandfather's shoulders to watch her father, Lance Corporal Liam Brook, march past in the parade . Many of the school children who lined the streets are from military families and will be leaving their classmates to head to Yorkshire . The 250 men and women of the regiment were inspected by a number of officials, including the county's deputy lieutenant brigadier Richard Heywood . 'We've found ourselves putting some quite deep roots out here, whether it be in the local community or taking the dog for a walk on beautiful Norfolk beaches,' said Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel James Senior, according to ITV News. 'We've found a new home here so it will be a strain to leave here. But alas all good things must end and we must move onto what's next for us.' The Light Dragoons were originally mounted on fast horses and as a result were able to move quickly across the battlefield. Today, they sit on Jackal Fighting Vehicles and they are able to deploy anywhere in the world at very short notice. In 2009 the Light Dragoons were first given permission to march through Dereham with their bayonets fixed. The farewell parade through the town included military vehicles, a jet flypast and the Band of the Royal Armoured Corps. The deputy lieutenant of Norfolk, brigadier Richard Heywood, took the salute and inspected the troops. Many of the children lining the route were from military families and are also preparing to move to North Yorkshire. Showing support: Thousands of appreciative local people watched the parade, which featured more than 250 soldiers . Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel James Senior said: 'We've found a new home here so it will be a strain to leave here' The Light Dragoons will hand over their barracks to another unit in the summer after more than a decade in the town . The last parade came six years after the regiment were first given permission to march through the town with their bayonets fixed . The Light Dragoons have a proud 300 year history that has seen them take part in the Jacobite Rebellions, in the Waterloo Campaign, charge down the Valley of Death at the Battle of Balaclava, and be one of the first ashore at D Day. More recently,  the regiment was deployed to Iraq in 2003 to assist with the stabilisation of the country after Saddam Hussein's regime was toppled. They returned again in 2005 to battle counter insurgency and assist with the training of the Iraqi police force. In Afghanistan the regiment were involved in numerous operations to rid the country of the Taliban, as well as assisting with the creation and training of the Afghan Army. The regiment will hand over the barracks in Swanton Morley to1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards, in July."
"A white BMW 420 coupe struck the woman under a railway bridge on Bradford Road, Dewsbury at about 10:10 GMT, police said.
The road was closed for four hours, with a section of the nearby Lidl car park also cordoned off.

Sgt Carl Quinn, of West Yorkshire Police, said: ""Anyone who saw the collision or the manner in which the BMW was being driven prior to it, is asked to contact the major collision and enquiry team."""
"Now the complete ban is being lifted.  Until now, any man who had ever had sex with another man was barred for life from donation.
From 7 November the ban is being lifted in England, Scotland and Wales.   But men who want to donate must not have had sex with another man in the past 12 months.
This deferral period has been left in place because there is a ""window period"" after infection with blood-borne viruses where they are not detectable.
This window period is far less than 12 months.
The report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) says that for HIV it varies from nine to 15 days, depending on the type of test.  For hepatitis B, which causes liver disease, it is 66 days.
In Spain, the deferral period is six months following the change of a sexual partner, whether the would-be donor is heterosexual or gay.  In Italy the restriction lasts for four months following the change of partner.
By contrast, in the US, Canada, France and many other countries there is a complete ban on donations from men who have ever had sex with men.
Whilst welcoming the lifting of the ban in the UK, some still regard the one year deferral as too long.
Stonewall Chief Executive Ben Summerskill. ""To retain a blanket ban on any man who has had sex with another man in the last year, even if he has only had oral sex, remains disproportionate on the basis of available evidence.""
But Sir Nick Partridge, Chief Executive of Terrence Higgins Trust said: ""The remaining deferral regulation for sexually active gay men is based on their heightened risk, as a group, of sexually acquired blood-borne viruses.""
A one year deferral period for donation applies to other groups as well: for example anyone who has been sexually active in countries where HIV/Aids is very common, and anyone who has had sex with a prostitute.
NHS Blood and Transplant has a complete list of who can and cannot donate.
The hope will be that the shift in policy will lead to an increase in the number of donors.
If you want more detail about the reasoning behind the decision to lift the ban, then the full report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) can be read here."
"A 'monster' pedophile, 70, who molested at least seven girls was sentenced to up to 50 years in prison on Thursday. Jackson County Chief Circuit Judge Thomas Wilson told 'monster' James Tingley of Michigan 'the only money we should waste on you is the cost of a bullet.' Wilson continued by saying he thinks locking Tingley up for the next 25 to 50 years in prison 'is worth every penny.' Scroll down for video . Molested seven chuldren: James Tingley watches during his sentencing of 25 to 50 years in prison on criminal sexual conduct charges on Thui . 'Children will be a lot safer. They won't have to go through the victimization that the victims went through here,' Wilson told Tingley. 'Mr. Tingley, basically you are a monster who has destroyed the innocence of numerous children.' Mlive reports that James Tingley was convicted on March 3 of heinous sex crimes against two girls over a six year period. His crimes span a period of 50 years. During Tingley's hearing, Assistant Prosecutor Jennifer Walker told the court that police know of at least five other girls Tingley abused but they believe there may be more. 'The defendant, he has called himself ""Jim"", He has called himself ""Uncle Jim"" but I would call him a monster and a pedophile,' Walker said. Repeat offender: James Tingley, pictured on Thursday in court,  sexually abused at least seven girls, investigators said . 'The defendant has stolen the souls, or parts of the souls, of these children. He's used them to meet all of his sexual needs. ... He's been violent with them, with others he's treated them as a girlfriend and he's wanted them to be his wife. ... It's disgusting,' walker added. Timgley's attorney Eric White told the court that Tingley still claims he is innocent. White added that Tingley's health is declining and that it's unlikely he'll live past his first parole date which is when he turns 96. Tingley did not wish to say anything to the court. Prosecutor Jerry Jarzynka said he thought Tingley received a fair sentence for his cruel actions. 'Certainly when it comes to cases of criminal sexual conduct with minors we appreciate the judge handing out a stiff sentence and ultimately we want to protect our kids,' Jarzynka said. Mlive reports that Tingley's perverted accomplice Randy Stevens, 45, was also convicted of sexual misconduct by a separate jury for 'allowing Tingley to carry out a number of sexual assaults.' This is not the first time Stevens has been accused of aiding in child abuse. Stevens, a father of 14,  pleaded guilty to second-degree child abuse and a judge sentenced him six to 10 years in prison last year. Mlive reports that last year's conviction was related to Stevens letting his children visit another sex offender, Geoffrey Friant, who is now serving 30 to 80 years behind bars. Stevens will be sentenced on April 16. Both he and his wife, Bobbi Jo Stevens, have lost their parental rights to their children."
"She will become the new Bishop of Stockport.
The Church's ruling body, the general synod, voted to allow women to become bishops in July.
The appointment will end centuries of male leadership of the Church and comes 20 years after women became priests.
Mrs Lane said: ""It is a remarkable day for me and an historic day for the Church.
""This is unexpected and very exciting. On this historic day as the Church of England announces the first woman nominated to be bishop, I am very conscious of all those who have gone before me, women and men, who for decades have looked forward to this moment. But most of all I am thankful to God.""
While priests are normally in charge of a church, a bishop is in charge of a large area like a county - called a diocese - with hundreds of churches.
Some people within the church are against the change because they say tradition dictates that only men should hold the most senior positions.
But supporters say there is no reason that women shouldn't be in the Church's positions of power.
Churches in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland already allow women as bishops, but haven't appointed one yet."
"One of Britain's biggest babies has been born - to a mum who asked for NO pain relief. Brave Danielle Davies gave birth to Harley at nearly 12lb following an eight hour labour without any drugs.

She continued: 'We have ended up having to throw a lot of the new born stuff away and he is already in size two nappies.' Danielle's pregnancy bump was larger than with her first child . Danielle's pregnancy was induced following a health scare after doctors found she had a blood clot on her brain just one month before, she started to suffer severe headaches. She said: 'It just felt like a normal headache but it was quite scary really. 'It is common to get blood clots but it is unusual to get one on the brain. 'They didn't know if I was going to be able to push with the pressure on my brain, but I did.' Danielle, who already has a 19-month-old daughter Layla, stunned staff during the eight hour natural birth, which she managed to endure without any pain relief despite pushing for two hours. She said: 'I lost quite a lot of blood because of his weight but I tried not to show the fact that I was in so much pain. 'I just cant believe I did it on gas and air, I keep wondering how I managed.' Baby Harley was born at 1.13am on April 10. Dad Daniel Goldstone, 23, who works as a security guard, said: 'I was nervous because Danielle was in so much pain and it shocked me but I wasn't expecting my son to be so big. 'I'm proud of her and all the staff were brilliant.' Daniel, Danielle and Harley with the couple's daughter Layla . Danielle is now on clexane injections to thin out her blood and doctors are keeping an eye on her progress. She added: 'A few of my friends have seen him and they all think he is huge. 'Some have said he doesn't look like a newborn he looks about three months old. 'My bump was very big and now I know why.' Former community midwife Jean Anderson, who has delivered babies weighing up to 13lbs during her career, said: 'I think many more women are now being induced early because they are worried about big babies. 'Danielle is a beacon and it shows women can deliver big babies safely and easily if they allow their bodies to relax. 'It is a big baby and I am really proud of her.' Danielle and her son Harley ."
"The doctors' union said patient care was undermined when GPs were forced to see as many as 60 patients a day.
It called for more funding to allow GPs to spend at least 15 minutes with each patient.
NHS England said consultation lengths were up to doctors and there were no national limits suggesting 10 minutes.
However, the NHS Choices website does state that ""GPs spend an average of 8-10 minutes with each patient"" and advises patients to ""plan ahead to make sure you cover everything you want to discuss"".
The BMA, which published a report on ""safe working in general practice"" earlier this month, called for a reorganisation and warned that GPs faced ""unsustainable pressure"" from increasing workload and staff shortages.
The report said it was intended to ""stimulate discussion"" and put forward a model that could be used across the UK.
Dr Nicola Hulme, a GP in Cheshire, said she found NHS England's comment about there being no national limit on appointment times ""insulting"".
""With the high levels of demand, we have to run 10-minute appointments,"" she said.
""To offer longer with the same number of appointments would extend our day to beyond the 12 hours we currently routinely work.
""I often run late so I can deal thoroughly with my patients' issues.
""Paperwork gets started routinely after 7pm. I rarely get home before 8pm, having started generally at 7.30am.
""Nobody goes into medicine for an easy ride, we are all hard workers, but the intensity and the demand are now at unsafe levels.""
Dr Ali Alibhai, who works in central London, said GPs now had to manage so many chronic diseases such as diabetes that a consultation as short as eight minutes was ""not appropriate any more for safe patient care"".
Dr Brian Balmer, of the BMA's GPs' committee, said that, in an ageing population, many patients had complex multiple conditions that needed longer to treat.
He warned that many GPs were being forced to truncate care and deliver an ""unsafe number of consultations"".
He said consultations should be limited to 25 a day, about the same number recommended in many other EU countries.
Dr Balmer added: ""We need a new approach that shakes up the way patients get their care from their local GP practice.
""The consultation time needs to increase to 15 minutes with the government providing on its promised funding to make this work.""
Health think tank the King's Fund said its analysis showed GPs were under ""huge pressure due to an increase in workload which has not been matched by a growth in funding or the workforce"".
It also found the average length of consultations had increased due to the rising number of older patients with more complex conditions.
King's Fund chief executive Chris Ham said general practice needed ""new investment to stop it falling apart"", but GPs must also embrace new methods such as giving more advice by phone and email.
NHS England said the length of appointments was ""at the discretion of individual GP practices, based on patient need, and there are no national limits suggesting 10 minutes should be the norm"".
It accepted that GPs were ""under pressure"", and said it was ""substantially increasing investment and reforming care to free up GPs to spend more time with patients"".
In 2013, a rule saying GP appointment slots in England must be for a minimum of 10 minutes was scrapped.
One patient, John White, from Somerset, said: ""I think those who get a 10-minute consultation with their GPs are lucky.
""At my doctors' surgery I cannot even book an appointment to see my GP. All we are offered is to book a 'telephone triage consultation' where your doctor will call you by telephone and decide whether a face-to-face appointment is warranted.
""I have had to wait in excess of two weeks for the telephone appointment.""
Another patient, Maggy Jackson, said: ""I have a brilliant GP who sees me for as long as I need. He always runs on time too.
""All I can say is if it wasn't for this practice I would be dead. They diagnosed a gangrenous hernia two years ago when I presented with horrendous pain and no appointment. I was given a full examination, morphine and was in hospital an hour later after their intervention.""
Nurse Liz Wright said appointment length was also an issue in nursing.
""In years gone by, I had either 15 or 20-minute appointments to see my patients,"" she said.
""This has now been cut to 10 minutes, in which to carry out triage, cervical smears, dressings, injections, contraceptive discussions and issuing of prescriptions and a whole range of ailments.
""This means that in a typical 7.5-hour shift, I see up to 42 patients, well above the recommended daily amount.
""In my opinion this is unsafe practice and I have decided to take early retirement."""

"Bacary Sagna could end the season trophyless and lower than Arsenal in the Premier League but the Manchester City defender insists he has no regrets about leaving the Emirates for the Etihad. Sagna's acrimonious departure from Arsenal when his contract expired at the end of last season left many Gunners fans dismayed at a perceived lack of loyalty from the defender. The France international has played only 16 times for City this season in an underwhelming campaign both for him and the Premier League holders, who are languishing in fourth. Bacary Sagna (right) insists he does not regret leaving Arsenal for Manchester City last summer . Sangna (right) has only made 16 appearances and City are fourth in the Premier League, with Arsenal second . Sagna departed Arsenal on the back of winning the FA Cup but faces a year without a trophy at City . But the 32-year-old Sagna says if he was faced with the decision again, he would make the same choice. 'I see a lot of comments from fans saying I should have stayed at Arsenal but if I had to do it again, if I had to come back and sign for City, I would have done it again,' Sagna told the Manchester Evening News. 'I'm happy because I came to the champions.' Sagna departed the Emirates on the back of an FA Cup triumph but arrived at City with the club having won the Premier League. A year later, Arsenal are gearing up to defend their trophy against Aston Villa in the final at Wembley but City's Premier League title will almost certainly be claimed by Chelsea. Sagna is philosophical about how City and Arsenal's seasons have unravelled. 'When I signed I just wanted to come, give the maximum, and give my best for the club then after, it’s life, no?' Sagna said. Sagna (left) said he would make the same decision again if he was faced with a similar choice . Sagna believes Manuel Pellegrini's City side will soon return to winning ways and end the season well . Sanga also brushed aside fears that City could be usurped from the Champions League qualifying places and believes Manuel Pellegrini's side will swiftly return to winning ways. 'Everyone looks forward in the same direction, we want to be successful as a team and the coach and the staff and everyone is part of the team,' Sagna said. 'We are doing out best to get back to a winning team and to finish the season well.'"

"The Queen was today joined by her husband the Duke of Edinburgh as she met the Canadian Highlanders to mark the bravery of the country's servicemen and women in the First World War.

Several descendants of those of who fought in battle and current service personnel also attended the reception at Canada House, which is the home of the Canadian High Commission. The event was held in honour of the three Canadian regiments which the royal members individually lead as Colonels-in-Chief. The Queen wore a special diamond-encrusted white gold sweetheart brooch for the occasion, fashioned in the shape of the cap badge of The Calgary Highlanders for whom she is Colonel-in-Chief. The brooch was a token created especially for her by the regiment who are among a trio of Canadian military units who are on a European pilgrimage to mark the centenary of the 2nd Battle of Ypres, specifically the Battle of Saint Julien and Kitcheners Wood. Today's reception formed one of the highlights of events marking the centenary of First World War battles which are being commemorated by the trio of regiments, according to Canada's High Commissioner Gordon Campbell.

The Duke of Edinburgh smiles as he is saluted during his exit from Canada House following today's reception . Mr Campbell said: 'It is always exceptional when Her Majesty comes and joins us at Canada House, particularly now as this is the 100 year anniversary of the bestowing of the first military honours to Canadians. 'You can just feel, in the room, how important it is to everyone that she is here. 'It is really an honour and it is the sort of commemorative activity that is important to the soldiers and the service people who are involved.' Honorary Colonel Richard Talbot, of the Canadian Scottish Regiment, added: 'To have the three royal Colonels-in-Chief here in one room is unique. I do not think it has happened before. We are proud to be a part of this day.' Her Majesty's visit to Canada House comes just two months after she visited the central London establishment to reopen it following extensive renovations. In February, the Queen and Prince Philip were given a tour of the newly refurbished building before formally unveiling it. Her Majesty (pictured arriving at Canada House) looked elegant in a long blue fitted coat and matching hat . The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh appeared in good spirits as they arrived to a red carpet at the event . Her Majesty was welcomed into the venue, which she reopened herself in February following renovations . Of particular interest to Her Majesty was the atrium, which was renamed in her honour and features Canadian hemlock cladding and a swathe of red oak flooring. The atrium, although the newest addition to the list, is by no means the only place named after the monarch. In Canada alone, no fewer than 62 schools, roads, hospitals and parks are named after Her Majesty, among them an observatory, an island chain and two different mountain ranges. Elsewhere, the list of places named after the Queen includes a city in South Australia, British and Australian Antarctica and Queen Elizabeth National Park, which is famous for its beauty and tree-climbing lions, in Uganda. Earlier this week, the Queen appeared unusually nervous and was spotted crossing her fingers as she cheered on her horse in the Royal Box at Newbury. Unfortunately for Her Majesty, her horse Ring of Truth was narrowly pipped to the post - prompting a brief look of horror and a rueful smile from her owner.

The royal remains an enthusiastic equestrienne and, according to sources, is a familiar sight at her Windsor stables. She is also said to take a keen interest in all her horses and ponies, some of whom are now ridden by her grandchildren, notably Prince Edward's children, Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn. Along with her thoroughbred race horses, the Queen also breeds Fell ponies and has a stud specialising in Highland ponies at Balmoral."
"Motorcycles used as taxis and known as boda bodas are time-savers for people who need to get somewhere in Tanzania's north-western city of Mwanza.
They seem to be the only way to beat traffic jams. But when you get on the bike and wrap your arms around the driver, you are actually putting your life in his hands.
In the first half of this year, there were more than 5,000 road accidents in Tanzania. More than a quarter of them were motorcycle accidents.
Boda boda drivers are often blamed for causing the problems on Mwanza's roads. They might get you where you want to go quickly, but they have a reputation for driving recklessly.
There are hundreds of them competing for fares, which increases the risk of accidents.
But that is also where trainee doctor Marko Hingi saw an opportunity to turn boda boda drivers into true life-savers.
He was inspired by the fact that wherever there is a medical emergency in Mwanza, there is likely to be a motorcycle taxi driver nearby.
""We have human beings here and we can use them as volunteers to help,"" says Mr Hingi, who works at a hospital in the city.
He is also head of the Tanzania Rural Health Movement, which recruits boda boda drivers and turns them into first-responders, acting like paramedics.
""In the past when somebody got injured, he bled while people looked at him until he died,"" says Anicet Mase, one of Mr Hingi's volunteer drivers.
Now Mr Mase zips around Mwanza wearing a fluorescent orange vest and a backpack full of bandages and other first-aid kit.
He and the other volunteer drivers have been trained in basic first-aid, such as keeping airways open, stopping bleeding and splinting fractured bones.
The drivers also have mobile phones and are linked to a system called Beacon.
Mwanza's fire station receives calls reporting emergencies.
A dispatcher enters the details into the Beacon software, which then sends a text message to everyone linked to the system.
If a motorcycle taxi driver is nearby, he can respond to the emergency.
""We've designed [the Beacon] to be used in countries that don't have the resources to implement a robust EMS [Emergency Medical Services] system,"" says Michael McGee, the East Africa representative of Trek Medics International, which developed Beacon and runs a similar programme in the Dominican Republic.
This ""robust"" service involves people calling for ambulances on emergency numbers such as 999, 112 or 911.
But this is expensive and does not exist in many poorer countries. It is up to the sick and injured to get to hospital any way they can.
When Mr Hingi was six he remembers his sick mother walking to hospital, worrying that wild dogs would attack her on the way.
That childhood memory inspired Mr Hingi's dream to become a doctor and bring ambulances to Mwanza.
""Communities are suffering because they lack a good system to help them,"" he says.
As for Mr Mase, he is driven by the idea that boda boda drivers are now given the opportunity to counter their bad reputation for putting lives at risk on the roads.
A big part of his work is to deal with injuries caused on the roads.
About 90% of the 1.25 million people killed every year in traffic accidents die in low and middle income countries.
However, there is a limit to what motorbike drivers can do to help.
Some of Tanzania's roads are in too bad a condition for them to reach patients and evacuate them safely.
So, even though the motorcycles in Mwanza find it easier to avoid potholes and wind through traffic, there is work to be done before boda boda drivers can really claim to be saving lives rather than putting them at risk."

Will Watson was speaking after calls for the mining firm to accept the ""moral responsibility"" for cleaning up two major sites at Margam near Port Talbot and East Pit near Ammanford following the collapse of a fraud case.
The cost has been estimated at around Â£150m.
Celtic Energy transferred ownership of the mines to a firm in the Caribbean, leading the Serious Fraud Office to accuse six people including two former directors of trying to avoid paying restoration costs.
A judge threw out the case.
Mr Watson, speaking to Oliver Hides on Radio Wales, said the firm had accepted that for Margam the prospect of further mining to help pay for restoration costs was not an option."

"Binge drinking might seem like a uniquely modern phenomenon - but in fact it is a time-honoured tradition, according to health experts. Ancient civilisations such as the Romans, Greeks and Egyptians have had to deal with rowdy, drunken behaviour in public for thousands of years. Now one academic suggests that modern authorities should take a lead from their forebears as they attempt to mitigate the impact of our boozy culture. Party: This relief from Herculaneum shows Bacchus, the god of wine, with followers at a frenzied gathering . Contrast: Health experts have compared ancient nights out to modern drinking spots such as Magaluf . Mark Bellis, who is honorary professor of public health at Bangor University, is giving a talk at a conference in Las Vegas this week about the history of binge drinking. In his lecture, entitled 'Lessons from the history of nightlife - 10,000 years from Mesopotamia to Vegas', he will examine how our distant ancestors balanced freedom with responsiblity in regulating nightlife. He told the Independent: 'We think we're discovering the problems of nightlife for the first time, but these have been with us for a long time. 'There's always been a tension in history: people want a safe night out, but they also demand freedom and an element of anonymity.' Vessel: A Greek amphora which could have been used for holding the wine which was drunk in large quantities at feasts . Many of the concerns of the ancient authorities were strikingly similar to ours, according to Dr Bellis. In Pompeii - where one of the best-preserved buildings after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius is a tavern - city officials installed street lights, only to face opposition from drinkers who were worried about sacrificing their privacy. The Greeks launched wide-scale campaigns to dissuade drunkenness, with playwrights using gods in their productions to warn against alcohol abuse. And in Egypt, one of the major concerns was mixing drink and drugs, as many locals would consume a narcotic flower called 'blue lotus' while knocking back beer, Dr Bellis says. He told the Independent: 'People look for an escape from the social and behavioural constraints of the day. That's what night has always been about.' The official preview of his talk, set to take place tomorrow, reads: 'The foundations of modern nightlife go back thousands of years to when people first abandoned nomadic lives to build and live in cities. 'Since then, countless cultures have added their own innovations and regulations in attempts to balance safety and security with excitement and anonymity. 'Looking back at how nightlife developed over the past 10,000 years, we can learn from history's successes and failures and develop a greater insight into the challenges posed by nightlife today.' The use of alcohol goes back to the Stone Age, and almost all societies around the world have made some sort of drink - despite the problems that come with a booze culture. Some of the earliest written texts, from Mesopotamia, make reference to alcohol - the law code of Hammurabi, from 1750 BC, contains regulations stopping tavern landlords from ripping off their customers. The Epic of Gilgamesh shows the eponymous king promising to distribute beer and wine to his followers 'like the new year celebrations'. Many aspects of Greek culture were centred around drinking - one of Plato's best-known texts is the Symposium, set at a huge drinking party, while wine even had its own deity in the form of Dionysus. However, to avoid excess drinkers were advised to water down their wine with water, and to drink more water between each cup of alcohol. Warning: Gin Lane, by William Hogarth, graphically depicted the dark side of booze culture . The Roman love of drinking is shown by the preserved city of Pompeii, where one of the buildings buried by volcanic ash in the eruption of Vesuvius appears to have been an inn. Rowdy feasts were also part of Anglo-Saxon society, as seen in the epic poem Beowulf, which could be a cautionary tale as it features the monster Grendel carrying off warriors who were tired out from a night of carousing. The Islamic world attempted to eliminate the problem of drunkenness with a religious ban on alcohol, but there are signs that this did not always work. The 900-year-old Persian poem known as the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam opens with an appeal for 'a jug of wine, a loaf of bread' to accompany an idyllic and romantic landscape. One tactic used to tackle alcohol abuse was to substitute less strong drinks instead of spirits - for example, in the Georgian era William Hogarth published two prints contrasting the hellish 'Gin Lane' with the relaxed and peaceful 'Beer Street'."
"Some 1,500 officers have been deployed to the Olympic Stadium area, authorities have said.
Officials are in high alert following Tuesday's attacks in Brussels.
Last year, a friendly between Germany and the Netherlands in Hannover was called off two hours before its start due to a security threat, four days after the Paris attacks.
One of the targets in Paris was the Stade de France, where Germany were playing France in a friendly match.
Some 72,000 people are expected to attend Saturday's match in Berlin between two of the favourites for June's Euro 2016.
In the hours ahead of the game, fans gathered around the stadium amid a heavy security presence.
They face security checks and bag searches before entering the arena.
""This is of course a very large event drawing lots of people. Like all large events, there is a certain risk involved, so we are well prepared,"" Berlin police spokesman Stefan Redlich told Reuters news agency.
""We searched the Olympic stadium with dogs trained to sniff out explosives before we let the fans in. So we can be relatively certain that there are no dangerous objects in the stadium."""
"Bobby Moore's granddaughter celebrated her wedding with an intimate family celebration in London yesterday. Poppy Moore, 23, wed her childhood sweetheart Sam Myers at Chelsea Register Office with only 12 loved ones before hosting a reception for 50 at the Mayfair Hotel. The bride wore a knee-length white dress and carried a bouquet of white roses, which poignantly also contained a picture of her father Dean, who died in 2011 aged 43. Scroll down for video . Poppy Moore married Sam Myers at Chelsea Register Office yesterday . Sam Myers with bride Poppy, her mum Sara and grandmother Tina Moore at Chelsea Register Office . She wore her hair in a half up-do, with a Sixties-style beehive - perhaps in reference to her grandfather's heyday. Her chic dress had white flower detail embroidered on the bodice, while layers of tulle gave the skirt extra volume. Among the guests were Poppy's mother Sara and her grandmother Tina, Bobby's first wife. Poppy was only 18 months old when her famous grandfather died in February, 1993. The England and West Ham legend who captained the 1966's World Cup winning side was only 51 when he lost his battle with bowel cancer. She and Bobby's two other grandchildren Freddie and Ava marked the 20th anniversary of his death in 2013 by placing the ball on the spot for a West Hame home game, the club he captained for ten years. Poppy Moore poses with her new husband Sam Myers and mum Sara . Poppy is also involved with the Moore Family Fund to fight bowel cancer. Her mother Sara told The Mirror: 'Bobby would’ve been very proud of his granddaughter and very happy. She is a beautiful young lady and a credit to us all. 'It was a very special day, it was lovely. Her father Dean would have been so proud of her, too. It’s such a shame that he couldn’t be with us.' The Moore family experienced tragedy when Poppy's father Dean died young. Poppy, who was just 19 at the time, paid an emotional tribute to 'the best man in my life'. Bobby, who would have been 74 yesterday, met his first wife Tina in 1957 and the pair, who lived in Chigwell, Essex, had two children Dean and daughter Roberta. They separated in 1984 and divorced in 1986 and Bobby got together with Stephanie Parlane-Moore, who he married in 1991.

Jenny-Lee, 28, was diagnosed with leukaemia seven months into her pregnancy, and although doctors at Sydney's Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick told her she could give birth via a caesarean section and undergo chemotherapy, she refused both options as they required her to receive a blood transfusion. However her mother Heather has told The Daily Telegraph that her daughter believed the cancer treatment would harm her unborn child, named Aroura. 'She knew chemo would kill Aroura — she put the baby first each and every time and no matter what happened, she wanted that baby alive,' Heather said. A pregnant Jehovah's Witness woman and her baby have died after she refused a blood transfusion . 'We were told she would have six weeks to live — she fought to have the baby. That's the decision she made — she gave up her life.' Instead she blamed local doctors for her daughter's unnecessary death, claiming they should have tested her for the cancer sooner, but instead only attributed her symptoms to the flu and her pregnancy. The Sydney mother's baby died in utero three days after she was offered a caesarean. She had a stillbirth and died 13 days after her diagnosis by suffering a stroke and multi-organ failure. Jenny-Lee's elder daughter Chelsie, who was only 10 when her mother died in August 2009, also defended her mother. However the 28-year-old's brother David blamed the religion for how his sister died, calling her a 'fool'. 'It was not my sister who was sad and selfish, it is this religion and any other teaching this sort of nonsense,' he said. Jenny-Lee, 28, had pregnancy complications due to her leukaemia but rejected treatment on religious grounds . Her treating haematologist at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick, Dr Giselle Kidson-Gerber, said the mother understood the risks of her refusal to accept blood. 'Her refusal to receive a blood transfusion meant that we were unable to perform a caesarean section and to deliver the foetus,' Dr Kidson-Gerber told Daily Mail Australia. 'Obviously it's a very big ethical issue. Legally in Australia the mother has the right to make decisions on her behalf and her foetus's behalf. 'Most mothers would make decisions in favour of the unborn baby and this was a decision that was not in favour of the unborn baby.' Dr Kidson-Gerber added: 'If we were to give chemotherapy without blood transfusion support she surely would have died.' She was being treated at the Royal Hospital for Women and the Prince of Wale Hospital in Randwick . Hospital staff were 'distressed' over what were perceived to be two avoidable deaths, as 83 percent of pregnant leukaemia sufferers go into remission with treatment. Dr Kidson-Gerber said it was a challenge to respect a patient who refuses life-saving treatment. 'It was sad. I think that I did my best to help her. But ultimately I couldn't change the course of events,' she said. In a recent article published in the Internal Medicine Journal about the 2009 case, Dr Kidson-Gerber and her colleague Dr Amber Biscoe wrote: 'Not administering blood products in this case undoubtedly contributed to the death of mother and foetus. 'Refusal of a lifesaving intervention by an informed patient is generally well respected, but the rights of a mother to refuse such interventions on behalf of her foetus is more controversial.' Sascha Callaghan, an expert in ethics and law at the University of Sydney said the current law allows the mother to make decisions that would directly affect her unborn baby, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. She said Jehovah's Witnesses are often condemned for their beliefs, especially in relation to their stance against blood transfusions. 'This woman has a long-held commitment to the Jehovah's Witness faith and that's how she chose to die,' she told the Herald. 'When your foetus is in utero, it is inextricably tied to your life.' Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions because they believe the Bible commands them to abstain from ingesting blood and that avoiding blood pays respect to God as the giver of life.

"The scene from Alice in Wonderland in Wardie Primary's assembly hall dates back to 1936 and was recently restored with a Heritage Lottery Fund.
A mother has lodged a complaint about the image describing it as racist.
Edinburgh City Council said it understands the offensiveness of the image but said it does not reflect the attitudes of the school.
An Edinburgh City Council spokesman said: ""The Alice in Wonderland mural at Wardie Primary School was painted in 1936 and is of both historical and artistic importance as evidenced by the fact it recently received full Heritage Lottery Funding support to restore the work.
""While we understand the offensiveness of the image, it is in no way indicative of the attitudes of either the school or the council.
""Our equalities policies and approaches are robustly multi-cultural and anti-racist, promoting diversity and good relationships among pupils.""
A Police Scotland spokesman said: ""Police in Edinburgh have received a complaint in relation to a mural at a primary school in the Trinity area.
""Officers are now liaising with Edinburgh City Council education department with regards to this matter.
""Police Scotland treats all reports relating to hate incidents extremely seriously and will thoroughly investigate whenever a report of this nature is made."""
"A sexual harassment complaint has been filed against New Zealand Prime Minister John Key after a waitress complained about him repeatedly pulling her ponytail at an Auckland cafe. CNN affiliate TVNZ reported that the complaint was filed Thursday morning by Graham McCready, an accountant described in the New Zealand press as a ""serial litigant,"" who has previously launched private prosecutions against Key. McCready's complaint claimed that Key had breached a section of the country's Human Rights Act relating to sexual harassment, TVNZ reported. It reported that he was seeking considerable compensation for the waitress, 26-year-old Amanda Bailey, and ""if she does not want it I ask for the money be given to Women's Refuge."" Key publicly apologized to Bailey, a waitress at his local cafe, for repeatedly tugging on her ponytail, after she complained about his behavior in a blog post. The post, published on New Zealand political website The Daily Blog, says that the odd behavior began during last year's election season. It was ""hardly an acceptable form of greeting,"" Bailey wrote. She wrote that while she didn't directly make her objections clear verbally, her body language ""screamed 'I don't like that.'"" ""As he approached me, he thought it would be fitting to raise his hands high and make scary, suspense sound effects, like the music from the movie 'Jaws',"" read the post. ""As he towered overhead I slunk down, cringing, whilst (Key's wife) Bronagh told him to 'Leave the poor girl alone.'"" The behavior carried on for a number of months and on several occasions, the post states. Eventually the cafe's manager made it clear to Key that his actions were unwelcome. Key, who regularly visits the Auckland cafe with his wife, told reporters that his behavior was in the context of ""a bit of banter,"" but said that he had apologized when it was clear she had taken offense. The blog post says that the prime minister offered the offended waitress two bottles of his own JK 2012 Pinot Noir wine by way of apology. ""We have lots of fun and games there, there's always lots of practical jokes and things. It's a very warm and friendly relationship,"" he told reporters in Los Angeles en route to ANZAC day commemorations in Gallipoli, Turkey. ""But if you look at it now, no. When I realized she took offense by that I just sort of immediately went back, gave her some wine, apologized and said I was terribly sorry."" Politicians and public figures also rounded on Key, with Green MP Metiria Turei saying that the prime minister should be held to the same standards of behavior as the rest of the electorate. ""A lot of New Zealanders know what it's like to feel as if you're not taken seriously in a job. As politicians, our job is to make people feel safe at work, not bullied,"" New Zealand media reported her as saying. ""It's a sign of how out of touch John Key has become when he can't even monitor how inappropriate his personal behavior is, and when people are not comfortable with how he is behaving."" Jackie Blue, head of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, echoed the sentiment. ""It's never OK to touch someone without their permission,"" TVNZ reported her as saying. ""There are no exceptions."" Political analyst Bryce Edwards told the network that the ""strangeness factor"" of the accusation would haunt Key. ""A lot of people will be laughing at John Key, that's harder to recover from,"" he said in a segment. The National Council of Women of New Zealand, while accepting that Key was joking and did not mean to offend, criticized the premier. ""The fact that our Prime Minister has joined the list of people outed for sexism highlights how much sexism is a part of our culture. And it starts at the top,"" the organization's chief executive Sue McCabe wrote in an open letter. ""Up and down this country, day after day, people are touched without giving their consent. At one end of the scale, it is an unwelcome pull on a ponytail. At the other end, it's our shocking levels of violence against women."""
"Per Mertesacker looks set to be ruled out of Arsenal’s derby against Chelsea although the  defender has escaped any serious ankle ligament damage. Mertesacker, captain during the long absence of Mikel Arteta, limped off during the second half of the FA Cup semi-final against Reading at Wembley on Saturday. There were fears of a serious injury for the 6ft 6in German after he twisted the joint but subsequent scans have shown it is a minor sprain. Per Mertesacker will miss Arsenal's visit by Chelsea on Sunday due to an ankle injury . The stand-in Gunners captain went down in Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final win over Reading on Saturday . He is not expected to be fit in time for Sunday, however, and likely to be replaced at centre-half by Gabriel Paulista, who has started three times in the Barclays Premier League since he was signed in January from Villarreal. Chelsea come into the match with a 10-point lead over their London rivals and will need to capitulate in spectacular fashion to not take the Premier League title. Second-placed Arsenal, on 66 points, lead Manchester United on 65 and Manchester City on 64. Scans showed the 6ft 6in German had just a minor ankle sprain when a more serious injury was feared . Mertesacker was substituted around the hour mark by Gabriel Paulista, who will deputise for him on Sunday ."
"The LAPD for searching for the person who tagged a police horse with graffiti this week - but the answer may be in the so-called 'art'. The horse, Charly, was patrolling Venice Beach with his minders on Tuesday when the vandalism incident occurred. It was broad daylight, and somehow the person managed to spray Charlie without the handlers seeing - a move that taggers pride themselves on, but usually with stationary objects and facades. 'I think it's unfortunate, but people love to tag things in Venice, so really, I guess a horse is just the next step,' local Mark Stegall told CBS LA. Vandalized: Charly was patrolling Venice Beach with with his minders Tuesday when the cruel tagger managed to write 'RBS' and an arrow on the horse's flank with silver spray paint . 'It's cruel and it's not respectful,' another local, Robert Kendall, said. 'It's bad for the animals and it's just people who want to mess with the status quo and I think it's pretty awful.' However, tags are cryptic signatures, and authorities are hoping they will be able to track down the person responsible using the tag, which was 'RBS'. A witness who saw the officer taking a picture of Charly after the incident posted their image to Instagram. All clean: The paint came off relatively easily, but police are still trying to find the person responsible . 'RBS': The key to finding the tagger likely lies in deciphering the tag, RBS, and working out who it belongs to . A witness who saw the officer taking a picture of Charly after the incident posted their image to Instagram . The paint was cleaned off Charly later on Tuesday night without a problem. However the LAPD has requested the public's help in identifying the person responsible. Anyone with information was asked to contact detectives at 310-482-6313. Anyone wishing to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (800-222-8477)."
"The pants, embroidered with the royal VR monogram, are being sold on behalf of Yesterday's World museum in Sussex.
Auctioneer Richard Edmonds said: ""We've been able to date the pants by measuring the waistband and they are from the last 10 years of her life.""
The sale also includes nightdresses and stockings worn by Britain's longest-serving monarch and Princess Alice.
The royal intimate apparel - described as in ""excellent condition"" - is expected to fetch several thousand pounds when it goes under the hammer next week.
Mr Edmonds, from Chippenham Auction Rooms, said he used the ""tried-and-tested method"" of measuring the waistline to date the underwear to about 1891.
""Earlier in her life she was slimmer but her pants got bigger as she got older,"" he said.
""As there's such a good photographic record of Queen Victoria, it's possible to calculate her waist measurement over time, so we know roughly when she would have worn items of this size.""
According to Mr Edmonds, the 125-year-old underwear was bought by Yesterday's World museum from a descendant of one of Queen Victoria's ladies-in-waiting.
""Items of Queen Victoria's clothing were often given to members of the royal household, particularly after her death in 1901,"" he said.
""And they're stamped with the royal crest which proves they're from the royal wardrobe.""
Also included in the sale on 11 July are stockings and shoes worn by Queen Victoria's third child Princess Alice and replicas of the Crown Jewels.
In 2014, a pair of Queen Victoria's silk bloomers sold at auction in Kent for Â£6,200."
"Muhanad Mahmoud al-Farekh was deported from Pakistan, where he had travelled to in about 2007.
He and two others travelled to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan from Winnipeg, Canada, where they were students.
Mr al-Farekh was born in Texas, and has been charged in New York.
He is accused of supporting a conspiracy to kill Americans and to carry out attacks against the US military.
A statement from the US Department of Justice and court documents say that Mr al-Farekh, a man named Ferid Imam, and one other unnamed individual allegedly left Canada, where they were students at the University of Manitoba, to travel to Pakistan and fight against American forces.
The justice department says that the trio did not discuss their plans with associates before leaving.
However, one of the men called a friend to tell him that he should not expect to see him again because he wished to become a martyr."
"Borussia Dortmund have moved swiftly to secure Thomas Tuchel as the successor to Jurgen Klopp, after he announced he was bringing the curtain down on his seven-year stay at the club this week. Klopp is a popular character across football but has endured a difficult season at Dortmund, with the club embroiled in a relegation battle for much of the campaign before a minor resurgence in form led them into the top half of the Bundesliga. Four days after Klopp announced he believes he has taken the club as far as he can and is seeking pastures new, Dortmund have revealed Tomas Tuchel will take over in July on a three-year deal. Thomas Tuchel (left) will replace Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp at the start of July . Klopp revealed on Wednesday he was leaving Dortmund at the end of the season after seven years . TUCHEL TREADS A SIMILAR PATH TO KLOPP . Like Klopp, the 41-year-old Tuchel carved a name for himself at German club Mainz. A year into Klopp's tenure at Dortmund, Tuchel took over at the age of 36 and surpassed the achievements of his Dortmund predecessor, taking the club to two Europa League qualifications and their highest ever Bundesliga position of 5th. Tuchel is currently seeing out the final year of his Mainz contract through a year-long break from the game . Both Tuchel (left) and Klopp have been manager of Mainz before going on to Dortmund . Upon the resolution of last season, where Mainz qualified for Europe, Tuchel announced his surprise decision to step away from his duties as manager after four years at the club. But he is still contracted to the team and when the final year of his agreement expires he will bring his year-long break from football to a close by stepping up and taking the reigns at the Westfalenstadion on July 1. HOW DOES HE PLAY? Tuchel has a reputation as a cunning tactician, who enjoys attacking football and coerces the best from his players on the coaching field. In an interview with Bundesliga.com in March this year, he defined the style he looks to enforce in his teams. 'I prefer certain qualities, an active playing style, bold defending and pacy play in attack,' Tuchel said. 'There’s definitely a style that’s been attributed to me, that we brought to the table at Mainz.' GUARDIOLA ADMIRATION . In the same interview, Tuchel commended the work and achievements of Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola, the man he will now look to lock horns with as Dortmund manager. Tuchel has spoken of his admiration of Pep Guardiola's management of Barcelona and Lionel Messi . Tuchel praised Guardiola's management of Lionel Messi during his time at Barcelona and lauded his renowned meticulous approach. 'Outstanding, schematic use of the ball, brilliant individuals like Lionel Messi and top stars putting in the grittiest, most diligent defensive efforts I've ever seen,' Tuchel gushed of Pep's Barca. 'I learned everything about the game - especially during Guardiola's time at Barcelona.' TUCHEL LINKED WITH NEWCASTLE . The German manager was strongly linked with Newcastle in January after the Premier League club tried to establish their plan following the departure of Alan Pardew to Crystal Palace. But no move ever materialised, most likely because of the delicate nature of the deal that is still in place with Mainz. Tuchel admitted that Spanish and English football is of interest to him but he wanted to return to management in Germany. HERMANN BADSTUBER AN INFLUENCE . Tuchel lists Hermann Badstuber, a youth coach at Stuttgart and the father of Bayern Munich defender Holger Badstuber, as his biggest influence as a coach. In an interview with Spox.com in September 2009, six months after Badstuber's death from cancer, Tuchel revealed how much he had shaped his coaching philosophy. Tuchel has a reputation for enforcing an attacking approach to his team's style of play . Tuchel was linked with the manager vacancy at Newcastle United shortly after Alan Pardew left . 'I barely know any coach who brings so much knowledge in itself and at the same time allows as much lateral thinking and constantly questions,' Tuchel said. 'He worked diligently and thereby remained modest. He  very, very much influenced me professionally and personally.' Tuchel and Badstuber crossed paths at Stuttgart, where they worked training youth sides, following Tuchel's retirement as a player at SSV Ulm due to a persistent knee injury when he was 24."
"In a statement (in French) it said it was ""worried about the continued worsening of the situation"".
On Saturday, Turkey began shelling the militia, which it says is linked to the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
The fighters, the YPG militia based in Syria, have rejected Turkey's demand to leave areas it has seized, saying Islamists would return if it left.
Turkey's assault is a new thread in an already-complex conflict that has drawn in competing regional powers.
Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu insisted on Sunday that Turkey ""will not permit the [Kurdish militia] to carry out aggressive acts"".
""Our security forces gave the necessary response and will continue to do so,"" Mr Davutoglu said.
Syria has also condemned the Turkish action as a violation of its sovereignty and asked the UN Security Council to intervene.
France also called on the Syrian regime and its allies to stop their bombardments ""across the whole of the country"".
France said priority should be given to implementing an agreement reached in Munich this week on ceasing hostilities, and the fight against so-called Islamic State (IS) group.
Almost five years of civil war in Syria have led to the deaths of more than 250,000 people. More than 11 million people have been displaced.

Syria: The story of the conflict
Turkey v Islamic State v the Kurds: What's going on?
Attempts to broker a peace deal have repeatedly failed, but on Thursday, world leaders agreed to work towards a so-called cessation of hostilities in Syria within a week.
The US and Russian presidents agreed in a ""frank and business-like"" phone call to work more closely to achieve this, the Kremlin said on Sunday.
Russia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has been carrying out air strikes since September against what it terms ""terrorists"".
Among the targets shelled by Turkey is the Menagh airbase, which was seized by the YPG on Thursday from Syrian Islamist rebels. The YPG controls much of Syria's northern border with Turkey.
Syria's war hardly needs a new front, but another has now opened up.
Ankara sees the Kurdish PYD party and its YPG militia as terrorist organisations. It's worried that weapons are seeping over the border from Syria to the PKK, with which Turkey has renewed its armed conflict since a ceasefire broke down last year.
Washington rejects Ankara's view that the PYD is a terrorist organisation, seeing it instead as an effective ally against so-called Islamic State (IS). That has caused rifts between the two Nato allies and is hampering international peace talks.
Syria is the stage for several proxy wars, and Turkey has just started another, going after its Kurdish nemesis there and vowing to stop the PYD from cementing control of northern Syria.
Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency said Turkish forces shot at Kurdish fighters inside Syria on Sunday after coming under fire themselves.
Ankara sees the group as being linked with Kurdish guerrillas from PKK, which has waged a campaign against security forces in Turkey for decades.
In other developments:
Under the agreed cessation of hostilities plan, efforts will be made to try to make urgent aid deliveries to besieged and hard-to-reach areas in Syria.
Steps will also be taken to work towards an eventual ceasefire and implementation of a UN-backed plan for political transition in Syria.
The halt would not apply to the battle against the jihadists of IS and al-Nusra Front.
However, neither the Syrian government nor the rebels were involved in the deal and both have since vowed to continue fighting.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said on Friday that he intended to retake ""the whole country"" from rebels - a statement the US government said was ""deluded"".
Syrian government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, have almost encircled rebels in parts of the northern city of Aleppo.
Also on Sunday, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev repeated a warning that any foreign ground operation in Syria would lead to ""a full-fledged, long war"".
Turkey has said its troops and forces from Saudi Arabia might participate in a ground operation against IS."
"The two-and-a-half minute clip - which sees Daniel Craig reprise his role as the superspy for a fourth time - gives a closer look at the film after a teaser was released in March.
Featuring car chases, exploding planes and shady crime organisations, it bares all the hallmarks of classic Bond.
Spectre will be released in UK cinemas on 26 October.
The new trailer begins with a first look at Ralph Fiennes in his new role as MI6 boss M, questioning Bond about a rogue mission to Mexico City.
The spy is then seen in Rome, where he meets Lucia Sciarra - played by Monica Bellucci - the widow of an infamous criminal.
After a suggested quick tryst with Sciarra, Bond infiltrates a secret meeting and uncovers the existence of the crime organisation known as Spectre.
Having previously only seen him as a shadowy character in the teaser clip, Christoph Waltz is also finally revealed as Bond villain Franz Oberhauser.
There is also a first glimpse of Sherlock star Andrew Scott, who stars as Max Denbigh, the new head of the Centre for National Security.
Fans on Twitter were quick to give their reaction to the new trailer and many noted it featured some of the theme to 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service.
""This looks absolutely stunning!"" Ben Peyton wrote, while Rene Friedrich said it was ""so much better than the teaser. Finally, how it should be: a blend of iconic, new, fast, quotable"".
However, Dekan Apajee said: ""As trailers go this is more of a spoiler."""

He said: ""I think I don't respect the sport enough. You know, I'm going to play another 10 years, and I know after my career I won't have to work again.""
Tomic, who has won three ATP Tour titles, has earned almost £4m in career prize money, including £35,000 for his defeat by Zverev.
When asked in his post-match news conference if he should repay the money from his limp defeat, he replied: ""We all work for money. At 34, maybe I can donate to charity. If you ask Roger Federer if he'll do it, I'll do it.""

"David Letterman stunned his Late Show audience into silence with a joke branded 'disrespectful to women' David Letterman stunned his Late Show audience into silence with a joke which has been branded as 'disrespectful to women'. The veteran host was attempting to warm up the studio audience ahead of his show on Monday when he made the off-colour gag. Letterman had just opened up questions to the floor, and fielded the first query of the night from a college employee, reported the New York Post. They asked what advice the scandal-hit comic would give to this year's graduates. Letterman, who was in 2009 forced to admit to string of affairs, said: 'Treat a lady like a wh–e, and a wh–e like a lady.' But the joke received a frosty reception from the shocked crowd. After being met with stunned silence, the host attempted to recover by offering further advice to graduates to 'eat salad' and 'always be nice'. However, several audience members at the Ed Sullivan Theater were furious over the sexist joke. Retired Jerry Stockton, from Virginia, called it 'disrespectful to women' while another, who would not be named, said it had been an 'odd choice' for the first joke of the evening. The gag is thought to have been a reference to a saying by 1930s screenwriter Wilson Mizner. Scroll down for video . Joe Logan, 41, from Pennsylvania, told the New York Post: 'Younger people watch his show. We already live in a culture that objectifies women, it's not right to make a joke like that.' A Letterman spokesman said he could not 'confirm the accuracy' of Monday's failed joke and would not comment further. But a source close to the show insisted 'It got a big laugh.' Letterman carried on with the show which had guests including John Travolta and Amy Schumer, star of her eponymous Comedy Central show, 'Inside Amy Schumer.' Old friends: David thanked John for being his friend over the decades during Monday's show. It was during a Monday warm up that he made the gag . The Grease actor, 61, had tried to bring his son Ben on to meet his 'old friend' Letterman but the nervous youngster had fled the stage into his mother's arms. The host later offered some advice to Schumer and instructed her to 'do something now that you'll regret.' So the comedienne immediately lifted her dress and flashed... her surfing scar to a relieved-looking Letterman. In October 2009, the veteran host of the Late Show had been forced to admit to a string of affairs live on air  by a blackmailing producer. The host made the shocking revelation on his show that he had cheated on his wife, Regina Lasko, whom he had only married that March. He made the confession after becoming the victim of an extortion plot concocted by a then-CBS producer, Robert Halderman, who demanded $2 million in exchange for his silence over the affairs. Letterman is now planning to retire from the show after more than 20 years of hosting on May 20. Good times: David rubbed his forehead while Amy cracked up after he told her to do something she'd regret ."
"The man was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to intercept voicemail messages and attempting to pervert the course of justice.
The arrest took place by appointment at a north London police station; the man is in police custody.
He has been bailed to a date in mid January 2012.
He was arrested by officers from Scotland Yard's fresh investigation into phone hacking, Operation Weeting.
On Tuesday, a 71-year-old Stuart Kuttner, an ex-News of the World managing editor, was rearrested and bailed as part of the phone-hacking probe.
Mr Kuttner was originally arrested on 2 August on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications and corruption, and bailed.
He has now been bailed to a date in September, the Metropolitan Police said.
The Met's Operation Weeting is investigating illegal hacking of the mobile phone voicemails of public figures by the now-defunct News of the World newspaper.
The latest arrest is the 15th to be made on suspicion of phone hacking since Operation Weeting was launched in January. It happened just after midday.
BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said the age of the arrested person suggested someone more junior compared to some of the more senior executives who have been arrested by the police so far.
It is a long-running investigation and there would almost certainly be further arrests, our correspondent added.
Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and ex-Downing Street communications chief Andy Coulson are among those who have already been arrested as part of the inquiry.
The scandal has led Met Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson and Assistant Commissioner John Yates to resign, and the News of the World to close down after 168 years."
"In December 2015, he said Mr Trump was ""out of his mind"" for suggesting a ban on Muslims entering the US.
Mr Johnson also attacked the Republican for his claim that police were afraid to patrol parts of London, fearing attacks by religious extremists.
The former mayor of London said of Mr Trump's hometown: ""The only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump.""
But as we leap forward to November 2016, and Mr Johnson's words of welcome for a ""positive"" Trump presidency, it's time to take a look back at some of the other occasions Boris Johnson has changed his mind.
After the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, took legal action against German satirist Jan Boehmermann for performing a poem insulting to the Turkish premier, Boris Johnson wrote a poem of his own.
The limerick - the key parts of which we cannot reprint here - won the Spectator magazine's ""President Erdogan Offensive Poetry Competition"" in May.
More significantly, though, Mr Johnson has several times changed his public stance on whether or not Turkey should join the EU.
During the referendum campaign, he repeatedly warned voters about the prospect of Turkey joining the EU - and the impact migration from the country could have on the UK. That was despite the fact he had previously said keeping Turkey out of the bloc ""sent out the worst possible message to moderates in the Islamic world"".
Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told the BBC at the time: ""May God help him and reform him.""
Since the referendum, however, Mr Johnson has changed his tone again.
In September 2016, he visited Turkey in search of a ""jumbo trade deal"". During the trip, he called for ""a new partnership"" between the UK and Turkey, extolling the virtues of his ""beautiful, very well functioning"" Turkish washing machine.
He also said the UK would ""help Turkey in any way"" with its bid to join the EU.
The relationship between the outgoing US president and Boris Johnson has had its ups and downs.
In 2008, Mr Johnson supported the then US senator's bid to become the first black American president, saying: ""If Barack Obama can do it, it will be the most fantastic boost, I think, for black people everywhere around the world.""
This changed when President Obama came out in favour of Britain remaining a member of the EU, and said the UK would be at ""the back of the queue"" to make trade deals with the US if it voted Leave.
Reacting in an opinion piece for the Sun in April, Mr Johnson said the ""part-Kenyan President"" suffered from an ""ancestral dislike of the British empire"" that had led him to remove a bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office.
The comments were branded ""idiotic"" and ""deeply offensive"" by Churchill's grandson, Sir Nicholas Soames.
In a December 2015 column, Mr Johnson wrote that Russian President Vladimir Putin was a ""ruthless and manipulative tyrant"" who looked ""a bit like Dobby the House Elf"" from Harry Potter.
But in August, the foreign secretary called for the UK to ""normalise"" relations with Russia.
A Foreign Office official said Boris Johnson felt ""we need to continue to build a constructive dialogue on issues of mutual concern as well as on points of disagreement"".
Mr Johnson also praised the Russian president for assisting in the liberation of Palmyra in Syria, saying Russian troops had driven the so-called Islamic State group from the archaeologically significant site ""with a ruthless clarity"" that ""made the West look ineffective"".
As well as his comments about Barack Obama, Mr Johnson once branded Hillary Clinton a ""sadistic nurse in a mental hospital"".
But when he stood alongside Secretary of State John Kerry at a July 2016 press conference, his US counterpart defended him, saying he had been told the foreign secretary was a ""very smart and capable man"".
A relieved Mr Johnson said ""Phew - let's stop there."" But a grinning Mr Kerry nudged his less-experienced colleague, saying: ""It's called diplomacy, Boris.""
China, 2008: ""Ping-pong was invented on the dining tables of England in the 19th Century, and it was called Wiff-waff. And there, I think, you have the difference between us and the rest of the world. Other nations, the French, looked at a dining table and saw an opportunity to have dinner; we looked at it and saw an opportunity to play Wiff-waff. And I say to the Chinese, and to the world, that ping-pong is coming home.""
Papua New Guinea, 2006: ""For 10 years, we in the Tory party have become used to Papua New Guinea-style orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing, and so it is with a happy amazement that we watch as the madness engulfs the Labour Party.""
Uganda, 2002: ""If left to their own devices, the natives would rely on nothing but the instant carbohydrate gratification of the plantain."""
"The father of an asthmatic nursing student who died during a traffic stop is threatening to sue police.

Nursing student Anthony Clark Reed (left and right) was driving around Detroit, Michigan, on Monday night when he was pulled over. He suffered a heart attack during a traffic stop after complaining he had trouble breathing . His father, pastor Kevin Clark, claimed his son had been 'driving erratically' because he was having trouble breathing and was searching for his inhaler. He told The Huffington Post that he suffered an asthma attack, and the police were indirectly responsible for his death. 'He was gasping for air, looking for his inhaler [as he was driving],' Clark told the site. 'When Detroit police pulled him out of the car he was already in panic mode … and they handcuffed him, and he's trying to tell them he can't breathe. 'I believe it caused his death ... He dropped dead right there, in the hands of Detroit police officers who were negligent.' He described how he found out about his son's death two hours after the incident. When he arrived at the hospital, he claims no one from Detroit Police was there to tell him what happened.

It wasn't until the next morning that he was able to speak to officers. Spokeswoman June West said: 'We provided him with answers as best we could at this stage of the investigation and we will be reaching out to the family in the next few days to provide them with updated information as it becomes available.' Jennifer Moreno from the Detroit Police media relations department told MILive: 'Officers did stop the gentleman for a traffic violation and subsequently he exited the vehicle ... had an asthma attack. 'They gave him his inhaler (and) they administered CPR when the gentleman passed out and then (an ambulance) was ordered ...' The coroner's office have yet to determine the cause of death.

"Remember the Tuskegee syphilis experiment from the 1930s? Scientists studied poor African-Americans in Alabama who'd contracted the venereal disease but didn't tell them they had the disease or do anything to cure them. A lawsuit filed this week alleges Johns Hopkins University and the Rockefeller Foundation helped conduct a similar study in Guatemala from 1945 to 1956. Orphans, inmates, psychiatric patients and prostitutes were deliberately infected with sexually transmitted diseases to determine what drugs, including penicillin, worked best in stopping the diseases, the lawsuit says. The subjects of the experiments weren't told they'd been infected, the lawsuit says, causing some to die and others to pass the disease to their spouses, sexual partners and children. The suit seeks more than $1 billion in damages and has 774 plaintiffs, including people who were subjects in the experiments and their descendants. This is the second attempt to collect damages. In 2012, a class-action federal lawsuit was filed against the U.S. government over the Guatemala experiments conducted by the U.S. Public Health Service. A judge dismissed it, saying the Guatemalans could not sue the United States for grievances that happened overseas. The new lawsuit was filed in the Baltimore City Circuit Court. Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller Foundation filed statements on their websites condemning the experiments, but denying responsibility. ""The plaintiffs' essential claim in this case is that prominent Johns Hopkins faculty members' participation on a government committee that reviewed funding applications was tantamount to conducting the research itself and that therefore Johns Hopkins should be held liable,"" the Johns Hopkins statement said. ""Neither assertion is true."" The lawsuit alleges the Rockefeller Foundation funded Johns Hopkins' research into public health issues, including venereal disease, and employed scientists who monitored the Guatemala experiments. The lawsuit, the Rockefeller Foundation statement said, ""seeks improperly to assign 'guilt by association' in the absence of compensation from the United States federal government."" The suit says Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller Foundation designed, supported and benefited from the Guatemala experiments. Bristol-Myers Squibb pharmaceutical group and that company's owner, Mead Johnson, also are defendants. The pharmaceutical company supplied drugs for the experiments, the suit says. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers Squibb sent this statement to CNN: ""We've only just received the complaint in this matter. Bristol-Myers Squibb played an important role in the development of penicillin in the past and today we continue to focus our work on developing breakthrough medicines for serious disease. As a company dedicated to patients, we take this matter very seriously and are reviewing the allegations."" Nobody doubts the experiments happened. In 2010, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton apologized to Guatemala for the experiments, saying they were ""clearly unethical."" In the 1930s and 1940s, the government followed a policy of funding scientific medical research but not controlling individual doctors, the suit says. The lawsuit says John Hopkins controlled and influenced the appointed panels that authorized funding for research into venereal disease. The lawsuit says prostitutes were infected to intentionally spread the disease and that syphilis spirochetes were injected into the spinal fluid of subjects. A woman in a psychiatric hospital had gonorrhea pus from a male subject injected into both her eyes, the suit says. The lawsuit doesn't say why the experiments ended. The results were never published and were not revealed until 2011, when the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues wrote a letter to President Barack Obama telling of its investigation, the suit says. CNN's Deanna Hackney contributed to this report."
"A BBC crew recorded a party member remarking at a meeting that Golden Dawn members had not beaten radical left MP Dimitris Stratoulis hard enough.
The party sued Mr Stratoulis when he accused them over the attack.
Contacted by the BBC, a party spokesperson dismissed the remarks at the meeting as a ""joke"".
Greek police spokesman Lt Col Christos Manouras told the BBC on Monday that as soon as police heard the BBC broadcast, they recorded the clip of the Golden Dawn meeting and sent it to the office investigating the alleged attack on Mr Stratoulis.
The MP from the Syriza bloc was reportedly attacked after a football match in the Olympic Stadium on 16 December by three men who, he says, threatened to kill him. He is said to have suffered light injuries.
Golden Dawn is one of the most right-wing parties in Europe and its anti-immigrant language and logo, redolent of a swastika, underline why many call it neo-Nazi, the BBC's Tim Franks reports from Athens.
A recent opinion poll suggests the party's support has grown since the last election, when it won 18 seats in parliament.

"The superhero had been declared an honorary ambassador to promote messages about women's empowerment and gender-based violence.

A petition against the selection gathered nearly 45,000 signatures.
The UN did not explain why the project with Wonder Woman, announced in October, would end on Friday.
But spokesman Jeffrey Brez said campaigns using fictional characters often lasted no longer than a few months, Reuters news agency reported.
DC Entertainment, which publishes DC Comics, said it was pleased with the exposure Wonder Woman had brought to the cause.
Warner Bros and DC Entertainment are supporting a year-long campaign by the UN and its children's agency, Unicef, for gender equality and women's empowerment.
In the petition against the character's appointment, opponents said the image she projected was ""not culturally encompassing or sensitive"".
""It is alarming that the United Nations would consider using a character with an overtly sexualised image at a time when the headline news in United States and the world is the objectification of women and girls,"" it said.
Wonder Woman - an Amazonian from the all-female paradise of Themyscira - masquerades as Diana Prince, whose occupations include an army nurse, until her services are called on by a society in peril.
She first came to the public's attention in October 1941, and was most famously played by actress Lynda Carter in the hit US TV series that ran from 1975-79.
The announcement came as the UN itself was under criticism for having a lack of gender parity in senior roles.
Despite campaigns there has never been a female secretary general and one analysis found that in 2015 nine of 10 senior leadership jobs went to men."
"There is an insufficient supply of whooping cough vaccine in Australia, according to Queensland Health. However, medical professionals insist the resource shortage will not affect the immunisation programs for babies, children and pregnant women. It comes less than a month after the death of 32-day-old Riley who died after contracting whooping cough. His parents Catherine and Greg are now leading a campaign, urging adults to vaccinate themselves and their children to prevent more infant deaths from the terrible disease. The adult whooping cough vaccine will not be available in Australia until July, according to ABC News. However, although whooping cough is less severe in adults, infected adults do pose a serious risk for infants and children who are not vaccinated. Scroll down for video . Riley Hughes died at just 32 days old after suffering complications arising from whooping cough . Two days before Riley died his mother posted a photo of him wrapped in a blanket in hospital . 'Heartbreaking to watch 4 week old Riley struggle,' Catherine Hughes wrote as she urged people to get themselves immunised . Riley's father Greg also posted a touching tribute on Facebook to his 'darling little angel Riley' 'The one product that is in short supply is not part of the formal national immunisation program, but is a booster dose that's used generally by GPs for adults,' Queensland Health senior medical officer Dr Alun Richards told ABC News. 'We have sufficient stocks to vaccinate children as part of the school-based vaccination program.' On March 15, two days before baby Riley died, his mother Catherine posted a devastating photo of her son wrapped up in a blanket in his hospital bed urging people to get themselves and their children immunised against whooping cough. 'If you haven't been immunised against whooping cough (pertussis) please consider getting it done. 'Heartbreaking to watch 4 week old Riley struggle with it at (Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital). Please keep him in your thoughts!,' she wrote. 'If you're anti-immunisation/anti-logic/anti-duty of care to your society as a whole, then feel free to take a look at this picture of my son in hospital right now at 4 weeks old with whooping cough - and then come and tell me how you think immunisation is a bad thing,' Riley's father Greg added. Dr Richards could not confirm why the shortage has taken place but told ABC that it is not abnormal. His mother Catherine Hughes posted a brave tribute to her baby boy and thanked Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital for doing 'everything they could to save his little life' 'I don't know whether it's because of increased demand in the world or if it's another issue, but there are vaccination shortages from time to time,' he said. 'There are other preparations on the market [and] they're not all in short supply.' For people opting to be vaccinated against whooping cough, they may be deferred by their GP until more supplies are available. 'These people can return when supplies are again available,' Dr Jeannette Young told ABC News. Infectious Diseases Expert at ANU Medical School Canberra, Sanjaya Senanayake, told Daily Mail Australia: 'From my point of view immunisation is wonderful particularly for whooping cough.' He explained infants are 'at a high risk of dying if they get infected' and that the death rate from whooping cough in infants under 6 months of age is about 1 per cent. 'It's important to listen to the experts,' Mr Senanayake said. 'Whooping cough is lethal in babies and in adults people can be absent from work for the persistent cough, it's a nasty infection.' Whooping cough (also known as 'pertussis') is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways. The government health website says the disease is 'highly infectious and most serious in babies under the age of 12 months'. Babies are at greatest risk of infection until they can have at least two doses of the vaccine (minimum 4 months old) as the mother's antibodies do not provide reliable protection. It's very rare for children who have been immunised against whooping cough to get the disease – and if they do, it's usually not as serious. Symptoms . The condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough that progresses to intense bouts of coughing. These are followed by a distinctive 'whooping' noise, which is how the condition gets its name. The early symptoms of whooping cough are often similar to those of a common cold and may include: . These early symptoms of whooping cough can last for one to two weeks, before becoming more severe. The second stage of whooping cough is often called the paroxysmal stage and is characterised by intense bouts of coughing. Each bout of coughing usually lasts between one and two minutes. Infants younger than six months may not make the 'whoop' sound after coughing, but they may start gagging or gasping, and may temporarily stop breathing. Information supplied by HealthDirect.gov.au . In 2013, the Department of Health report said that despite a long-standing immunisation program, 'pertussis remains highly prevalent in Australia and the least well controlled of all vaccine-preventable diseases'. 'Epidemics occur every 3 to 4 years. In unvaccinated populations, these outbreaks can be very large. In vaccinated populations, outbreaks are smaller, with greatly reduced mortality and morbidity, and may continue to occur every 3 to 4 years or be more widely spaced,' the report said. The devastated parents have set up a Facebook page that already has over 25,000 likes ."
"A 63-year-old former air hostess has won a £14.5m London mansion from her 'immensely wealthy' 90-year-old Saudi Arabian ex-husband following a legal battle based on a Victorian law. The property, in north west London, which has 'superb views' over a London park, was one of five properties which the successful property developer bought during the couple's 14-year marriage. The couple's main marital home had been a £26m 'palatial residence' in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for which 40 members of staff were employed to keep it ticking over. A 63-year-old former air hostess has won a £14.5m London mansion from her 'immensely wealthy' 90-year-old Saudi Arabian ex-husband following a legal battle at the High Court (pictured) But, after their divorce, the woman - who did not have any financial input into the properties - moved into the townhouse, claiming her right to live there as one of their matrimonial homes. Despite her husband's attempts to evict her from the home, and force the sale of the heavily-mortgaged property, the wife has now been allowed to keep it as part of a complex legal settlement. The 'opulent' maisonette - which was originally three flats converted into one large home - was at one point worth £22m, but is now worth a 'disappointing' £14.5m, the court heard. The husband, who is said to be worth £600m and  blows up to £10m per year, was also made to give his wife their 'holiday' property in Cannes, which is worth 17m Euros. The judgment, made at the high court, was based on the woman's claim to a right to marital property under the 1882 Married Women’s Property Act. The judge ruled that she should be awarded around £10m on a 'needs light' basis. That was based on £3.5m for London housing, £2.25 million for a replacement holiday home and a further £500,000 to cover the outgoings on both properties. The court heard that both homes had significant mortgages, meaning they would have respective equities of £3.5m and £5.2m if they are sold. But the judge refused to grant the woman the £205,014 she was seeking annually to spend on jewellery, handbags and cars. The woman had claimed she needed £566,045 per year for her £75,000 wardrobe, as well as £25,000 to spend on jewellery. She also needed £25,000 for shoes and another £25,000 for handbags and accessories, she claimed. The couple married in the Central London Mosque (pictured) in 1979 when the man, a property developer, was in his mid-50s and the woman was in her late 20s. They divorced twice, once in 2002 and once in 2013 . The judge recognised that the woman's standard of living had been  'lavish and exceptional' during the marriage but said that it was 'not reasonable' to expect that to continue. He added: 'If the wife exceeds this figure, she will have only herself to blame.' The judge also pointed out that, had it been an entirely English case, the woman would have been entitled to £44million - the figure she originally sought - out of total £287.5million in assets. He said that even though she was 'clearly not a lady of business', she was the homemaker and mother, which made her contribution to the marriage equal to her husband. 'The authorities make it clear that she is not to be discriminated against for the way in which the parties organised their respective roles,' he said. The woman, from Lebanon, took the legal action against the businessman at the High Court in London. Had the same case been heard in Saudi Arabia, the woman would have been entitled to all but nothing. The couple married at the Central London Mosque in 1979 when the man was in his mid 50s and the woman was in her late 20s. They divorced in 1999, before remarrying in 2002. They then separated again in 2013, before divorcing in Saudi Arabia. The court heard that the main marital home had been in Saudi Arabia, where her rights would have been very different. But she was allowed to bring the case in London because the family had spent most summers during their marriage in the capital to escape the 'intolerable' Saudi Arabian heat, making it one of their matrimonial homes. Their children had also gone to nursery here during the holidays and the woman had lived here for at least one year when the case was brought. The court heard the husband owned properties in Paris, which sold for 15million Euros in 2013, and Beirut, which sold for $15.5m. His wife had kept the profit from the Paris flat, he said. Details of the case emerged in a ruling by Mr Justice Moor following a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in November. The row broke out when the pair were reunited in 2002, with the wife alleging that her husband had promised to transfer her some of his properties. The court heard that the husband, said to be a member of several London clubs, had indeed transferred different properties to other members of his family, including his wife. But the judge rejected the claim that he would have promised to transfer his wife any properties for any other reason than tax, insisting he was still the 'beneficial owner' of the property. He said: 'It is inherently improbable. He is a Saudi businessman with great stature. I cannot conceive that he would willingly part with all his residential property. Why should he? He had no intention of losing control of his various residential properties.' The judge also found that the wife had 'embellished and altered her recollection to suit her case'. The Married Women's Property Act 1882 was an act that significantly altered English law regarding the property rights of married women. Among the laws it introduced, it allowed married women to own and control property in their own right. It came following an 1836 Caroline Norton court case which highlighted the injustice of English property laws, and generated enough support that eventually resulted in the Married Women’s Property Act. Many of the elements have since been superseded by subsequent family law statutes."
"Dubbed ""carbon farming"", researchers say the idea is economically competitive with high-tech carbon capture and storage projects.
But critics say the idea could be have unforeseen, negative impacts including driving up food prices.
The research has been published in the journal Earth System Dynamics.
Jatropha curcas is a plant that originated in Central America and is very well adapted to harsh conditions including extremely arid deserts.
It is already grown as a biofuel in some parts of the world because its seeds can produce oil.
In this study, German scientists showed that one hectare of jatropha could capture up to 25 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year. The researchers based their estimates on trees currently growing in trial plots in Egypt and in the Negev desert.
""The results are overwhelming,"" said Prof Klaus Becker, from the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart.
""There was good growth, a good response from these plants. I feel there will be no problem trying it on a much larger scale, for example ten thousand hectares in the beginning,"" he said.
According to the researchers a plantation that would cover three percent of the Arabian desert would absorb all the CO2 produced by cars and trucks in Germany over a 20 year period.
The scientists say that a critical element of the plan would be the availability of desalination facilities. This means that initially, any plantations would be confined to coastal areas.
They are hoping to develop larger trials in desert areas of Oman or Qatar. Prof Becker says that unlike other schemes that just offset the carbon that people produce, the planting of jatropha could be a good,  short term solution to climate change.
""I think it is a good idea because we are really extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - and it is completely different between extracting and preventing.""
According to the scientist's calculations the costs of curbing carbon dioxide via the planting of trees would be between 42 and 63 euros per tonne. This makes it competitive with other techniques, such as the more high tech carbon capture and storage (CCS).
A number of countries are currently trialling this technology but it has yet to be deployed commercially.
Growing jatropha not only soaks up CO2 but has other benefits. The plants would help to make desert areas more habitable, and the plant's seeds can be harvested for biofuel say the researchers, providing an economic return.
""Jatropha is ideal to be turned into biokerosene - it is even better than biodiesel,"" said Prof Becker.
But other experts in this area are not convinced. They point to the fact that in 2007 and 2008 large numbers of jatropha trees were planted for biofuel, especially in Africa. But many of these ventures ended in tears, as the plants were not very successful in coping with dry conditions.
Lucy Hurn is the biofuels campaign manager for the charity, Actionaid. She says that while jatropha was once seen as the great, green hope the reality was very different.
""When jatropha was introduced it was seen as a miracle crop, it would grow on scrubland or marginal land,"" she said.
""But there are often people who need marginal land to graze their animals, they are getting food from that area - we wouldn't class the land as marginal.""
She pointed out that jatropha is highly toxic and can pollute the land it is grown on, even in a desert. And she also had concerns about the fairness of the idea.
""It is still somebody else's land. Why go in and grow these massive plantations to deal with a problem these people didn't actually cause?""

"Real Housewives Of New Jersey star Joe Giudice has had his driving license suspended for two years by a state judge who called his driving record the worst he's ever seen. Giudice, who is preparing to head to federal prison for bankruptcy fraud, lost his driver's license and was fined the maximum of $10,000. He pleaded guilty in October to unlawful use of an ID and impersonation. His guilty plea included an 18-month sentence. Scroll down for more . Real Housewives Of New Jersey star Joe Giudice has had his driving license suspended for two years by a state judge who called his driving record the worst he's ever seen . That will run concurrent with his 41-month federal sentence for bankruptcy fraud and failing to file taxes. His wife, Teresa, is serving a 15-month federal sentence on the fraud charges. He will begin his sentence when hers is over. Superior Court Judge Adam Jacobs said Joe Giudice has a 'general disrespect for the law,' citing dozens of previous driving infractions and suspensions. He said he came close to rejecting the plea deal with prosecutors but wanted to follow a federal judge's intention to allow Giudice to remain free while Teresa is in jail so he can care for their four daughters. The judge permitted Giudice to drive home from court but said he would be sent to jail immediately if he drove again after that. Jacobs said: 'If you so much as back down your driveway... that will constitute a violation of the conditions of your release, of your bail, and it will result in you being remanded immediately to Passaic County Jail,' Joe's lawyer tried to argue that he is 'destitute' and unable to pay the hefty fine. Giudice's lawyer tried to argue that his client is 'destitute' and unable to pay the hefty $10,000 fine, but after the reality star recently got paid $75,000 for prison photos alongside his wife Teresa, the judge refused . Tough times: The 42-year-old will serve 18-months in prison which will run concurrently to the 41-months he was sentenced to last year on separate charges for bankruptcy fraud. He is pictured with Teresa and their four daughters on January 4 before she started her 15-month sentence . But after his less than transparent financial history and recently getting paid $75,000 for prison photos alongside his wife Teresa and a tell-all interview, the judge refused to lower the fine. Prosecutors in Passaic County said Giudice used his brother's identity to obtain a driver's license while his own was suspended for driving while intoxicated in 2010. The Giudices pleaded guilty in the federal case in March 2014, admitting they hid assets from bankruptcy creditors and submitted phony loan applications to get some $5 million in mortgages and construction loans. Joe Giudice also pleaded guilty to failing to pay taxes totaling more than $200,000. The couple also was ordered to pay restitution of more than $400,000. Joe Giudice is an Italian citizen by birth who never became a U.S. citizen. He is expected to be deported once his prison term ends."

Hernandez and Ronaldo combined for Real Madrid's winner against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night, with the former only on loan and deemed surplus to requirements by Louis van Gaal who has instead relied on misfiring Radamel Falcao. Meanwhile, Tevez was leading the line for Juventus, with Evra at left back, in their 0-0 draw against Monaco that won a place in the last four. Pogba is out with a thigh injury but could return in the time for the semi-finals next month. Finally, Pique is enjoying one of the best seasons of his career at centre back for Barcelona and helped keep out Paris Saint-Germain's fearsome attack that featured Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani on Tuesday night. Cristiano Ronaldo has gone from strength to strength since leaving United and is in the last four once again . Carlos Tevez went to Manchester City between his stints with United and Juventus, who beat Monaco . Whatever happens in the semi-finals, there will be at least one former Old Trafford representative at the Champions League final in Berlin's Olympic Stadium on May 6. United are on course for a return to Europe's top table next season, with their position inside the Barclays Premier League's top four looking fairly safe ahead of Liverpool who sit eight points behind. But for now, the Champions League semi-finals are the home of their former players, rather than their current ones. Gerard Pique spent time at United between two spells with Barcelona, and he is in the semi-finals with them . Paul Pogba was released by the Old Trafford club after spending his youth there and plays for Juve now ."
"The charity said there had been a total of 137 convictions in the same period.
The maximum sentence for offenders is six months in prison and/or an unlimited fine, but campaigners want it to be raised to up to three years.
Brian Wheelhouse, who runs a dog rescue centre, said offenders only cared about financial gain and not about the dog.
Eduardo Goncalves, chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: ""Evidence from the UK and abroad points to the activity being a 'gateway' crime to serious and organised offences, such as drug and gun crime.
""In the United States dog fighting is recognised as a Grade A felony by the FBI.""
France applies a sentence of up to two years, and Germany and the Czech Republic apply a sentence of up to three years.
The RSPCA said the highest number of calls it had received had been in Greater London (924), followed by the West Midlands (469), West Yorkshire (305) and Greater Manchester (238).
Rural counties are also affected, including the areas of Kent, Essex and Lancashire.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said there were ""strict laws in place"" to deal with people who were not properly looking after animals.
A spokesman said: ""Anyone who is cruel to an animal or does not provide for its welfare needs may be banned from owning animals, given an unlimited fine or sent to prison.""
Campaigners including the League Against Cruel Sports, the RSPCA and the Dogs Trust, along with the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) have all called for tougher sentencing as a deterrent.
Deputy Chief Constable Gareth Pritchard, the NPCC's lead for dangerous dogs, said ""this kind of animal abuse"" caused ""untold distress and harm to the animals involved"".
We had a call from the dog compound. There was concern because this dog had obviously been used for dog fighting, or as dog bait, with the injuries it had sustained.
A dog that attacks another dog will go for the jugular vein - for the neck - so Benji has got injuries all around his neck, [and] around his face.
Dog fighting is done by individuals that are fighting them for financial gain.
They're not bothered what happens to the dog at the end of the day as long as it wins.
They're not bothered about the injuries because they're not going to be taking it to the vets and having it treated.
They'll leave it to heal up by itself. If the dog dies then so be it.
To inflict injuries and do horrible things on these poor creatures just beggar's belief.
Last year, two kittens were found in Bradford with their fur coloured using marker pens.
It is thought they were to have been used as bait in a dog fight, where people would have bet on which one would have died first.
They came in through a police officer who'd been to a property and seized them.
We'd never seen anything quite like it before - one was coloured blue with a marker pen, and one was green.
Thankfully nothing terrible had happened before they came to us.
We believe that they may have been coloured in to be used for dog fighting.
It was horrendous and we were thinking those cats were probably minutes away from being ripped to shreds by dogs, and they were tiny.
We're aware of other incidents where cats have been used as bait for dog fighting."
"Lord Janner signed a letter saying he wanted to remain a peer just a week before he was ruled unfit to face child sex charges. Abuse campaigners last night angrily questioned why the suspected paedophile was able to remain in the House of Lords if he was too frail to be brought before court. The Crown Prosecution Service has faced widespread criticism since announcing last week that Janner would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer’s disease. But now it has emerged that the peer was apparently well enough to sign his name in an April 9 note to Lords authorities. Scroll down for video . Controversy: Lord Janner, who will not face child sex charges because he has dementia, with his daughter, rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner . Signed: The letter Lord Janner signed on April 9. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasons . The former Labour MP, 86, claimed more than £100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances in the four years after he was diagnosed with dementia in 2009. He has not attended the Lords since detectives raided his North London home in December 2013. Last October he took a formal leave of absence from Parliament, allowing him to resume his duties after giving three months’ notice. New rules which came into effect last May provide a way for peers to retire permanently while keeping their titles and certain perks. But Janner requested an extension of his leave of absence instead of offering to stand down in the letter sent to a senior Lords official 12 days ago. A House of Lords spokesman confirmed the alleged paedophile signed the note himself, but could not confirm whether the handwriting below the signature was his. Simon Danczuk, the Labour politician who exposed the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith’s horrific abuse of boys, said it was not right for Janner to stay in the Lords yet avoid court. ‘If you are putting yourself forward to remain a legislator, then surely you are fit enough to be tested before the law,’ he said. ‘If he has got a leave of absence from the Lords, that implies that he may get well. Why isn’t he retiring? It makes a mockery of it all. He is bringing the House of Lords into disrepute almost single-handedly.’ The Crown Prosecution Service faced widespread criticism after announcing that Janner (pictured) would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer’s disease . Pete Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, added: ‘He couldn’t have signed this letter if he was non compos mentis. ‘But if he isn’t compos mentis, there’s no way he should be anywhere near our legislature. How can they say he’s not fit to stand trial for the most serious of crimes when he himself has argued that age should not be a barrier to prosecuting Nazi war criminals? ‘It stinks of the Establishment covering up and ensuring he doesn’t have to take the stand in public. This is a cover-up, there can be no question about it.’ Janner’s alleged victims have accused him of preying on boys at care homes around his former Leicester West constituency. He was suspended by Labour after the CPS ruled last Thursday that there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. But Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said he would not be prosecuted because his deteriorating dementia means there could be no criminal conviction. Allegations against the peer were first made public in 1991 during the trial of Frank Beck, a manager of Leicester children’s homes accused of abusing more than 200 boys. After Beck was jailed, many other politicians spoke out in support of Janner in a Commons debate led by Leicestershire North West Tory MP David Ashby. Mr Ashby, 74, who stood down from Parliament in 1997 after being caught up in the Major government’s sleaze scandals, appeared to repeat his backing for the peer yesterday. ‘Of course I didn’t know anything at the time,’ he said from his home in South-West London. ‘The man has dementia and should be left alone.’ Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Lord Janner's QC son . Prosecutors were forced to defend a senior legal adviser yesterday over fears of a conflict of interest in the Janner case. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Labour peer’s QC son. Neil Moore, who was based at the 23 Essex Street chambers where Daniel Janner works, was consulted by Mrs Saunders before she concluded not to prosecute. Senior police officers have privately raised concerns with her about Mr Moore’s involvement in the decision-making process. But a spokesman for the UK’s top prosecutor said she made the decision alone and that Mr Moore informed her of the connection before any discussions took place. She said Mr Moore was a barrister of the highest integrity and had not spoken to Mr Janner for two years. The potential for a conflict of interest is unhelpful for Mrs Saunders as she tackles the aftermath of her controversial decision. Last week it was revealed she over-ruled an expert in child abuse cases by deciding not to charge Janner. Eleanor Laws QC recommended a ‘trial of the facts’ in the defendant’s absence to ‘get to the bottom of the allegations’. A CPS spokesman said: ‘It is the DPP’s job to make these extremely difficult decisions, and that is what the DPP has done.’"
"The firm, which controls two-fifths of the Scotch whisky industry, reported Scotch sales down 5% by volume.
However, single malts from Scotland continued their rise, led by the Singleton in the US and Taiwan.
American whiskey sales were also strengthened by apple-flavoured bottlings.
The London-based company has lost momentum due to slowing growth in key markets, including South America and China.
It has had lower shipments, as wholesalers have pulled back on stock-holding.
Despite flat comparable sales, Diageo posted a rise in pre-tax profits - from £2.7bn to £2.9bn. A big increase in volume of sales was driven by the acquisition of United Spirits in India, which boosted reported net sales by 5%.
Currency movements had an impact on its results, most significantly the Venezuelan bolivar and the Russian ruble. That cut £370m from sales and £100m from operating profit, once translated into sterling.
Some markets saw Diageo facing tough price competition, including Smirnoff vodka in the US and Johnnie Walker whisky in Brazil.
Notable improvements in sales were reported for Johnnie Walker in Mexico, while Guinness returned to growth in its UK and Irish home market.
American Blonde Lager drove Guinness sales up in the US. Net sales were up 6% in Africa.
Other developments during the financial year included a buyout of the remaining half of the Don Julio tequila brand, the sale of Gleneagles hotel and resort in Perthshire, and a shifting of strategy in South Africa to focus on spirits.
Diageo chief executive Ivan Menezes said the performance reflected the company's sales challenges, and that further changes were under way to sharpen the business.
He added: ""We have consistently applied a long-term perspective in making changes, despite the short-term challenges we have faced from an external environment where currency volatility continues to impact the emerging market consumer.""
He claimed the current financial year would see volume of sales improve, rising to about 5% organic sales growth from 2017, with improved margins."
"""Listen up,"" splashes the News Letter. The paper takes us to the European Parliament in Strasbourg and reports on the telling off Michael Barnier got from a UUP MEP.
Jim Nicholson was speaking in the chamber about Northern Ireland's ""integral roll in the UK"" when he saw the French politician ""twiddling with his telephone"".
The Armagh MEP suggested Mr Barnier ""actually listen to the speech"".
The paper reports that the two made up later, however, with Mr Nicholson saying they had a ""good and constructive meeting"" in the chief Brexit negotiator's office.
Cat lovers, look away now. The Belfast Telegraph reports that three cats who have made the grounds of Stormont their home are the latest victims of the collapse of the political institutions.
A security review means a pensioner has been banned from feeding the cats, says the paper.
Edna Watters said she was ""broken-hearted"" as she has been caring for cats at Stormont, day-in, day-out, for 30 years.
The paper reports it has seen an email from the Stormont Estate Management Unit (SEMU), saying: ""Only those visitors with a valid business reason can access restricted areas of the estate.
""Feeding cats does not constitute a business need,"" it adds.
Hence why Edna has been refused entry. But there may be light at the end of the tunnel for the 76-year-old - the cats' homes are to be moved to a more suitable area where she will be free to visit them.
The Irish News leads with the news of a spike in calls to a Belfast surgery from patients fearing they will die after a spate of sudden deaths over the weekend.
At least three of the five Belfast deaths, one of which was a 16-year old girl, were connected to drugs, say police.
Dr Michael McKenna, whose surgery is based on the Falls Road, said one of the people who died was a patient of his and he had been contacted by several people, including a teenager who had taken 20 ""street diazepam"" at once.
One headline in the paper strikes a particularly bitter-sweet note.
""Parents whose newborn son died now raffling ex-Tyrone stars boots in aid of hospital baby unit"". Ballinderry couple Sinead and Cormac McIvor's baby Franky tragically died after living for a few days before passing away in February.
But the big-hearted couple are hoping to raise money for the Royal's neo-natal intensive care unit in Belfast by auctioning Tyrone GAA star Owen Mulligan's boots.
Mrs McIvor said she and her husband were keen to help the unit after the expert care baby Franky received.
Talk about building with bricks and Donald Trump might bring to mind US plans for a wall along the border with Mexico, but the News Letter has the story of a Belfast artist who has captured the image of the POTUS using Lego bricks.
The creation, which is of President Trump as a teenager, is just one of the subjects of David Turner's latest collection which looks at famous politicians in their ""formative years"".
It looks like the piece has already been snapped up by an art collector.
The Belfast Telegraph reports that a ""massive quantity of 20p coins"", understood to amount to thousands of pounds, were stolen from a house in Ligoniel in north Belfast on Tuesday.
The coins were in two large glass jars.
All the papers report on the PSNI's ""action plan"" to recruit more Catholics.
However bringing back the 50/50 policy has been ruled out.
The Irish News says recent recruitment drives have ""struggled to attract new Catholic officers"".
The News Letter says the PSNI intends to start a new recruitment drive targeting ""cold spots"" this autumn.
A number of changes will also be made in the recruitment process, it says."
"Another user in the dark web - a hidden part of the internet where guns, drugs and child abuse images are traded - alerted police, a spokesperson said.
The boy's body was subsequently found in the cellar of a house in Herne, North Rhine-Westphalia.
Police say the 19-year-old suspect may be armed.
Searches are being carried out in towns near Herne, which lies in the Ruhr area, a heavily industrialised region.
Reports say the suspect, who is on the run, is a martial arts enthusiast."
"Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Sunderland means United remain six points adrift of the Premier League top four.
Asked afterwards if United can still make the Champions League places, Van Gaal said: ""It will be very difficult.
""After this match, the Europa League is our best route but it will not be easy because there are so many good teams.""
Since last season, the winners of the Europa League have been rewarded with a place in either the Champions League final qualifying stage or the group stage.
United play the first leg of their Europa League last-32 tie against Danish side FC Midtjylland on Thursday.
They play Shrewsbury in the FA Cup next weekend and do not return to Premier League action until 28 February when they play third-placed Arsenal at Old Trafford.
Van Gaal says he has not given up hope of matching United's fourth-place finish from his first campaign in charge, but has warned his squad that it now looks unlikely.
""We have given five points away against Chelsea and now Sunderland, so it is too much at this time,"" he added.
""I have said that also to the players, because you cannot close your eyes to it. It is still possible but the Europa League is easier I think.
""It is also not so easy, because there is also a fantastic level in that competition, so we will have to fight for it."""
"The 29-year-old terminated his contract with the O's after the transfer window closed, and cannot join another EFL side until January.
""I wouldn't say I'm in a predicament, but I have never been in this position before,"" Cox told BBC Radio London.
""It is not a nice thing for a footballer. I'm not able to do my job.""
The former Brighton man continued: ""I am going to have to sit it out again for four months before I can kick a ball in the League again.
""I'll try to make the best of it. It is hard to train on your own and keep yourself motivated but it is something which has got to be done.""
Cox left Orient on 1 September after turning down a move to League One Northampton Town.
Having spent six years with the O's, scoring 59 times in 275 appearances, Cox said he was ""an emotional wreck"" on his departure from Brisbane Road.
""I didn't really want to leave but, circumstances being what they were, I felt like I had no choice,"" he said.
""We had come to our conclusion that we were going to go our separate ways. I can't really elaborate on it for legal reasons.
""It is a club I will always love. When I finish playing I want to be a manager and if I can go back there and manage one day that would be great.""
Cox, who has only just recovered from a long-term knee injury, is aiming to agree a contract with an EFL club which will commence in January before seeking a short-term deal with a non-league side to keep up his match fitness.
""I was just getting back in the groove,"" he said. ""If I can get something sorted sooner rather than later League-wise, then great.
""Hopefully the clubs I speak to will understand my situation. I'm not too proud to play in lower divisions as I need to play.
""Come January, I need to be ready to kick on.""
Cox has already held initial negotiations with League Two side Crawley Town.
""It interests me because they are local to where I am,"" he said.
""It ticks the boxes and I used to play with the captain Jimmy Smith at Orient. The manager [Dermot Drummy] wants attractive attacking football, which is great for me because that is the way I like to play.
""By no means is it a done deal. We have had talks and we'll see how that goes.""
You can hear an interview with Dean Cox on BBC Radio London's Saturday Sport show, which begins at 13:00 BST."
"Liverpool target Neto is also wanted by PSG and clubs in Spain as Brendan Rodgers faces stiff competition to land the Fiorentina goalkeeper, according to the Brazilian's agent Stefano Castagna. The Reds were linked with a move for the 25-year-old, whose contract expires in June, earlier in the season when Simon Mignolet was dropped from the side. A January move for Neto never materialised but the former Atletico Paranaense keeper looks certain to leave the Florence-based club in the summer. Neto rushes from his goal as Juan Iturbe bears down on him during Fiorentina's clash with Roma in March . Neto is wanted by a number of top European clubs including Liverpool and PSG, according to his agent . It had been reported that Neto had a verbal agreement to join Serie A champions Juventus at the end of the season but his agent has revealed no decision about his future has been made yet. And Castagna claims Neto will have his pick of top European clubs when the transfer window re-opens in the summer, including Brendan Rodgers' side. 'There are many European clubs interested in Neto, such as for example Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain,' Stefano Castagna is quoted as saying by Gazzetta TV. Firoentina goalkeeper Neto saves at the feet of Tottenham midfielder Nacer Chadli in the Europa League . 'In Spain too there are clubs at the very top level who are tracking him. Real Madrid? We'll see. 'We have not made a definitive decision, but in any case he will not accept another loan move elsewhere.' Neto, who represented Brazil at the London 2012 Olympics but has not featured for the senior side, was warned against joining a club as a No 2 by national coach Dunga. Neto joined Fiorentina from Atletico Paranaense in 2011 and established himself as No1 in the last two seasons."
"Maate, it's the biggest bogan in Straya! This is the image of the Big Bogan statue that the Bogan Shire Council is aiming to erect in the town of Nyngan to honour the Aussie icon - and hopefully draw in the crowds. The man behind it all is Graeme Burke who is the manager of engineering services for the council and this is his design for the statue. This is how Graeme Burke envisages the 'Big Bogan' statue will look like . Pass us a smoke mate: The term 'bogan' has a number of negative connotations for Australians but has become a character part of popular folklore, being depicted here by actor Eric Bana . Mr Burke said the 3.6-metre statue would show a 'bloke' wearing shorts, thongs and a singlet with a fishing rod and a tuckerbox. Locals and visitors would also be able to sit on it and take photographs. 'Graham McCleod of the Anglican Church suggestion to me some time ago that Nyngan would benefit froma “Big Bogan” sculpture as a tourist attraction so I have been considering various designs for its construction,' Mr Burke told Daily Mail Australia. 'Although I do not like the way a 'bogan' is depicted and I do not want Nyngan to be thought of as being a town full of “bogans”, it is a term that is widely used and well known in Australia and New Zealand. 'Where better in Australia could we have “The Big Bogan” than on the banks of the Bogan River, in Bogan Shire?' Bogan Shire Council, in western New South Wales, wants to erect a 'big bogan' statue . The 'big bogan' statue could prove as popular as the Big Banana which is a tourist attraction in Coffs Harbour . Mr Burke's proposal is for a 3.6m tall steel figure cut out of 5mm steel plate. The figure is wearing a singlet, has a handlebar moustache and is holding a fishing rod. The esky in the original drawing would be constructed as a three dimensional steel box fixed to the sculpture to allow tourists to sit on to have their photo taken. 'I would like the sculpture to be related to Nyngan on the Bogan River, I have used the fishing theme and I would like to see it located on the eastern side of the Peter Sinclair Bridge opposite the Tritton Mine Village,' Mr Bourke said. 'In this location it would be on the highway, at the river, and visible from both directions.' The traditional bogan image has include a 'mullett' style haircut, singlet and thongs, and beer . Could the 'big bogan' rival this?  Nicknamed 'Rambo', The Big Merino is a 15.2 metres tall concrete merino ram, located in Goulburn, New South Wales . The Big Prawn in Ballina has become famous in the region . He estimated the construction and installation of the 'Big Bogan' would be a total cost of $8,000. The 'big bogan' statue could prove as popular as the Big Banana which is a tourist attraction in Coffs Harbour, the The Big Merino in Goulburn, the Big Prawn in Ballina and Sunshine Coast's Big Pineapple. However, Bogan Shire Council said the venture would not go ahead until the community gave it the thumbs up. ABC News reports that local residents have expressed mixed feelings about it already. In the Sunshine Coast, the Big Pineapple is a major feature . One said it was a great idea - but it could be improved. 'One thing that's missing is the stubby,' he said. Another resident was less enthusiastic. 'I do not identify as a bogan - if you look up bogan, it's very negative,' she said."
"Inverness-born Gillan's big break came when she was cast as Doctor Who companion Amy Pond.
While Pond was part of a force for good, Gillan's character in Guardians of the Galaxy has a villainous dark side.
With a reported production budget of Â£17m, Guardians of the Galaxy forms part of Marvel's so-called ""Phase 2"" project.
The first phase involved the development and release of superhero movies featuring well-known comic book characters such as Iron Man, Captain America and Thor.
Guardians' cast includes Chris Pratt, who provided the voice for Emmet Brickowoski in box office hit The Lego Movie, and Zoe Saldana, who starred in Avatar and the two recent Star Trek movies.
Directed by James Gunn, Guardians of the Galaxy draws on characters and stories that first appeared in Marvel comics in 1969.
Gillan's character Nebula first appeared in the comics in 1985.
Last July, Gillan unveiled part of her look for the film at Comic-Con International in San Diego, one of the world's biggest celebrations of comic books and movies based on them.
During a press conference with other cast members, she removed a wig to reveal a shaven head.
At the UK premiere for Guardians of the Galaxy earlier this week, Gillan told the BBC how designers working on the new Star Wars film made the wig she wore at Comic-Con.
Gillan's character, Nebula, has been described in the Marvel comics as a ruthless space pirate and former leader of a band of mercenaries.
There are glimpses of Gillan in trailers being seen in cinemas and online ahead of the movie's release.
The actress also features on the cover of a special edition of the August issue of UK film magazine, Empire.
On the cover with her are Djimon Hounsou, who plays Korath the Pursuer and previously starred with Russell Crowe in Gladiator, and Hobbit films actor Lee Pace who plays the film's chief bad guy Ronan the Accuser.
After Guardians of the Galaxy, Gillan is set to star in the Western, In a Valley of Violence.
The film's cast also includes Grease and Pulp Fiction actor John Travolta, Training Day's Ethan Hawke and American Horror Story's Taissa Farmiga.
Gillan, who as a youngster performed at Inverness' Eden Court Theatre, will also appear on US television this autumn.
She has been cast as the lead in new ABC series, Selfie.
The Scot plays Eliza Dooley who has 263,000 social media followers who hang on to her every post, tweet and selfie.
Eliza seeks help from a marketing guru played by John Cho, no stranger himself to strange, new alien worlds as Sulu in the Star Treks films, to ""re-brand"" her self-obsessed reputation.
Guardians of the Galaxy starts showing in UK cinemas later this month."
"The body of a dead sperm whale that washed up on a California beach last week was covered in graffiti spelling out the name of a Bay Area motorcycle gang.

It's unclear how the whale died but it doesn't appear to have broken bones or signs of blunt force trauma . The name was erased by Wednesday's high tide, NBC Bay Area reported. The club did not respond to a request for comment. It is unknown how the whale died but it does not appear to have any broken bones or show signs of blunt force trauma.

"Conservative MP Damian Collins made the call after US media claims that former Fifa executive Chuck Blazer recorded conversations with football officials at the London 2012 Olympics.
Russia will host the 2018 World Cup after England's unsuccessful bid.
The 2022 World Cup will be in Qatar.
The SFO can investigate ""cases which undermine UK commercial/financial PLC in general and the City of London in particular"" and has been following bribery claims stemming from the December 2010 decision to award rights for the next two World Cups.
Fifa has already undertaken its own investigation into the corruption allegations, led by independent ethics investigator Michael Garcia.
American Blazer was a member of Fifa's executive committee from 1996 to 2013.
On Sunday, the New York Daily News alleged US FBI agents recruited Blazer by threatening him with arrest and prosecution for tax fraud if he failed to cooperate.
Media playback is not supported on this device
The paper says Blazer was supplied with a modified keyring that contained a tiny microphone in order to secretly record conversations with leading football officials during a visit to the London 2012 Olympic Games.
""If there is evidence that Chuck Blazer held meetings during the Olympics, that would come under the jurisdiction of the SFO,"" Collins told BBC Sport.
""I want to see if they would now be prepared to act.""
Fifa declined to comment about Blazer when contacted.
BBC Sport has seen a letter from the SFO to Collins, sent before the allegations about Blazer were published, which said the crime bureau was watching corruption allegations ""with interest"".
The letter added that the SFO did not believe it had the right to launch its own inquiry.
SFO director David Green told Collins: ""The allegations that have occurred so far are against non-UK nationals and the alleged conduct took place outside of the UK.""
That could now change if reports of Blazer recording officials in London are accurate.
Green's letter adds: ""I can... assure you that the SFO will continue to keep the jurisdictional position under review.""
Collins wrote to the SFO in September asking it to seek access to the report produced by Michael Garcia.
Garcia spent 18 months interviewing individuals from nations wanting to stage the 2018 and 2022 finals - and wants greater transparency from Fifa.
But Fifa president Sepp Blatter said Garcia's full report will not be published because of legal issues.
The information that will be eventually be revealed is now in the hands of Hans-Joachim Eckert, a German judge tasked by Fifa with deciding if any individuals breached the organisation's code of ethics.
He is due to make an interim statement later this month, which may include redacted sections of Garcia's findings.
Collins is concerned that information relating to claims made by former chairman of the FA Lord Triesman concerning alleged corruption could be contained within Garcia's files but will not be made public.
Lord Triesman made a series of allegations concerning his time involved with England's 2018 bid in evidence to a House of Lords committee in 2011.
Furthermore, Collins asked the SFO to consider whether evidence of any additional wrongdoing, which might fall under its jurisdiction, could be revealed by obtaining access to Garcia's report.
In light of the SFO's response and Chuck Blazer's alleged role as an FBI informant, Collins believes Fifa must now publish Garcia's findings and inform the relevant law enforcement agencies.
""If Fifa is sitting on evidence relating to acts of bribery and corruption, then it is more than just a football matter,"" Collins said.
""It is unthinkable they wouldn't reveal what they have.
""There are people who are stopping evidence being made available. You'll have to draw your own conclusions as to why that is."""

Hernandez is welcomed by the ecstatic Real Madrid fans following his late goal against rivals Atletico . Henry told Sky Sports: ‘To be fair to him he doesn’t really play. He was given an opportunity tonight but we still don’t know whether he will play again. ‘He had a couple of chances in the game. One on his left foot and then another on his right foot. But I can tell you, he needs to thank (Cristiano) Ronaldo tonight. ‘I know he went on to celebrate alone and everything but he needs to thank Ronaldo, because for me he has to. It’s Ronaldo who chooses to change the course of the game. ‘He (Ronaldo) should’ve passed the ball in the first-half but he didn't, but he did in the second-half because he knew he needed to finish them (Atletico Madrid) there and then. ‘That is for me Ronaldo’s goal. There is two minutes to go, he didn’t want to take that chance because he knows Hernandez is in a better position so you have to play that ball. ‘Ronaldo gave him that ball so that goal is Ronaldo’s goal.

Hernandez falls backwards in celebration after his late goal earned Real Madrid a Champions League victory . ‘He saw a guy in a better position, which Hernandez was, and he gave him the ball, so that is Ronaldo’s goal. ‘What I don’t like is that he celebrates like he has just won the World Cup. It’s a tap in. Turn around and celebrate with Ronaldo. ‘He knew he had to perform and he had a couple of chances to do it. Even the camera knew, the camera is on Ronaldo for a reason.’ Hernandez and Ronaldo celebrate as Real Madrid beat rivals Atletico Madrid in the Champions League . Thierry Henry was quick to criticise the Mexican striker for the way in which he celebrated his winner . However, former Liverpool defender and fellow pundit Jamie Carragher was quick to highlight that Ronaldo would have done the same if it was his late winner. The 37-year-old told Sky Sports: ‘It was Ronaldo’s goal in terms of what he did for the goal but Ronaldo is the worst in the world at things like that. 'He took a penalty in the final last year to make it 4-1, he takes his top off and becomes the picture the next day.' But former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher didn't share the same views as former Arsenal man Henry ."
"Both were on the vessel, Tara, when it ran into trouble between Bokpunt and Gansekraal, at about 04:30 on Monday.
The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said a 61-year-old Scottish man, and 49-year-old woman from the Republic of Ireland, died in the incident.
A 66-year-old man, also from the Republic of Ireland, made it ashore and raised the alarm.
The South African Maritime Safety Authority is investigating the circumstances which led to the tragedy.
The NSRI - a South African organisation similar to the RNLI in the UK - said its sea rescue rafts and a police dive unit had responded once the alarm was raised.
Rescue teams, however, discovered the yacht broken up among rocks on the shore.
The NSRI said it was not known what had caused the yacht to hit the rocks and whether it had capsized before running aground.
A spokesman said there were three crew members on board, reportedly sailing from Langebaan to Cape Town.
The 66-year-old man who raised the alarm is originally from the Republic of Ireland but resident in the Western Cape.
A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ""We are liaising with local authorities and seeking further information following the tragic death of a British national in Cape Town, South Africa."""

"Her stepson, filmmaker Carlo Alberto Pinelli, told the Hollywood Reporter that she had died on 1 May in Spain.
In Casablanca, Lebeau plays Humphrey Bogart's spurned lover.
In a famous scene, she tearfully shouts ""Vive La France"", after the clientele in Rick's CafÃ© sing La Marseillaise to drown out singing by German soldiers.
Born in 1923 near Paris, she fled Nazi-occupied France with her then husband, prominent actor Marcel Dalio, in 1940.
The couple ended up in Hollywood, and both played in Casablanca.
In the film, Bogart plays an American cafe owner in Morocco, a territory controlled by France's Nazi collaborationist regime. He must choose between his love for a woman and helping her husband escape Casablanca to continue fighting the Nazis.
Lebeau played in two more US films before returning to France after the war.
Her subsequent work includes the role of a temperamental French actress in Fellini's 8 1/2 (1963)."
"The four are now in police custody, after a crime spree that included raids on hotels, small shops and amusement arcades, Italian media report.
On one occasion they allegedly raced off in a Porsche Cayenne after pointing a pistol in the driver's face.
The gang reportedly boasted of their crimes in video clips on social media.
They stole cash, smartphones, tablets and even on one occasion a youth's luxury shoes worth â‚¬530 (Â£465; $601), according to police. The crimes took place in Milan's Quarto Oggiaro district.
Two of the young suspects are Italians aged 14 and 16, the others are of foreign origin, aged 15 and 17.
They came from broken homes and are thought to have been controlled by an Egyptian man, aged 23. He is under arrest on a drugs charge and was convicted for previous offences.
Police found that the youths - dubbed a ""baby gang"" in Italian media - possessed several firearms, including a pump-action shotgun.
Italy's Rai news website said investigators ""stressed that the baby gang used brutal violence on their victims in the style of A Clockwork Orange"".
One victim, a young man attacked in the street, was pistol-whipped and needed 10 stitches for a deep wound.
The 1971 film A Clockwork Orange, directed by Stanley Kubrick, was a box-office hit. Based on a futuristic novel by Anthony Burgess, it portrayed a gang of juvenile delinquents who made a cult of gratuitous violence."
"Nicola Sturgeon will today launch an extraordinary bid to ‘lead the UK’ as she unveils a string of policies apparently tailor-made for a power-sharing deal with Labour. The SNP leader will unveil a manifesto including proposals for British foreign policy, welfare payments, energy bills and English university tuition fees. Several of her election pledges overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS. Others are calculated to drag a minority Labour government to the left, including halting the roll-out of Iain Duncan Smith’s popular changes to benefits and cancelling the Trident nuclear weapons system. Scroll down for video . Control: The Tories warn SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will be Ed Miliband's puppet master if he becomes Prime Minister after the election . Several election pledges in Miss Sturgeon's manifesto overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS . The SNP also wants the UK to formally recognise Palestine as a state, give energy regulator Ofgem the power to force suppliers to cut prices and to increase public spending on infrastructure in northern England and Wales. At the heart of the SNP’s manifesto are plans for what Miss Sturgeon has called ‘modest’ spending increases funded by yet more borrowing – but which in fact total £180billion over five years. Scotland’s First Minister, who is not herself running for a Westminster seat, said yesterday the SNP had much in common with Left-wing Labour MPs and aimed to build a ‘progressive alliance’ for people ‘right across the UK’. ‘There is an opportunity to build progressive alliances for progressive policies. It is a real rather than a pretend alternative to austerity,’ she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. Today’s SNP election manifesto will be the first to be the focus of intense national scrutiny. Polls suggest the party is on course for a landslide victory north of the border, winning as many as 50 seats and holding the balance of power at Westminster. That could trigger constitutional turmoil of the sort that followed the 1910 election, when Irish Nationalists surged and ended up with more than 70 seats. In the years that followed, there was bitter conflict and the larger part of Ireland eventually seceded from the UK. The huge surge in support for the SNP could see senior Labour figures such as Jim Murphy (left) and Douglas Alexander (right) lose their seats . The latest Scotland-wide YouGov survey shows the SNP on a record 49 per cent, up three, with Labour trailing on 25 per cent, down four. The Conservatives were on 18 per cent and Liberal Democrats on just four per cent. The scale of the shift in traditional Labour strongholds in Scotland is unprecedented in modern European politics. Even senior Labour figures, including the Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and the shadow foreign secretary and the party’s election campaign coordinator, Douglas Alexander, are facing defeat. The SNP will declare today that a ‘strong team’ of SNP MPs in Westminster would help ‘rebalance the UK - both politically and economically - from the chronic over-dominance of the City of London, which has harmed the overall UK economy and left regions of England neglected’. Miss Sturgeon insisted those who had asked Scotland to remain in the UK in last year’s independence referendum could not now object to it calling the shots at Westminster. ‘We were told by leaders of the No campaign during the closing stages of the referendum debate that Scotland’s voice really mattered. Indeed, we were told that Scotland shouldn’t leave the UK but lead the UK,’ she said. ‘So it is more than a bit rich, now that Scotland has decided to remain part of the Westminster system, for anyone in London or elsewhere to try and imply that Scotland’s voice shouldn’t be heard or that Scotland’s voice somehow becomes an illegitimate one if people here decide to elect a large number of SNP MPs.’ However, the First Minister will face tough questions at today’s launch over her plans for ‘full fiscal autonomy’ or effective ‘home rule’, which would see almost every power apart from foreign affairs and defence devolved to Holyrood. It would end the generous Barnett Formula that funds Scotland. The Institute for Fiscal Studies  has predicted that a ‘fiscally autonomous’ Scotland would have a £7.6billion black hole in its finances."
"She has also decided to appoint a number of civil servants to the board of the organisation.
In effect, the arms-length body is now under hands-on control by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) after a troubled few months.
Ms Ní Chuilín met the Sport NI board on Wednesday and said allegations about its leadership were ""deeply troubling"".
Nine of the organisation's 14 board members resigned on Monday, but they have yet to explain why they stood down.
Concerns have been raised about working practices within Sport NI, and at least 10 employees have made complaints.
The minister said it had been important to ""act swiftly and decisively"" after being made aware of the issues last week.
She added that she was introducing measures to ""address the concerns raised and to reassure me"" that the organisation is fit for purpose.
The chairman of Sport NI's board welcomed the minister's intervention.
Brian Henning said the board needed help, and he did not feel the appointment of senior civil servants to top positions undermined the board.
Mr Henning will remain as board chairman.
An interim executive leadership team has been appointed to take on the day-to-day running of Sport NI.
It will be headed by senior civil servant Arthur Scott, currently the director of culture at DCAL, who will act as a temporary chief executive.
An internal audit investigation shed light on issues surrounding the leadership of Sport NI.
Ms Ní Chuilín has instructed the civil servants she has sent in to implement its recommendations.
They include carrying out a confidential employee survey and a full audit of Sport NI's working culture to determine whether the allegations have a basis.
It will also begin a full review of grievances and appeals that are currently ongoing.
The minister said: ""All of these actions are necessary to support Sport NI through a challenging period of change and to provide all staff with the reassurance that we have taken their views and concerns seriously."""
"Aside from making a fighter jet lightweight, agile and astonishingly fast, engineers of one the world's most advanced aircraft have another, more surprising issue to contend with: the moon. BAE System's Typhoon is so accurate that even the movements of the tide can disrupt the jet fighter's positioning and accuracy. To counteract even the slightest shifts in gravitational pull, experts must build the jet on 'floating' concrete rafts that move in sync with the moon. The Typhoon (pictured) is powered by two Eurojet EJ200 engines. It is 49ft (15 metres) long from tip to tip and the material is 'no more than the thickness of a match stick.' This helps its ‘fly by wire’ computer system to accurately control the aircraft, designed to be unstable but hugely agile . These rafts measure 59ft (18 metres) long and 9.8ft (3 metres) thick and are used to house the measuring equipment. Two laser trackers and nine jacks are positioned on a single surface, to make sure all movement is relative, and they control the alignment of the barges by cancelling out the subtle effects of the moon and the tides it creates. This means the jet will be in 'near perfect alignment whatever the moon may be doing,' said Martin Topping, Head of Typhoon Maintenance and Upgrade.

"For Celtic, a slow-burning season has seen Ronny Deila’s side raise their game after a stuttering start and eventually rout their nearest rivals. Their steady emergence under the Norwegian has seen them swat aside second-placed Aberdeen 8-2 on aggregate over three matches and eradicate fourth-placed Dundee United 17-3 over the course of six games. Yet although the Parkhead side have in recent times looked like an increasingly irresistible force in the race for the treble, it has been left to third-placed Inverness Caley Thistle to enhance their credentials as the team most likely to represent a potential stumbling block on Ronny Deila’s march towards history. Leigh Griffiths (left) fired Celtic into an early lead in their encounter against Inverness . Griffiths runs over to celebrate his opening strike with the travelling Celtic supporters . Griffiths (right) celebrates his third minute goal with his Celtic team-mates, but the lead did not last long . In three games this season, there has been nothing between these two teams. In August, Celtic lost 1-0 at Tulloch Caledonian Stadium, before gaining revenge with a 1-0 win at Parkhead in November. On Saturday, Deila’s side were held to a draw by Caley Thistle. Yet while Celtic were surprisingly poor, the evidence from the weekend also suggests that Inverness possess a potent blend of passion and physicality which, more so than any other side in the country, seems to knock Deila’s men out of their stride. For goalkeeper Craig Gordon, Saturday’s 1-1 draw - which included a quick-fire goal from Leigh Griffiths and one in immediate response Edward Ofere - served as a warning shot against complacency in the quest for a rare domestic clean sweep. The Scotland goalkeeper believes his side will need to fight with every sinew when the two tribes renew hostilities in Sunday’s Scottish Cup semi final at Hampden if Celtic’s dream of winning a fourth treble is not to be shattered. ‘It’s a good little reminder that we are in for a big fight next week,’ said the Scotland international. ‘Inverness are a good team. They are big and physical - but they can also pass the ball. ‘They were up for it and they put us under a bit of pressure today. They’ve got a little bit of everything about them and, on any given day, they are more than capable of winning a game. ‘They pressed us high and they will try to do that again at Hampden. Hopefully we will learn from this and play better. But the one thing we know for sure is that we will be in for a battle next weekend.’ Edward Ofere (left) equalised for Inverness from close range a minute after Griffiths scoring . Ofere (left) wheels away in celebration after swiftly levelling the score for Inverness against Celtic . Celtic found it tough to play on a bumpy surface at the Tulloch Caledonian Stadium. But Gordon reckons the recently re-laid turf at Hampden will benefit Inverness just as much as the treble-chasers. ‘It will be a different venue on a different pitch but that won’t have any bearing,’ he said. ‘The pitch at Hampden will help us but it will be good for Inverness as well because they like to pass the ball about. ‘Both sides were aggressive today in trying to press, there was nothing nasty about it. Everyone was just trying to get one over their direct opponent ahead of the semi final and neither team wanted to lose ahead of next weekend. ‘We all know next weekend is a big one but we’ve also got a midweek league match (against Kilmarnock) at home on Wednesday night sandwiched right in the middle of these two Inverness games. ‘We need to keep picking up points. If we can win against Kilmarnock we can go into the semi-final high on confidence and looking to beat Inverness.’ If Celtic felt ill at ease on a poor pitch and blowing wind, it did not show as the elements played a part in the opening goal after just 135 seconds. The wind held up Scott Brown’s long ball and Griffiths set himself up before blasting past Dean Brill from 25 yards for a terrific goal. Inverness goalkeeper Dean Brill was substituted off injured after 20 minutes against Celtic . Stuart Armstrong of Celtic tackles Ryan Christie of Inverness in Saturday's early Scottish Premiership match . Inverness were level almost straight away, however, when David Raven’s shanked shot was directed goalwards by Ryan Christie. Belgian defender Jason Denayer cleared the ball off the line but only as far as Nigeria forward Ofere, who was there to ram home his second goal for Caley Thistle since joining the club in January. It had been a breathtaking opening five minutes but the next incident of note was a horror show for Brill as the enthusiastic Gary Mackay-Steven chased down a loose ball and accidentally caught the Caley Thistle keeper, who collapsed to the deck in agony. As the keeper was treated by medics on the park, Mackay-Steven kept checking on the welfare of his stricken opponent. Jeered for his role in the incident, Mackay-Steven seemed spooked afterwards and fell out of the game, before being substituted by Kris Commons just after the hour mark. There was precious little else to talk about in the remainder of the match, apart from some decent saves by Brill’s replacement Ryan Esson from Efe Ambrose and Denayer - while Celtic captain Scott Brown was booked for ‘simulation’ after colliding with Raven in the box. Afterwards, Deila backed his man, saying Brown was ‘the last man in the world anyone can accuse of diving.’ Deila added: ‘He is a tough guy. It’s not a big issue.’ Keeper Gordon, meanwhile, tried to remain philosophical over two lost points in a title race which has been going Celtic’s way for quite some time. ‘I think a point was probably fair today. It’s always tough here and you always get a battle,’ he said. ‘That’s pretty much what it was like as the game never really settled down or had any real pattern to it. ‘We couldn’t impose ourselves and do what we wanted to do. The conditions were difficult, but it was the same for them. Both teams created a few opportunities but not too many and a draw was fair. We will need to be better next Sunday if we are to get a result.’"
"A Russian TV channel aired Hillary Clinton's first campaign video with a rating stamp that means it's for mature audiences, because of fears it might run afoul of the country's anti-gay propaganda law. A clip of the video, which features a gay couple holding hands, got the 18+ rating from the independent TV Rain channel in Russia on Monday. The channel told CNN that it didn't want to break the controversial law, which bans ""propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors"" and bars public discussion of gay rights and relationships within earshot of children. ""There are no legal precedents for this law, so we just don't know what comes under this law and (what) doesn't,"" a TV Rain spokesperson told CNN. ""Therefore, fearing to break the law -- especially given the high attention to TV Rain from the supervising authorities -- we decided to put a marker (on the video)."" Clinton's video was released over the weekend to announce the start of her 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. It features about five seconds of two men holding hands. One of the men says, ""I'm getting married this summer to someone I really care about."" The former senator and first lady first declared her support for same-sex marriage in early 2013, saying that ""gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights."" Russia's controversial law caused an international outcry after it was passed by the Russian Parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin in July 2013. Human Rights Watch described the anti-gay propaganda law as ""a profoundly discriminatory and dangerous bill that is bound to worsen homophobia in Russia."" Rights campaigners called for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and a number of bars around the world stopped serving Russian vodka in protest. U.S. President Barack Obama -- Clinton's former boss -- said at the time that he found the legislation offensive. ""I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or harmful to them,"" Obama told Jay Leno in 2013. Putin defended the law, noting that unlike other countries, Russia decriminalized homosexual relationships (in 1993). ""We don't outlaw anything and don't nab anyone,"" he said before the 2014 Games. ""That's why you can feel safe and free here,"" he added, ""but please leave our children in peace.""

"David Cameron embarked on his first proper walkabout of the election campaign today, and was soon told to 'f*** off back to Eton'. The Tory leader, who has been criticised for a dull campaign featuring a lack of ordinary voters, embarked on a tour of the streets of Alnwick to drum up support for his re-election. But he was reprimanded by one local woman for the 'name-calling' in the campaign, while a busker with a ukulele sang: 'f*** off back to Eton with all your Eton chums'. David Cameron embarked on his first proper walkabout of the campaign today in Alnwick, and was greeted by a man with a ukulele singing: 'F*** off back to Eton' Tory strategists had planned a low-key day while Labour leader Ed Miliband launched his party manifesto in Manchester. Mr Cameron has staged his first on-camera walkabout of the campaign - and was urged to avoid 'name calling' tactics against Ed Miliband. In an extraordinary attack last week, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon claimed Mr Miliband had stabbed his brother in the back to win the Labour leadership, and was now 'willing to stab the United Kingdom in the back to become prime minister' by giving up the Trident missile system to secure the support of the SNP. Mr Miliband rounded on the 'desperate smears' by Mr Cameron's 'minions'. Privately senior Tories admitted the attack had backfired, and triggered fresh complaints that it detracted from positive policies on freezing rail fares and volunteering. Today in Alnwick in Berwick-upon-Tweed constituency, one woman told Mr Cameron: 'I don't like the name calling in politics ... Be a good boy.' As Mr Cameron spoke to local voters, he was urged to avoid 'name calling' tactics against Ed Miliband . Despite the heckling, Mr Cameron was repeatedly stopped and asked to pose for selfies - a major feature of the election campaign . The Tory campaign was boosted by a new poll which suggested they have pulled away a six point lead over Labour . During his attempts to meet voters, the Prime Minister bought some sausages at Turnbull's butchers and chatted with shoppers during the 15 minute stroll. Mr Cameron was joined on his walkabout by Tory candidate Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who is trying to take the seat from the Lib Dems after incumbent Sir Alan Beith stood down. The premier also visited the Icon Plastics factory in Stockton South constituency, where Conservative James Wharton is defending a narrow 322 majority. Mr Cameron has been criticised for failing to engage with ordinary voters, but Tory insiders rejected the accusation. They said Mr Cameron had been on a 'walkabout' at Barry Island's seafront in Wales last week, held a 'Cameron Direct' question and answer session  with 150 members of the public and took part in a public hustings in his own constituency at the weekend. The Tory campaign was boosted by a new poll which suggested they have pulled away a six point lead over Labour. The Prime Minister bought some sausages at Turnbull's butchers and chatted with shoppers during the 15 minute stroll . The ICM survey shows David Cameron's party on 39 per cent, ahead of Labour on 33 per cent. The new  poll, published by The Guardian, had the Liberal Democrats unchanged on 8 per cent, Ukip down two points on 7 per cent and the Greens up three points on 7 per cent. The Conservatives were up 3 per cent in the poll and Labour down 2 per cent. It marks the Tories' best result in an ICM poll since March 2012, before the so-called 'omnishambles' budget."

Oshun Kong (left) made with coriander, ginger, lemongrass and sprinkled with sesame seeds. Courgette, lime, sour cherries and strawberries in the Oshun Tang (right) The fruit bowls include Oshun Native made with acaí pulp, banana and honey; The Oshun Tang made with courgette, lime, sour cherries and acai pulp; the Oshun Kong featuring acaí pulp, banana, lemongrass, ginger, coriander and honey; and the Oshun Maya with acaí pulp, raw cacao, cinnamon, orange and avocado. Liane Holey, founder of the cafe said: ‘Brazil’s streets are filled with vendors blending acaí pulp with fresh bananas and then topped with honey and granola to create an innocuously addictive berry bowl. ‘Oshun Cafe wants the UK to celebrate this way of eating acaí, not as powder, dried supplements or in smoothies and pasteurised juices which have significantly smaller amounts of Açaí and preserved nutrients.” The acaí berry is a rich purple fruit indigenous to the Amazon rainforest. For hundreds of years, the small dark berries have been integral to the diet of native Amazonian people. The Acai Berry Bowl Cafe will serve four types of berry bowls. The cafe is open from seven days a week . Oshun Maya with cinnamon, raw cacao, orange and avocado with nested popcorn . The berries taste like blueberries and dark chocolate, with a distinctly earthy aftertaste. They are a favourite of celebrities such as Victoria Beckham, Oprah Winfrey and Matthew McConaughey. Due to their high level of antioxidants the berries are considered a superfood.They also contain high levels of manganese and Omega and are renowned for their weight loss qualities. Oshun Native - acaí pulp, banana and honey. Oshun Tang: courgette, lime, sour cherries and acai pulp . Oshun Kong: banana, lemongrass, ginger, coriander and honey. Oshun Maya: acai berries, raw cacao, cinnamon, orange and avocado . Speaking about the potent powder, food blogger and nutritionist Deliciously Ella said: 'Acai is unbelievably rich in antioxidants, with one of the highest levels ever tested (eight times that of blueberries and 10 to 30 times that of red wine,) as well as vitamin E and omega-3s, all of which work to stop free radical damage and keep your body. 'It’s also amazing for keeping your skin glowing and slowing down the signs of ageing.' The large seed from each berry is removed and the remaining Açaí pulp (along with its nutrients) is frozen within 24 hours of being harvested, due to the fresh berry’s short lifespan. In Brazil, acai berry bowls are eaten around the clock. Melt Room, which only serves toasties - or 'melts' as they are known - will open in Soho, London in May . Cashing in on the trend for single-item menu restaurants, Melt Room, which only serves toasties - or 'melts' as they are known - will open its doors in May. The menu will offer a variety of sandwiches, from the classic grilled cheese which will set you back £4.50 to more upmarket fillings such as slow-cooked lamb shoulder with mustard dressed greens. Nik Williamson of The Porridge Cafe . The menu is currently being finalised but there will approximately be four breakfast toasties or 'melts' as they will be called, and six signature melts . The 12-seater cafe will also serve seasonal specials and 'hero melts' with unique cheeses. Melt Room follows on the heels of Old Street's Porridge Cafe, Simply Crispy in Belfast which serves crisp sandwiches and Brick Lane's Cereal Killer Cafe . The Porridge Cafe - from the founders of The Bow Street Kitchen Nik Wiliamson and Elly Harrington - opened in early March and serves 25 types of porridge made from 11 different grains. Prices range from £2.35 for a bowl of basic porridge to £7 for the more hearty versions, with meat and vegetable toppings. The cafe serves both sweet and savoury versions of the traditional breakfast dish. In December 2014 self-confessed cereal obsessives Alan and Gary Keery launched the UK’s first cereal cafe featuring 120 cereals, 20 types of toppings and 12 varieties of milk. The identical twins’ establishment opened in Brick Lane, London and offers a menu of over 100 cereals from around the world. The duo came under fire when they first opened their cafe, for charging £3.20 for a bowl of cereal. The single-item cafe movement is not just confined to London. Belfast's Simply Crispy which opened earlier in January was the brainchild of businessman Andrew McMenamin who had planned to keep his pop-up going for just four weeks. Alan and Gary Keery launched the UK’s first cereal cafe featuring 120 cereals, 20 types of toppings and 12 varieties of milk . Belfast's Simply Crispy which opened  in January is the brainchild of businessman Andrew McMenamin . But with diners queuing down the street to get their hands on the snacks, which have sold out every day, the cafe will now stay open and could even expand to other shops in Northern Ireland, Dublin, or London. 'We have managed to sell out every day - not the crisps though, the bread, the baps. We can't get our hands on enough fresh baps because everything flies out of the door,' Mr McMenamin said. Moo’d, opened by best friends Zoe Blogg and Jen Gibb in Leeds in February this year, offers 100 different cereals as well as ‘cocktails’ consisting of mixed varieties of different brands. Not wanting to be left behind, two rivals are racing to become Manchester's first cereal cafe. Black Milk Cereal Dive has confirmed it will open in Afflecks Palace this month, and according to Twitter, Cereal Central MCR is 'coming soon.' The acai berry is a rich purple palm fruit indigenous to the Amazon rainforest. For hundreds of years, these small dark berries have been integral to the diet of native Amazon people. The berries are packed with amino acids, as well as vitamins A, B, C and E and minerals such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper and zinc. The fruit perishes quickly after being picked, so to help preserve its goodness it is often made into acai berry juice, supplements or powder, which is often whizzed into a smoothie. According to some sites selling acai products, the berry's fibre and essential fatty acid content contribute to its ability to burn fat more efficiently, process food more quickly, cut down on cravings, and boost metabolism."
"A long, slow sigh sounded in the room. Then a consolatory hand on her shoulder. Shortly after, the sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach.
Canon Enid Morgan remembers the moment a bill to enable women to become bishops failed by three votes in 2008.
She was sat among the church's governing body in Lampeter, Ceredigion, when the result was announced.
""There was this feeling of 'we're going to carry on discussing this yet again',"" she recalled.
Ever since the first woman was made an Anglican deaconess in Usk, Monmouthshire, in 1884, women have been campaigning for greater equality in the church, fighting to prove they were capable of holding the same positions as men.
Just 11 years before the failed vote for bishops, the Church in Wales governing body had accepted women becoming priests by one vote in 1997.
Canon Morgan, of Aberystwyth, who was among the first 61 women to be ordained, said: ""There were women there who had been deacons for many years, I had been one for 12 years, so there was a lot of frustration.
""So much energy had gone into arguing the case which would have been better going into our work.
""Yet there was also the realisation this had not happened before and will not happen again. It was hugely important.""
Canon Morgan, now 76, has been among the ""lucky ones"" who has received much support over the years.
She was a lay reader for a decade and studied at the Theological College, Aberystwyth, before being ordained deacon in 1984.
She saw her ordination as a priest ""as a sign that times were changing"" and would later become director of the Board of Mission of the Church in Wales.
""I didn't have much in the way of humiliation or rudeness but some women got a rough ride,"" she said.
""Some bishops were very suspicious of us, some thought we might plot.
""If men and women can't get along in the church, then how are they expected to do so anywhere else?""
The move for women bishops would go on to be passed five years later, in 2013.
But the barriers women faced in the past still remain today.
As Revd Mary Stallard, of Llangollen, Denbighshire, said: ""The whole gender debate has a long way to go. Having women bishops is fabulous but it's not the end of the road in terms of how the church looks at gender.
""The decision-making committee for the finances of the church, for example, has 26 places on the representative body but only two are women.
""Yet if you look across Wales at who balances the books of households, I'm betting women are doing the lion's share.""
She and her husband Andrew were the first paid ordained couple in the Church in Wales before both becoming priests - she was among the first women in 1997 - and have gone on to achieve similar qualifications and experiences.
Yet Revd Stallard, a chaplain at an Anglican school, said jobs have been more readily offered to her husband while she has often been asked to work part-time or even without a salary.
When she found herself in a higher position than her husband, she said she had to ""argue that bit harder for it"".
""I hope we continue on a trajectory of change and if we are going slower in the church, it doesn't mean we won't catch up,"" she said.
""The future for the church is a struggle, but it would be less of a struggle if we stop fighting internally about matters like this.
""We are so much more empowered if we harness the powers of everyone.""
Both Canon Morgan and Revd Stallard hope the appointment of Canon Joanna Penberthy as Wales' first female bishop will inspire other women and open further opportunities in the church.
""It matters a great deal for the church, for women and for the women who died before their hopes were realised,"" Canon Morgan said.
""It's a wonderful feeling of completion but in fact it's only really the start."""
"The 27-year-old Frenchman played 29 times for Leyton Orient in 2016-17, as they were relegated from League Two.
He was out of contract, having joined the O's from Portsmouth on an 18-month deal in January 2016.
Atangana made his name in England with Havant and Waterlooville, winning their player of the year in his solitary season at Westleigh Park before joining Pompey in 2014.

""I think I need to apologise to my mum and dad because I may have caused a few less hairs,"" said Rutherford.
""I didn't get it right in the first two. Now I know where to start from on the runway you may see something good.""
Rutherford has won gold at his last four major championships and is the Olympic, world, Commonwealth and European long jump champion.
His progress maintained the possibility of a repeat of Super Saturday when he, Jessica Ennis-Hill and Mo Farah won gold on the same night at London 2012.
""It's going to be a very special evening and I'm excited,"" he added.

"Celtic could win the Scottish Premiership title against closest rivals Aberdeen on May 10 – if both teams win all their games beforehand. The Parkhead side face Kilmarnockat Parkhead on Wednesday night with the chance to go eight points clear. And winning their subsequent games – with Aberdeen doing likewise – could see Ronny Deila’s team win their fourth successive championship in the north east. Celtic will not play a Saturday league tie after the Scottish Professional Football League's announcement . The possibility emerged after the SPFL unveiled their post-split fixtures this morning. The Parkhead side have two Friday night fixtures against Dundee and St Johnstone – and won’t play another game on Saturday at 3pm this season. If Celtic wrap up the league flag they will be presented with the trophy before their final home game against Inverness Caledonian Thistle on May 24, the final day of the season. Aberdeen will play St Johnstone in their final game, with the top six completed by a Dundee derby. The Scottish Premiership leaders face nearest rivals Aberdeen at Pittodrie on Sunday, May 10 . The final round of bottom six ties could be held on the night of Friday May 22. The team which finishes eleventh will be consigned to a two-leg play-off against the winners of the Championship play-off. With St Mirren 10 points adrift at the foot of the table with just 15 points left to play for Motherwell will begin their quest to leapfrog Ross County out of the play-off spot with a local Friday night derby against Hamilton. The Fir Park side face Partick Thistle on the final day of the season, while St Mirren face Hamilton."
"The naked body of a 22-year-old Michigan woman who went missing while dressed as Poison Ivy after a Halloween party was found on Friday and police say evidence indicates it was a homicide. The Monroe County Sheriff's Office confirmed on Saturday the remains found on a 13-acre private property near a heavily-wooded site close to train tracks are those of Chelsea Bruck. The medical examiner's office in Wayne County used dental records to confirm the body is Bruck's. Chelsea Bruck (left) was last seen in Frenchtown Township, Michigan, while dressed as Poison Ivy (right) Investigators and volunteers had been searching for Bruck  and more than one million fliers were handed out . She was last seen on October 26 about 15 miles away from where the body was discovered in Ash Township . Bruck, of Maybee, disappeared after attending the party in Newport on October 26, about 15 miles away from where her body was discovered Friday in Monroe County's Ash Township. She was dressed as the fictional comic villain  at the party and was wearing a leaf-covered top and a dark purple wig. Her body wasn't clothed when workers found it while trying to free a dump truck from soggy soil. Chelsea's older brother Nathaniel said in a post on the Help Find Chelsea Bruck Facebook page: 'I want to thank everyone for their efforts. 'And while this may be the end of the search, it is also a new beginning; the beginning of the search for justice for my sister.' Monroe County Sheriff Dale Malone spoke to the media during a conference about the discovery of the body . Monroe County Sheriff Dale Malone said evidence collected at the scene indicated the death was a homicide, although a cause of death remains inconclusive, the Monroe News reported. He did not say if the police have any leads, but did say the property owner is not a suspect, according to the Detroit Free Press. Malone said at a news conference: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the Bruck family. 'In all likelihood, the crime was committed at or near where the body was located.' He added the killer likely 'was familiar with the railroad tracks that are there'. Michigan State Police were called to investigate the area in Ash Township where the body was found Friday . The Poison Ivy costume was found about ten miles away at an industrial site near Flat Rock earlier this month. Investigators and volunteers had been searching for Bruck since she disappeared and more than one million fliers about the missing woman were distributed. A witness told police about seeing Bruck in her costume around 3am the day she vanished, walking in the direction of where cars were parked. A man was with her. He was described as having dark hair, a thin mustache and facial hair. Witnesses said he wore glasses with a black hoodie. The cause of death could take up to a month to be determined due to the advanced decomposition of the body. Family and friends turned to public prayer in Monroe, Michigan last October after Bruck first went missing ."
"The United States is urging China to release five young feminists who face years in prison over their campaign for gender equality. Authorities detained the women in three cities -- Beijing, Guangzhou and Hangzhou -- a few days ahead of events planned for International Women's Day on March 8. ""Each and every one of us has the right to speak out against sexual harassment and the many other injustices that millions of women and girls suffer around the world,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement Friday. ""We strongly support the efforts of these activists to make progress on these challenging issues, and we believe that Chinese authorities should also support them, not silence them."" The detention of Wei Tingting, along with Wu Rongrong, Li Tingting, Wang Man and Zheng Churan has drawn harsh criticism from the international community. Protesters in several cities have called for their release and taken to social media with the phrase ""free the five"" as a hashtag. Wang Qiushi, the lawyer for Wei, said police recommended Monday that prosecutors press charges of ""assembling a crowd to disturb public order."" Prosecutors have seven days -- until Monday --  to decide whether to pursue the charges, according to the lawyer. ""We can do nothing but wait,"" Wang said. The five were initially held on suspicion of ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble."" Wang said he didn't know why the charge against the women changed. ""Neither should constitute a crime,"" he said. Campaign group Amnesty International said the new charge was less serious but still carried a maximum prison term of five years. ""The women were doing nothing wrong, nothing illegal. They were simply calling for an end to sexual harassment,"" said William Nee, China researcher at Amnesty International. Wang said that Wei was subjected to lengthy cross examinations during her detention. Two of the women are said to be in poor health. He added that the charges relate both to the activities the women planned for International Women's Day and earlier campaigns against domestic violence. The five are members of China's Women's Rights Action Group. They had planned to hand out stickers with slogans saying ""stop sexual harassment, let us stay safe"" and ""go police, go arrest those who committed sexual harassment!"" on International Women's Day. This week, Kerry's predecessor, Hillary Clinton, tweeted that the activists' detention was ""inexcusable."" Chinese authorities rebuked her comment, saying public figures should respect the nation's sovereignty and independence. CNN's Katie Hunt and Shen Lu contributed to this report ."
"German state prosecutors said they had found the man's number on the phone of Anis Amri, who killed 12 people by ramming a lorry into market shoppers.
Amri was shot dead by police in Milan early last Friday, four days on from the attack. The 24-year-old Tunisian had opened fire, wounding one.
Amri had links to known Islamists.
German prosecutors say a video in which Amri pledges allegiance to so-called Islamic State (IS) is genuine.
Government officials have said the lorry's automatic braking system may have prevented the loss of more lives on 19 December.
The system kicks in when it senses an impact and this may have cut the hijacker's rampage short.
Frauke Koehler, spokesperson for the federal prosecutor's office, said ""further investigations revealed that the detained man was not a contact person of Anis Amri's, therefore he had to be released"".
She said the pistol found on Amri when he was shot dead by Italian police last week had the same calibre as the one that killed the Polish driver whose truck Amri hijacked.
Lukasz Urban, 37, was killed by a gunshot to the head - apparently before the lorry was driven into the Christmas crowd at Breitscheidplatz, in central Berlin. His body was found in the cabin, after Amri had fled.
Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni told a news conference there was no evidence that Amri had any ""particular networks"" in Italy.
He was probably radicalised after arriving in Italy in 2011, Mr Gentiloni said.
Investigators are trying to piece together Amri's movements after the Berlin attack, when he was subject to a European arrest warrant.
There are indications that he travelled to Nijmegen in the Netherlands on 21 December and then took an overnight bus from Amsterdam to Lyon in France.
Then he took a train to Chambery in the French Alps, changed trains, and reached Milan. He was stopped by police in the early hours of 23 December near Milan's Sesto San Giovanni station."
"Didn't MPs vote against bombing Syria a couple of years ago? In the last few days haven't the prime minister and the chancellor made clear they would only take military action in Syria if there was a consensus here in the UK? In any case, isn't it entirely unusual, almost unheard of in modern times, for British military action to take the life of a British citizen?
The answer to all three of those questions is yes.
But just a couple of weeks ago, an unmanned British Reaper drone did drop a missile on a group of so-called IS fighters in Syria that killed two British citizens.
One, the target, Reyaad Khan, was according to David Cameron involved in plotting a barbaric attack on British soil. In the PM's view and, he says, the view of the government's most senior lawyer - the attorney general - that made the attack entirely proper and legal.
""There was a terrorist directing murder on our streets and no other means to stop him,"" the PM said. Although we've been told repeatedly British drones have been flying over Syria to carry out surveillance, in the small print the government always retained the right to act in extremis without specific permission from MPs.
For Number 10, that action is distinct from its decision on whether to take military action and have RAF pilots join US forces flying bombing missions over Syria. The prime minister still wants to persuade MPs to back that plan this autumn, although a vote is unlikely until after the party conference season wraps up.
But this strike does add a sense of urgency to those making the arguments for intervention - a reminder that so-called IS plan and plot in Syria, that the direct threat to the UK is real and getting more serious.
But there are calls tonight from opposition politicians for more information and reassurance on the particular circumstances around this attack, accusations already that the strike is evidence of British ""mission creep"".
As the operation appears to have been led by intelligence the truth is we may never know what really happened, what the precise circumstances were.
But the fact that we know a British plane has dropped a British bomb in Syria, on British citizens may mean, earlier than expected, the battle lines in this debate are drawn."
"baby's weight, length and date of birth confirmed with an official insignia. The difference here is the governing authority's stamp: The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. It's one of many official documents relating to matters such as vaccination schedules, fishing methods and rent disputes in the areas now controlled by ISIS. For ISIS sees itself as a government operating under a rule of law, even if the group is most often talked about for its barbaric punishment of anyone who resists or defies its medieval interpretation of that Islamic law. The ISIS documents, some shared with CNN by researcher Aymenn Al-Tamimi, give a window into the bureaucracy of the self-declared caliphate. Last summer, ISIS fighters swept through the Iraqi city of Mosul. Once they took power, leaders wanted to show they could bring stability allowing daily life to resume. So, they quickly reopened the University of Mosul, albeit under a radically altered curriculum. Notices went out that classes would resume on 24 Dhu al-Hijjah 1435 in the Islamic calendar (or October 18, 2014, in the Western calendar), about four months after ISIS overran the city.

"John Clancy, Labour councillor for Quinton, beat closest rival Penny Holbrook in Monday night's ballot.
Ahead of the vote, he said providing new homes and improving existing social housing should be the authority's ""top priority"".
He will officially replace Sir Albert Bore on 1 December.
Mr Clancy, who has bid to become leader of the city council several times, was chosen in the ballot by the authority's 78 Labour councillors.
Updates on this story and others on Birmingham and Black Country
Sir Albert announced he would stand down as head of the self-styled ""largest local authority in Europe"".
A close call for a man waiting in the wings for more than a decade.
John Clancy has become leader of the Labour group after five attempts - and by just one vote. He will officially become leader of Birmingham City Council on 1st December when it's ratified at full council.
An English teacher for many years, he's no stranger to working in the public sector but he also had a spell as a solicitor, as well as a business lecturer.
His big message at a hustings last week was the council under his leadership can provide smarter financial decisions, political openness and free school meals for all primary age children.
Some critics from within the party are already saying they're worried he won't have the clout or the vision to make the huge and rapid improvement needed to keep government commissioners at bay.
The former Labour group leader's departure followed two other senior party figures, who resigned after criticising the way city was being run.
Ian Ward, the deputy leader of the local authority and councillor Barry Henley also stood for the position.
Mr Clancy, a former teacher and lecturer, has also pledged to widen access to free school meals for primary school children and expand regeneration outside the city centre.
Birmingham City Council has found itself under scrutiny from a government-appointed independent panel.
The panel was appointed at Sir Bob Kerslake's recommendation to oversee changes at the council.
Sir Bob's study was commissioned after a series of reports focussed on the council during an inquiry into the so-called Trojan Horse letter."

"As Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne is used to inventing new ways of hovering up taxpayers’ money to clean up the deficit. Mr Osborne today came face to face with a real Henry the Hoover – and onlookers couldn't fail to notice there was an uncanny resemblance to the Tory campaign chief. The Chancellor met his house-cleaning doppelganger at a campaign stop in Somerset, where he was given a tour of the factory where the machines are built. Uncanny: Chancellor George Osborne met George the Hoover as he campaigned in the West Country . The blue version of the popular vaccum brand, which also shampoos carpets, was unveiled during Mr Osborne's visit to the Numatic factory in Chard, Somerset . Mr Osborne appeared to be amused by a Henry Hoover as he spoke to staff on the production line . Mr Osborne was seen cracking up after posing for photographs with the iconic hoover brands. Onlookers could not help noticing the striking similarities between the grinning, plastic cleaning device – and the Chancellor. Mr Osborne was shown round the factory by worker Inga Ciplyte, 29, from Exeter, as he promoted the Government’s plan to create thousands of new apprenticeships. The Chancellor took to Twitter to hail the Henry the Hoover factory, writing: 'Great British products made here in Chard and exported around the world.' David Cameron had earlier been joined by the TV star Karren Brady to highlight a series of deals with big businesses to create 16,000 new apprenticeships over the next five years. The Conservative peer, who stars as one of Lord Sugar's sidekicks on The Apprentice, joined the Prime Minister at a Costa Coffee - after they announced plans to take on 6,000 youngsters as part of the Tories' pledge to eradicate youth unemployment. Baroness Brady, who is also the government’s small business ambassador, said apprenticeships ‘transformed’ people's lives and were now more respected than in the past. Earlier Mr Osborne tried his hand at being a mechanic as he met  apprentices at Hawkins garage near St Austell . The Tories announced an extra 16,000 apprentices would be created by firms including Morrisons and Costa . Mr Osborne even got the teas in as he campaign for local Tory candidate Steve Doble (left) Mr Cameron has pledged to create three million more apprenticeships over the next five years, if the Tories win the election. Costa Coffee and supermarket chain Morrisons have signed agreements to train thousands of apprentices each. Ministers will today visit firms across the country to welcome fresh commitments from companies including Morrisons, who will train 9,000 apprentices; Crest Nicholson, who will take on 200 and announce a new training academy; and the National Grid, who will take on 500 new apprentices. Ahead of their campaign visit today, Baroness Brady said: ‘David Cameron’s commitment to delivering more apprenticeships is a fantastic boost for the long-term prospects of our young people.' She added: ‘With 2.2million starting since 2010 and another 3million more to start over the next five years, each apprenticeship is a chance for young people to master a trade, learn on the job and take home money in your pocket each week. ‘They’ve become more rigorous and respected too: we’ve got young people building engines for jet planes, working on massive engineering projects, innovating in science labs.’"
"Instead of The Big Bang Theory and How I Met Your Mother, viewers tuning in on 7 May will see ""Darren"", the man in charge of keeping E4 on air, sitting in the channel's control room.
It is believed to be the first time a UK channel has closed on polling day.
E4 is one of the most popular youth channels on television, reaching 8.7 million 16-34 year olds every month.
Its regular schedule will be suspended from 07:00 BST, when polls open, to 19:00 BST, when the channel will return to normal with Hollyoaks (polling closes at 22:00 BST).
Dan Brooke, Channel 4's chief marketing officer said: ""Less than half of under-25s voted at the last election so we've engaged the most powerful weapon that we have at our disposal to try and boost that number - switching off their favourite TV channel for the day.""
A pre-election advertising campaign, running on all of Channel 4's stations, will alert viewers to the reason for E4's absence.
The adverts will ask viewers: ""How many times have you missed life-changing events because you wanted to watch your favourite show?
""May 7 is election day and Darren is going to turn E4 off so you might as well go and vote. You won't forget will you Darren?""
However, viewers will only be able to use the switch-off as an excuse to vote if they have already registered - and the deadline has already passed.
Meanwhile, Channel 4 will present an ""alternative"" to the election night coverage on the BBC and ITV, with a programme co-anchored by Jeremy Paxman and comedian David Mitchell.
Paxman, who left BBC Two's Newsnight last June, said: ""Elections matter. But that doesn't mean the coverage has to be dull. I hope there'll be room for both insight and laughter.""
David Mitchell added: ""Our aim is to keep people watching much later than they intended and we will be judged by the dip in the nation's productivity on Friday 8 May.""

"Joey's Pizza has 212 stores across Germany with annual sales of â‚¬143m ($156.5m; Â£103.9m).
Germany is the world's fourth-biggest pizza market and the deal is worth up to A$120m ($86m).
The deal will increase the number of stores owned by Sydney-listed Domino's Pizza Enterprises to 1,870.
The joint venture will be two-thirds owned by the Australian company, with the remainder owned by the London-listed Domino's Pizza Group, which already has operations in Germany.
Don Meij, chief executive of Domino's Pizza Enterprises, said that entering the German market represented a long-term growth opportunity.
""The acquisition of the market-leading Joey's Pizza business provides immediate scale and marketing presence which we can build from,"" he said.
The company's Sydney-listed shares jumped more than 12% after the deal was announced. The stock has soared more than 125% in the past 12 months.
The Australian company also raised its profit outlook for the year to June by 30% -  to A$166.1m net income before tax and other items.
The Domino's brand globally is owned by the New York-listed Domino's Pizza Inc.
The London-listed company has more than 800 stores in the UK, and holds franchises in Ireland, Germany and Switzerland. Up to 15 of its German stores will be bought by the joint venture.
Shares in Domino's Pizza Group have risen by 38% this year and the company is valued at Â£1.6bn.
Domino's Australia is the world's largest franchisee for the pizza brand. It holds the Domino's brand network in Australia, Belgium, France, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Monaco.
The Joey's Pizza deal is expected to be completed early next year, subject to regulatory approval."
"Turner, who spent nine years as a player with Posh before winning back-to-back promotions as manager in the early 1990s, was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia in 2006.
His wife Lynne previously said doctors told her the illness was ""caused by heading too many balls"".
Turner also played for Cambridge United, Luton, Swindon and Southend.
He started his playing career at Peterborough in 1969 and made more than 300 appearances.
His playing career also included time in the US.
Turner retired as a player in 1984 and took over as boss at Cambridge United a year later, managing them until 1990.
His successful reign at Peterborough ended in 1992, when he stood down to become chairman.
Mick Halsall, who captained Peterborough to victory in the play-off final in 1992, said Turner was a ""great, great leader"".
""He had a great ability to nurture,"" Halsall said.
""[We were] a bunch of scallywags who achieved so much, and in my opinion wouldn't have achieved it under anyone else.""
Bob Symns, Peterborough chief executive, said Turner was ""a legend who'll never be forgotten"".
John Beck, who was brought to Cambridge as a player by Turner in 1986 and went on to take the club to the brink of the Premier League as manager, said Turner was a ""very lovable man"".
""I'd gone to meet the manager at Peterborough and I was going to sign, but then I got a phone call from Chris,"" he said.
""I went down to the Abbey (Stadium) and knew instantly that this was the man I wanted to sign for.
""He was just a wonderful person. Great warmth, great fun, great personality."""
"One of the few women to receive a mention is Marie Curie, a physicist and chemist who basically discovered radiation and helped apply it in the field of X-rays.
She won two Nobel Prizes, in physics and chemistry. Yet even so, she was turned down for membership of the prestigious French Academie des Sciences in 1911, the very year she went on to win her second Nobel Prize.
The Nobel laureate Sir Tim Hunt was heavily criticised for his disparaging remarks about women in science last week, which for some raised the issue of where women stood in the scientific community.
The larger truth is that women have made big and important discoveries in science - think of Dorothy Hodgkin, the brilliant crystallographer who mapped the structure of penicillin and went on to be awarded a Nobel Prize in 1964.
Hodgkin was the first woman to win the prestigious Copley Medal, and she remains the only British woman to have won a Nobel in the sciences. Yet at the time, the newspapers carried headlines such as ""Oxford housewife wins Nobel"".
But many female scientists in the past were not given the credit they deserved for their achievements. As a result, their names have all but disappeared from public consciousness.
Here are just a few.
Esther Lederberg, a microbiologist, conducted groundbreaking research in the field of genetics.
She developed basic techniques that have gone a long way towards helping scientists understand how genes work.
Her work helped her husband, Joshua, win a Nobel prize in 1958, but she was not cited in the award.
The British biophysicist Rosalind Franklin was a pioneering X-ray crystallographer.
Her image of the DNA molecule was critical to deciphering its structure - one of the biggest and most important scientific breakthroughs of the 20th Century - but it was James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins who received the 1962 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for their work.
Ida Tacke made huge advances in both chemistry and atomic physics.
It was she who managed to find two new elements, rhenium and masurium, that Dmitri Mendeleev had predicted would form part of the periodic table.
She gets credit in the science books for the discovery of rhenium.
But masurium is now known as technetium, the discovery of which is attributed to Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segre.
Tacke's evidence was ignored until Perrier and Segre artificially created the element in a laboratory.
Tacke is also credited with being the first person to open up the idea of nuclear fission.
Lise Meitner's work in nuclear physics led to the discovery of nuclear fission - where atomic nuclei split in two.
This laid the groundwork for the atomic bomb.
After moving to Berlin in 1907, Meitner collaborated with chemist Otto Hahn over many decades.
But Hahn published their findings without including Meitner as a co-author.
And he went on to win the 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his contributions to splitting the atom.
Chien-Shiung Wu was one of the most important physicists of the 20th Century.
She participated in the development of the atom bomb, as part of the Manhattan Project. Yet few know her name today.
In the 1950s, two theoretical physicists, Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang, asked Wu to help disprove what is known in physics as the law of parity.  Wu's experiments turned this law on its head.
This landmark moment in physics led to a 1957 Nobel Prize for Yang and Lee, but not for Wu, who was left out despite the key role she played.
Another neglected pioneer is the astronomer Henrietta Leavitt, who helped change the way we see the universe.
She began her work by measuring and recording stars at the Harvard Observatory - one of the few jobs in science that was considered suitable for women.
Leavitt spotted a pattern between the brightness of a star and its distance from the Earth.
This led her to uncover what is known as the period-luminosity relationship, allowing scientists to calculate how far away a star was from Earth based on its brightness.
The Royal Society - swift in its condemnation of Sir Tim's remarks - was founded in 1660 and has yet to elect a female president.
It represents the scientific establishment in the UK, and its early members included Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke.
Women were not permitted to become fellows until 1945, almost 300 years after its foundation.
Some say that the comments from Sir Tim - a prominent fellow of the society - will damage the efforts it is making to improve diversity.
It has been reported that only 6% of its fellows - a prestigious title in the world of science - are women.
That statistic, some say, sums up the scale of the wider problem of the difficulties faced by women in the scientific world."
"Ministry of Defence figures show there are currently 81,700 full-time servicemen and women in the Army, down from 102,260 in 2010.
More reservists are being recruited but that process has been slow.
Former commander Richard Kemp said it showed the plan was ""incoherent"" but the MoD said the Army had the ""manpower we need at the moment"".
Col Kemp, a commander of British forces in Afghanistan, told the BBC News website: ""To have already made the cuts by 2015, it shows confusion and targets that don't match up... it doesn't mean it's a good thing.
""The whole plan was to cover the gaps with reservists, but if you've not achieved that then it must mean that we have got deficiencies.
""Not only does that cause us concern about how we govern our people, but it is also the message we are sending to our enemies. That kind of message always shows aggression towards us.""
Plans to increase the number of Army reservists from 19,000 to 30,000 by 2019 have been controversial.
As of April 2015, the number of trained reservists was at 21,030 - an increase of just over 1,000 since April 2012.
Former chief of the defence staff General Lord Richards has referred to the plan as ""a brave experiment"", while John Gearson, professor of national security studies at Kings College, London said: ""I think it is accepted that the recruitment programme has underperformed.
""With the absence of a major conflict maybe they will come through... It is a calculated risk.""
According to recent statistics from the MoD, the trained strength of the UK's armed forces is at 143,200, down from 176,600 in 2010.
Cuts began after the government's strategic defence and security review called for a restructure - dubbed Army 2020 - to help reduce the UK budget deficit.
The Army has cut more than 20,000 jobs well ahead of the 2018 target.
The other services have also already exceeded their targets for job cuts, with the RAF losing 8,500 personnel and the Royal Navy cutting more than 5,500 posts since 2010.
An MoD spokesman said: ""This government is committed to an army of 82,000 and the funding is in place to deliver it.
""We have the manpower we need at the moment and, working with the army, we are taking clear action to keep driving recruitment upwards.""
Shadow Defence Secretary Vernon Coaker said the shortfall in Army reservist recruitment was a ""real concern"".
""The figures need to be looked at again within the context of Strategic Defence and Security review in the autumn. If there is shortage of capability, clearly it needs to be addressed,"" he said.
Former Defence Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said: ""If they have achieved what they set out to do then that must be satisfactory.
""The government had to have a strategy to deal with the economic situation. It was always going to be challenging to increase reserves at the same time.
""Will it be achieved? I think the jury is still out on that.""
Prof Keith Hartley, defence economist from the University of York, said he believed the government targets for the Army had been realistic post the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
""It is perfectly sensible, but we must also realise that we have a lower defence capability,"" he said.
""We can't fight in as many wars and conflicts. We must look at the alternatives like the use of air power to replace boots on the ground as well as technology like drones.""
In 2014, MPs on the defence select committee warned there were shortages of specialist personnel in the Army and Royal Navy that were leaving the military ""vulnerable"".
A lack of nurses, intelligence operators and qualified engineers were among those highlighted.
In response, ministers said restructuring had led to ""temporary shortages"" in some areas but frontline operations were being protected.
Earlier this month, Chancellor George Osborne ended months of speculation when he announced the government was committed to spending 2% of national income on defence for the whole of the next decade.
But Prof Malcolm Chalmers, from the defence think tank RUSI, said retaining military personnel would be tougher in the future.
""Historically, military pay has risen in line with trends in the private sector, but that's not been happening since 2010 and the decision to limit pay rises to 1% each year means that this falling behind in pay levels is going to continue,"" he said.
""The problem of the future will be less that of redundancy as whether the armed forces can recruit and retain the best people.""
Sir Nick Harvey, former Liberal Democrat Armed Forces minister agreed.
""David Cameron has said in bold terms the Army would not go below 82,000 during his term... But I do think it will be much harder to recruit in the future. Now the economy is picking up, opportunities may be much better outside the forces.
""The fact the Army may not be doing as many interesting things may also have an impact."""
"A homeless shelter manager was allegedly killed by a former resident who tried to rape her at gunpoint and them shot her as she ran away naked, according to police sources.

"Loren Davis was driving at 100km/h (62mph) on an expressway in Adelaide on Tuesday when she hit the koala as it was crossing the road.
Ms Davis only discovered what had happened to the animal when she reached home and inspected her car.
The koala only had minor abrasions and will be released into the wild soon.
""We're calling him Bear Grylls,"" said Ms Davis, whose choice of nickname was inspired by the British survival expert and television presenter.
Koalas, which are often mistaken for bears, are in fact marsupials.
Ms Davis told reporters that she had been driving down a dark stretch on the expressway and only saw the koala when her headlights illuminated it.
She said she could not change lanes nor brake because of traffic next to her and behind her, and had ""no choice but to hit the koala"".
She later pulled to one side to check but could not see the koala anywhere.
Ms Davis drove to her home about 10km away, ""feeling upset that I'd killed a koala,"" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).
""Once I got home and pulled into the garage I turned on the light to see the damage. I turned around, saw a koala and just screamed.""
The koala was still conscious and growled as Ms Davis approached. She and her fiance finally pushed a blanket underneath its dangling arm so that it could push itself up and out of the grill.
Animal rescue volunteers later came by and took the animal for treatment. It is expected to be released soon.
Fauna Rescue co-ordinator Merridy Montarello told The Advertiser newspaper in Adelaide that it was a ""very, very lucky koala"".
""It's because of the particular size of it [that it survived]... It's just sat itself inside the car.""
""Bear Grylls"" is not the only koala to have a lucky escape on Australia's roads.
Another koala got stuck head-first in a car grill three weeks ago when it was hit on a road in another part of Adelaide, reported ABC.  In 2011, a koala named Kenny in Queensland also survived under similar circumstances.
In 2014 a koala named Timberwolf survived a 54.5 mile (88km) ride clinging to the bottom of a car, also in Queensland.
However, not all koalas are so lucky - according to some estimates, about 85% of koalas involved in road accidents may die from their injuries."
"The university said the move at Singleton Park was ""precautionary"".
South Wales Police received a call at about 13:30 BST after concerns about the safe storage of chemicals before a controlled explosion took place.
Nobody was injured and a police spokesman said a cordon erected was precautionary while the chemicals were removed.
Student Alex Jones said there was ""some panic"" at the start of the incident and lectures were moved away from the area to other buildings.
South Wales Police said the incident was not treated as suspicious and there was no risk to the public.
The university said the controlled explosion was carried out by the Royal Logistics Corps bomb disposal unit after the chemicals ""had become unstable""."
"For any hopeful parent who wants to know what life is really like with a newborn baby, never fear, a clever mom has filled a void on the internet by providing a wide range of hilarious spoof reviews seemingly written by frustrated owners displeased with their young baby children. Raquel D'Apice, a comedian and mother-of-one from New Jersey, has put her own personal spin on crowd-sourced assessments by creating Yelp Reviews of Newborns, an entertaining collection of spoof critiques that highlight the real struggles plaguing new parents today. Raquel, who posts the reviews on her humorous parenting blog The Ugly Volvo, told Today that she came up with the idea of the parody posts after she was searching for something on Yelp and realized that there were reviews for everything except babies. Funny mom: Raquel D'Apice, pictured with her son, created Yelp Reviews of Newborns, an entertaining collection of spoof critiques that highlight the real struggles plaguing new parents today . Not happy: NotLovingIt wrote that she wished she 'had read the reviews' before deciding to have a baby . And just like the website that inspired it, Yelp Reviews of Newborns was written from the perspective of fictional parents who have ranked their individual experiences with their babies by giving them a star rating out of five. 'Calling this a disappointment is an understatement,' fictional reviewer HavntSlept, from New York City, wrote before she complained about the 'long grueling hours', lack of pay and the 'unnatural amount of stress' that comes with being a parent. The new mom, who gave motherhood one star out of five, added: 'If I could give it zero stars I would.' Meanwhile, NewMom417, from Guttenberg, New Jersey, noted that her 'extremely long wait' of more than nine months was 'unacceptable' before she went on to graphically describe her delivery. 'First off, gross. There's a reason the brochures don't show you how the baby gets out of your body because that whole party is disgusting,’ she wrote.' Filled with joy: The comedian and mother-of-one from New Jersey can be seen with her smiling baby . Not recommended: NewMom417 gave a detailed list of all the reasons why she was unsatisfied with her newborn . After she continued to voice her complains about 'set up and calibration', as well as 'user experience', she advised hopeful parents not to waste their time. Less than a week after NewMom417's review was 'posted', her newborn baby responded with a 'Message from Proprietor'. 'We understand that people often come to this with unrealistic expectations (not your fault and we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused,' the message read. The baby ended the posting by saying: 'Sorry for the inconvenience (we know, it can be difficult) but please hang in there and best of luck in the upcoming months. Thanks for your patronage!' And while Raquel used her experiences has a mom to write the clever rankings, they're not all bad. In fact, some of the Yelp Reviews of Newborns reviewers she created can't stop gushing about what a joy it is to have children. KidsRMyJam, from Long Island City, New York, gave her newborn give out of five stars. So disappointing: Meanwhile, HavntSlept complained about the 'long grueling hours' dedicated to her baby before noting that she would have given her baby 'zero stars' if she could . Happy camper: The reviewer KidsRMyJam called parenthood the 'greatest experience ever' 'Greatest experience ever. So worth it - like your life beforehand was two dimensional and suddenly having a child allows you to experience a third dimension,' the satisfied customer wrote, before adding: 'We've done it twice and would be happy to go back.' OvrTheMoon, from Southport, Connecticut, agreed, writing: 'This newborn is my entire reason for living and has brought such meaning to my life in a way nothing else has.' Meanwhile, Raquel's other fictional parents advised others to stick it out. Manhattan-based dad ThnxButNoThnx wrote: 'Sorry not a fan' on his one star review in 2014, but a year later he came back to edit his original post. 'OK. Still give the newborns one star, but it's been a year now and I'm actually really into this,' he added. 'For those of you who don't like it, give it time. It totally gets better. Raquel, who worked as a stand-up comedian for 10 years before she had her son, transferred her humor over to her parenting blog when she no longer had time to perform in comedy clubs. '[The blog posts] are just kind of about having a child in general and not having [my son's] entire childhood documented,' she told Today. 'It is just about kids … I am bringing up things I think [parents] have in common.'"
"The magnitude-4.8 quake struck at a depth of 15.5km (9.6 miles) 35km north of the city of Lucca, officials said.
The tremor was felt as far away as Milan and Florence, Italian media say. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.
Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region.
Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana.
Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area.
Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage.
In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena.
In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said.
Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage.
Alessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor ""came out of nowhere"", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - ""medium-strong"" and ""fairly shallow"".
Italy is still trying to recover from the aftermath of the deadly earthquake in L'Aquila.
Six scientists and an ex-official were convicted of multiple manslaughter in October 2012 for giving a falsely reassuring statement.
The group, all members of the National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Serious Risks, were accused of having provided ""inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory"" information about the danger of the tremors felt ahead of the 6 April 2009 quake.
At a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely.
On the night of the quake, many people are said to have remained in their homes and died because of the advice, while others who had decided to remain outside in the street survived."
"The candidates were responding to a question about proposed changes to health care in Staffordshire at a debate run by BBC Radio Stoke.
They were asked about a consultation by clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) which buy health services in the area.
The consultation is looking at reducing bed-blocking and improving efficiency.
Ian Wilkes, for the Liberal Democrats, told the debate, at St George's Centre in Newcastle, health care and care in the home were not ""joined-up"".
""When you come out of hospital there should be care ready and waiting,"" he said.
Phil Wood for UKIP, said at the moment too many people in the NHS were ""trying to protect their own budgets and let someone else have the problem"".
He said his party would put £3bn a year in to stop ""[its] creeping privatisation"".
Replying, Sam Gibbons, the Green Party's candidate, claimed UKIP leader Nigel Farage had said he would like a private-style health care system.
Mr Gibbons said cuts had meant managers at hospitals, including his mother who was a nurse and ward manager, still provided clinical care alongside ""heavy workloads"".
Labour's Paul Farrelly said the first question should be ""what does the individual need?"" and not ""whose budget is it coming from?"".
Questioned on Labour's objection to plans for the tendering of NHS cancer and end-of-life contracts across Staffordshire, he claimed the area was being used as ""a guinea pig for further creeping privatisation"".
Tony Cox, parliamentary candidate for the Conservative Party, said his party recognised ""there needs to be better integration"" between health and social care but the move had been hampered by ""some reluctance"" from councils and some NHS departments.
""But locally this year Staffordshire County Council have this year invested another £20m into social care which is where we've realised the pressures are actually happening,"" he said.

"Jailed: Jordan Sim-Mutch posted pictures of stolen money and drugs on Facebook after targeting businesses across Greater Manchester . A 24-year-old man who carried out a series of raids on petrol stations and convenience stores has been jailed after boasting about his crimes on Facebook. Jordan Sim-Mutch posted pictures of stolen money and drugs on the social networking site after targeting businesses across Greater Manchester. The career criminal, who claimed he worked in 'midnight removals' in his online profile, was part of an armed gang responsible for 29 robberies and burglaries. Sim-Mutch, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, was jailed yesterday after admitting to a string of offences at Minsull Street Crown Court. On Wednesday night, hours before he was sentenced, Sim-Mutch uploaded a picture taken inside the courtroom that shows he and his fellow gang members in the dock. The photograph of the smirking men - which is now being used as the criminal's 'cover picture' on Facebook - was illegally taken by a friend in the public gallery. A number of supportive comments have since been left on the image, with one saying 'love you Jord' and another posting 'lads on tour'. The court was told the gang carried out a series of armed raids on petrol stations, convenience stores and a pub to pay for cannabis. The men used a number of stolen cars fitted with false licence plates, including a BMW and an Audi A5, to use as getaway vehicles, it was heard. They targeted businesses in groups of four, armed with a variety of weapons including bricks, baseball bats, a meat cleaver, axes, and, on one occasion, an imitation firearm. Three men would enter the premises and hold up staff as the fourth remained in the car. Prosecutor Adam Smith told the court that on one occasion, the men stole nearly £4,000 worth of cigarettes and £1,000 in cash from a BP garage in Bredbury. In another robbery, three of the group walked into a pub and threatened customers with a meat cleaver. Mr Smith said: 'A customer was threatened and told to ""get in the back"" towards the rear cash office where there was a safe. 'One was threatened with the cleaver and two took the member of staff to the office where they were forced to open the safe before they took £2,000.' The gang were involved in 29 robberies and burglaries across areas of Stockport and Greater Manchester. The men were first caught in November 2013, but were granted bail by the courts. When they re-started the operation in February last year, the gang had to carry out their crimes during the day because they were subject to curfews and electronic tagging orders. The gang were caught after police, suspecting they were behind a spree of recent robberies, started to monitor them. Sim-Mutch pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob, conspiracy to commit burglary, conspiracy to steal and conspiracy to possess an imitation firearm. The career criminal, who claimed he worked in 'midnight removals' in his online profile, was part of an armed gang responsible for 29 robberies and burglaries. Above, a photograph posted by Sim-Mutch . The court was told the gang carried out a series of armed raids on petrol stations, convenience stores and a pub to pay for cannabis.

Prosecutor Adam Smith told the court that on one occasion, the men stole nearly £4,000 worth of cigarettes and £1,000 in cash from a BP garage in Bredbury. Above, Jordan Sim-Mutch in photos posted online . Mitigating, his barrister Simon Morton said he was not a member who ordered victims to the floor because he suffers with a stammer. Explaining why he got involved in the enterprise, Sim-Mitch told him: 'Well I'm just a big daft lad, aren't I?' Mr Morton said: 'He goes on to say there is no excuse for what he did. This is a big mistake, a long time in jail for a poxy bit of money.' Sentencing Judge Timothy Mort said: 'These are premises in the local community - local to you - where people are providing a valuable service for you and your neighbours and friends and family. They targeted businesses in groups of four, armed with a variety of weapons including bricks, baseball bats, a meat cleaver, axes, and, on one occasion, an imitation firearm. Above, a photograph posted by Sim-Mutch . Sim-Mutch, pictured, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob, conspiracy to commit burglary, conspiracy to steal and conspiracy to possess an imitation firearm. He was jailed for nine and a half years yesterday . 'Normal people who go to the pub and go to the shop. They are providing a valuable service in your community and it is your community you have been targeting. 'When one analyses conspiracies it is straight forward enough. Worryingly simple offences are being committed. 'If it was a vulnerable convenience store, three would go in, get cigarettes, the till, wave something at staff and run for it. Easy money. 'Mr Sim-Mutch, he would get a call saying ""do you want to take part?"" There were more than enough happy to do it if you didn't want to take part.' Getaway driver Paul Edwards, 34, who had offences or robbery stretching back to 2001, was jailed for nine-and-a-half years. Tyler Quinn, 22, was jailed for eight-and-a-half years. Aaron Bell, 18, was jailed for seven years. Ben Fredricks, 23, was jailed for nine-and-a-half years. Paul Huskie, 23, who stored the 'robbers' kit' in his flat, was jailed for three years. The gang, all from Stockport, admitted conspiracy to rob."

Englishman Willett ended one over the cut line on seven over after shooting 78 in blustery winds that made conditions tricky at the Georgia course, although most players did find scoring easier than on the opening day.
Only two players - Hoffman and compatriot William McGirt - shot under 70 on Thursday, but seven men managed the same feat  in the second round - including Garcia, Fowler and Pieters.
""I felt like I played great, I felt like I hit the ball better than the first day,"" said Garcia, the world number 11.
""The course is still very difficult, and I made a couple of stupid mistakes but I can be happy because of the way the course is playing,"" he added.
Garcia has been one of the game's leading players since bursting onto the European Tour scene as a teenager, consistently hovering in and around the world's top 10 and challenging for leading honours.
But his failure to win one of the four majors, after several near misses in 22 top-10 finishes, is a blemish on an otherwise stellar career.
Two impressive rounds at a blustery Augusta have left him well-placed to shake off the unwanted tag of being one of golf's most famous 'nearly men'.
Garcia made a flying start to his second round with birdies on the first three holes before dropping his first shot of the tournament on the fourth.
Then came total confusion after a mistake on the Masters scoring system.
Garcia scored a bogey on the par-four 10th, but it was changed on the scoring system to a triple-bogey seven - dropping him down the leaderboard.
The mistake was eventually rectified by tournament officials about an hour later, moving him back into tied second and two behind Hoffman.
Two more birdies at the 15th and 17th wiped out Hoffman's lead, although the Ryder Cup stalwart missed a six-foot birdie putt on the last to take the outright clubhouse lead.
""I've shown myself many times that I can contend and I truly feel I can not only win one major, but more than one,"" said Garcia.
On the scorecard mix-up, he added: ""I saw it on the leaderboard on the 13th but the main thing was I knew where I stood.""
Hoffman, 40, caused a shock when he shot a stunning seven-under 65 to lead on Thursday but, unsurprisingly, the Californian was unable to replicate this remarkable feat.
His round was ruined by five bogeys in six holes around the turn, although he recovered to birdie the 13th and stay in the hunt.
""Any time this place firms up, it plays its hardest just because it's hard to control your golf ball,"" said Hoffman, who has only previously claimed one top-25 finish at a major.
Belgium's Pieters - considered one of the rising stars on the European Tour - moved into contention with another impressive showing on his Augusta debut.
The 25-year-old began the day level and, after bogeying the first, stormed back with three birdies and an eagle on the 15th.

Fowler, two groups behind Pieters, set the tone by holing his bunker shot for an eagle on the par-five second and adding a birdie on the next. He rolled in three more birdies to record the day's lowest round.
Two-time major winner Jordan Spieth birdied three of his last six holes to finish level par alongside two other former Masters champions, Adam Scott and Phil Mickelson.
In three appearances at the Masters, American Spieth has finished second, first, tied for second.
World number two McIlroy, 27, is aiming to become only the sixth man to win all four majors - at his third time of trying at Augusta.
McIlroy, who has three consecutive top-10 finishes in Georgia, is seeking a first Masters title following victories at the US Open and the Open Championship and two US PGA Championship titles.

He shot a scrappy level-par 72 on Thursday and followed up with a similarly-scruffy round on Friday.
He struggled to find rhythm in a card littered with five bogeys, salvaging four birdies to keep him within touching distance.
However, McIlroy felt aggrieved to walk off the 18th with a bogey after his approach shot hit the flagstick and bounced off the green.
""The shot at the last looked like a tap-in birdie and I made five. I got two bad breaks with hitting the pin and the wind then caught me out on the putt as well,"" he said.
""It was another day where you had to battle, make a lot of pars and pick off the odd birdie here and there.
""I feel I can put a 31 or 32 together a couple of times over the weekend and get closer to the leaders.
""Hopefully these are the toughest conditions we have played in and hopefully I can go a lot lower over the weekend.""
England's Danny Willett became the first Briton to win the Masters in 20 years when he claimed his first major 12 months ago - this time there was no cause to celebrate ending another barren run.
The Yorkshireman, 29, is the first defending champion to miss the cut since Canada's Mike Weir in 2004.
Willett began the day at one over par, but his second round got off to a shocking start when he recorded a quadruple-bogey eight on the first.
Two more bogeys arrived at the fourth and 11th holes, in addition to a solitary birdie at the 10th, leaving him perilously close to missing the projected cut of six over.
And a bogey on the 18th pushed him to seven over par.
""We've had two fabulous years and then you have a little bit of a downturn and it feels like the world is coming to an end,"" Willett said.
""Playing Augusta at the weekend would be nice with the good weather coming in, but we had that in our own hands and unfortunately we let that slip.""
Other big names who missed the cut include reigning Open champion Henrik Stenson, plus former Masters winners Bubba Watson and Zach Johnson.
Seven other Britons - Chris Wood, Tommy Fleetwood, Russell Knox, Ian Woosnam, Tyrrell Hatton, Sandy Lyle and amateur Scott Gregory, plus Ireland's Shane Lowry - also failed to make the weekend.

Twelve months after Bernhard Langer rolled back the years at Augusta, another veteran former champion is dreaming of a fairytale finish.
Fred Couples, who won the Masters in 1992, is three shots behind the leading group after shooting a two-under-par 70.
The 57-year-old former world number one is now ranked 1,893, but showed that experience counts for everything at Augusta.
The American carded six birdies during a round punctured by a double bogey and two bogeys, and almost holed his approach on the 18th but walked off with a tap-in birdie.

""I feel like I can play the course well but in conditions like this I feel I have a better chance than if it was sunny and less windy,"" he said.
""It would be hard for me to shoot a 68 like some of the better players. In bad weather I feel I could battle.
""The only real disappointment was my second on 17 which led to a bad bogey.""
Another former winner, 58-year-old Larry Mize, became the oldest player to make the cut at six over par on the 30th anniversary of his 1987 victory."
"Drilling threes on the buzzer is all good as far as Cleveland Cavaliers superstar LeBron James is concerned - the buzzing of drills at the dentist is a whole other story. The 11-time All Star brushed off rough treatment from the Chicago Bulls as his Cavs won on Sunday by saying it's the sort of thing NBA stars should expect come this stage of the season. 'It's April,' James shrugged. But the self-titled King James' talk wasn't so tough as he paid a second visit to the dentist's chair in a fortnight, as shared with his 9.3 million followers on Instagram. 'Back at the dentist and I'm hearing a bunch of drilling going on behind me from my docs so I had to sit up like, ""What the heck is going on back there."" Hahaha but seriously what's up. #DentistNightMares,' he wrote in his latest chronicle from the dentist's chair. LeBron James posts an image of himself not especially pleased with the buzzing of drills at the dentist . The 11-time All Star led his Cleveland Cavaliers to victory over the Chicago Bulls on Sunday . LeBron delivered his first triple-double for Cavs as they won a 50th game of the campaign and 18th straight at home in their march towards the playoffs. He contributed 20 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists, and one more if he claims credit for telling Kyrie Irving to shoot a 52-foot three on the buzzer at the end of the third quarter. James came crashing back to earth in the room filled with drills and sharp implements on Monday though after his on-fire Cavs accounted for the Bulls with some impressive shooting from outside at key moments proving the difference. On Sunday night LeBron's rival Joakim Noah was less than hospitable with a heavy foul or two. But the 30-year-old was more bothered by the man in the white coat and his assistant. LeBron delivered his first triple-double for Cavs as they beat the Bulls for their 50th win of the season . James also takes some credit for telling Kyle Irving to shoot a three from 52-feet on the third quarter buzzer . James (right) got the better of his rival Joakim Noah (13) during a physical encounter on Sunday . His dentist confession  comes two weeks after his last tooth-related post in which the four-time NBA MVP took a selfie as a series of instruments were put to work inside his mouth. 'So is this why folks say they hate Monday's!!???' he wrote at the time. Last year, after claiming his second NBA title, he was less subtle simply saying , 'Someone please help me, PLEASE #DestistakaBoogieMan.' The Cavaliers are flying high with four games to play until the post-season having already confirmed their playoff place behind Atlanta in the Eastern Conference and as winners of the Central division, ahead of the Bulls.

Mae'r Church Times hefyd yn cyfeirio at e-bost arall y mae'r papur yn credu gafodd ei anfon gan Esgob Llanelwy, Y Gwir Barchedig Gregory Cameron.
Mae'r e-bost yn dweud: ""Dw'm yn meddwl bod ganddo unrhyw bleidlais esgobol (?) ac yn bendant nid yw'n denu etholwyr Llanelwy.

Ym mis Ebrill cafodd June Osborne, Deon Caersallog ei dewis yn esgob newydd i Landaf wedi i'r Coleg Etholiadol fethu dewis olynydd i'r Parchedicaf Ddr Barry Morgan ym mis Chwefror. Ddydd Sadwrn cafodd ei chysegru yn Aberhonddu.
Mewn cyfweliad ar raglen Bwrw Golwg ar BBC Radio Cymru ddydd Sul, bydd Jeffrey John yn dweud bod y ""cynllun"" honedig yn ei erbyn wedi llwyddo.
Dywedodd: ""Llwyddodd y cynllun, er imi gael bron deuparth o'r pleidleisiau, ac er bod yr etholwyr yn Llandaf yn unfrydol am fy apwyntio i.
""A thra bod yr esgobion yn fficso popeth yn gyfrinachol, yn gyhoeddus roedden nhw datgan cyn, yn ystod, ac ar ôl yr etholiad, nad oedd dim rhagfarn a dim rhwystr i bobl hoyw o gwbl yn yr eglwys.

Wrth gael ei holi am agwedd yr Eglwys tuag at hoywon dywedodd Y Gwir Barchedig John: ""Gallwch chi fod yn ddidwyll ond eto'n twyllo eich hun.
""Dwi'n derbyn wrth gwrs bod llawer o Gristnogion yn credu'n ddiffuant, ar sail y Beibl, fod hoywder yn bechod.
""Y broblem yw dehongli y Beibl yn ei gyd-destun gwreiddiol, a gwneud hynny yn onest ac yn gyson.
""Y cwestiwn felly dwi eisiau ofyn yw pam fod cymaint o Gristnogion yn dal i gondemnio hoywon, ond ar yr un pryd yn derbyn - er enghraifft -  ysgariad, neu ordeinio merched?
""Pam mae nhw'n dehongli'r Beibl yn llythrennol mewn un achos, ond ar bynciau eraill mae'n nhw'n derbyn dehongliad llawer mwy rhyddfrydol? Mae'r anghysondeb braidd yn amheus, on'd yw e?""

""Mae pawb yn gwybod fod llawer o offeiriaid ac esgobion yn hoyw, ond yn gyfrinachol.

"James May has been forced to backtrack for suggesting Top Gear viewers who sent threatening tweets to Sue Perkins should 'kill themselves'. Perkins, who became a favourite to replace the ousted Jeremy Clarkson after a flurry of bets, recently announced she was leaving Twitter  as a result of the horrific abuse. In response, May said: 'If you're one of the people sending death threats to Sue Perkins, could you please do the world a much bigger favour by killing yourself.' The presenter quickly clarified: 'Obviously I don't actually want people to kill themselves but, really, we don't want them as fans.' James May (right) backtracked on his comment that Top Gear viewers who sent threatening tweets to Sue Perkins (left) should 'kill themselves' May is currently getting ready to tour a Top Gear spin-off around the UK alongside Clarkson and Richard Hammond, following the BBC's sacking of Clarkson for punching a producer. They will be stripped of all BBC branding and instead be presented as 'Clarkson, Hammond and May Live', meaning the show will not be able to use clips from Top Gear - or even feature the Stig. May's comments were made after Perkins finally decided to take a break from Twitter in response to the barrage of abuse. She had earlier stated: 'Guys, post the utterly fabricated story about me and Top Gear, my timeline has been full of blokes wishing me dead. This morning, someone suggested they'd like to see me burn to death. 'All of which goes to say that I am off Twitter for a bit. Love and peace x.' The Great British Bake Off host was said to be the front-runner for the job, according to bookmakers Coral, with Dermot O'Leary second favourite at 2-1. Actor Philip Glenister, famed for his role as the detective in Life On Mars, has also been rumoured to replace the ousted Clarkson. The Bake Off star denied the rumours, resulting in a torrent of abuse from Top Gear fans. Perkins said on Twitter last week: 'Just back from night shoot in Kolkata sewers to find my timeline busy with middle-aged man-trolls. General gist: Man do cars, woman do cake.' Jeremy Clarkson, pictured here smoking and looking tired in London this week, attacked one of the Top Gear producers . Clarkson was the subject of an internal BBC investigation after he attacked Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon, splitting his lip and verbally abusing him in a 30-second assault on March 4. He was suspended by the broadcaster on March 10 before it announced his contract would not be renewed. The star received widespread public support - including from his friend Prime Minister David Cameron - in the aftermath of the fracas, and one million people signed a petition calling for the BBC to reinstate him. But director-general Tony Hall said 'a line has been crossed' and 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'."
"An Italian model who accused Harvey Weinstein of groping her breasts and putting his hand up her skirt attended the Hollywood mogul's new Broadway show just a day after his alleged attack. Ambra Battilana, 22, told police Weinstein asked her for a kiss and then groped her during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan on Friday night. However, the very next day she snapped a picture of her matinee ticket to a preview showing of Finding Neverland, which Weinstein is producing, from the Lunt-Fontanne Theater and posted it on her Instagram. Scroll down for video . Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein groped her during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan on Friday night . The next day she snapped a picture of her matinee ticket to a preview showing of Finding Neverland, which Weinstein is producing, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater and posted it on her Instagram . Sober: Directly after the show, Battilana posted a picture of an empty glass of water from the Tribeca HOtel where the NYPD picked up Weinstein very soon after . A movie industry source said Weinstein gave Battilana the $227 sixth-row-center-seat ticket during their Friday night meeting and told her he would be backstage during the show . A movie industry source told Page Six Weinstein gave Battilana two $227 sixth-row-center-seat tickets during their Friday night meeting and told her he would be backstage during the show. The source said: 'Why would she go, knowing he was nearly 100 percent likely to be there?' Indeed, directly after the show, the beauty queen uploaded another picture to her Instagram feed. Battilana posted an empty glass of water from the Tribeca Grand Hotel, from where cops took the movie supremo in for questioning a short time later. This has led some to speculate that the 22-year-old tipped off the NYPD as to Weinstein's movements and was actually waiting to see them apprehend him. Weinstein, 63, was questioned by the NYPD this weekend and denied Battilana's allegations. A source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted that the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'. Surveillance footage from outside the Tribeca office is being analyzed, according to police sources. Weinstein, 63, has denied Battilana's allegations. The married father of five was reportedly interviewed by the NYPD Special Victims Squad on Saturday after going to the police precinct voluntarily . Battilana previously told Italian authorities she witnessed a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010 . Weinstein, a married father of five, was reportedly interviewed by the NYPD Special Victims Squad on Saturday after going to the police precinct voluntarily. No charges have been filed and he has promised full cooperation with the probe. 'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said. Battilana previously told Italian authorities she witnessed a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010. She claimed she had seen young models performing stripteases and baring their breasts to be kissed by the Italian leader during a raunchy dinner party. It was revealed that Battilana also alleged to Italian police in 2010 that she was 'forced against' her will into having sex for money with a 70-year-old 'businessman of substantial means'  when she was underage. Battilana met the wealthy car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy, according to Italian newspaper reports. It was revealed that Battilana also alleged to Italian police in 2010 that she was 'forced against' her will into having sex for money with a 70-year-old 'businessman of substantial means' when she was underage . The age of sexual consent is 14 in Italy but it is illegal to pay for sex or to have sex with a prostitute who is under the age of 18. In her police statement, she said the man invited her into his car, where he then caressed 'my hand and left leg' and proposed 'that I become his ""playmate""'. Battilana said he then gave her a bag with €2,000, before assuring her it was only 'an advance of the €5,000 he would give me every month'. She added: 'Despite the indecency of the proposal, both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money. Battilana began her professional modeling career after competing in the Miss Italia beauty pageant and works internationally in Milan, London, Paris and New York . Harvey Weinstein seen with a smile on his face as he enters his office building in New York City on Tuesday . The relationship ended after she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant. Battilana posted a picture that showed seats at the Spring Spectacular in Radio City Music Hall, where she reportedly met  Weinstein on Thursday . Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal - although it is likely it would have been carried out. In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that Miss Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable to verify her claims. Marcello Cassano, a fashion photographer and ex-boyfriend of Miss Battilana, told the Daily News that the legal battle was probably the reason they broke up. 'That's probably why we ended,' he said. 'She's a victim of her beauty.' He added: 'She's a good person, but she suffered so much.' After becoming famous through the Miss Italia pageant, Battilana began modeling professionally in 2011, according to social media. She works internationally in Milan, London, Paris and New York. The 22-year-old recently shot an editorial campaign for Bambi magazine in Agent Provocateur lingerie. She established a new Twitter account on Monday and posted the message: 'Don't stop Dreaming just because you had a Nightmare.' The Manhattan District Attorney has yet to decide whether charges will be filed against Weinstein. The DA's office declined to comment to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online on Tuesday. Weinstein reportedly first met the former Miss Italy contestant the night before the alleged attack at his New York Spring Spectacular show in Radio City Music Hall. The 22-year-old model posted a picture on her Instagram account from Radio City Music Hall on Thursday night. The pair exchanged emails and arranged for Battilana to come in to his office for an audition and to 'talk business'. Ambra Battilana gave previous statements to Italian authorities after claiming she had been invited to one of ex-Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi''s now infamous orgies at his Milan mansion in 2010. In statements she told investigators: . Weinstein has been married to his second wife, 38-year-old fashion designer Georgina Chapman, since 2007. The couple have two young children together . Weinstein, who is originally from Queens, New York, founded Miramax studio with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200 million. He is married to British-born fashion designer Georgina Chapman, 38, who founded the luxury label Marchesa. The couple have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter. Weintein also has three older daughters from his first marriage to his former assistant, Eve Chilton, which ended in 2004. The Hollywood heavyweight skipped the New York premiere of his latest movie, Women In Gold, at the Museum of Modern Art on Monday night. The alleged groping took place on Friday at the Weinstein Company offices in Manhattan (pictured) where Battilana had met Harvey Weinstein to 'discuss business'"

"The Mercedes driver did a sensational lap to beat title rival Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari, who was on top form himself, by 0.242 seconds.
Hamilton was 0.541secs ahead of team-mate Valtteri Bottas, who was third ahead of Kimi Raikkonen's Ferrari.
Max Verstappen headed team-mate Daniel Ricciardo to an all-Red Bull third row.
The key to Hamilton's pole was arguably a stupendous effort through the middle sector of the lap at the demanding Spa-Francorchamps track in the Ardennes mountains.
The Ferrari had been quicker than the Mercedes through sector two throughout the weekend but Hamilton pulled something out of the bag on his final run to set the pace there by 0.2secs.
Afterwards, F1 sporting boss Ross Brawn delivered a message from Schumacher's family. Brawn said: ""His wife Corinna said that Michael always believed records were there to be broken, and they want to offer their congratulations.""
Schumacher has not been seen in public since the skiing accident in 2013 that left him with severe head injuries and in a coma for some months. His family have consistently said his recovery will be long and hard and have given no other news of his condition.
""It's a special day,"" said Hamilton. ""I knew it was on the horizon and knew I'd get the 68th pole, but I haven't thought about it much.
""But now being there it is an unusual place to be. I remember coming here in 1996, my first grand prix, and watching Michael come by and the engine vibrated my rib cage and that was when my love for the sport took another step.
""And I have now equalled him on poles and it is very surreal. It is a humbling experience knowing Michael is such a legend. It is an incredible feat he achieved and I am very proud to be up there with him.
""To be able to put a lap together like that is a dream. I have the best job in the world. It's a pleasure to be here.
""To hear the message Ross just gave, I have to say a big thank you. I followed Michael and raced against him and always admired him. My prayers are for him and the family and he will always be one of the greatest of all time.""
As good as Hamilton's lap was, Vettel's was equally impressive.
The German had been struggling for pace for much of the weekend compared to team-mate Kimi Raikkonen and was half a second down on Hamilton after the first runs in the top-10 shootout.
When Hamilton reduced his own time by a further 0.354secs on his final run and Bottas popped up in second place ahead of Raikkonen, Vettel appeared to have problems.
But he produced his own mega-lap to join Hamilton on the front row.
""It was the right lap at the right time,"" Vettel said, adding that he had been helped by a slipstream from Raikkonen in the final sector, where the German set the fastest time of all in a part of the track where Mercedes have dominated all weekend.
The stage is therefore set for a titanic battle between the two title rivals in the race, which Vettel starts 14 points ahead of Hamilton.
Behind the Red Bulls, Renault's Nico Hulkenberg was seventh, a place that appeared set to occupied by his team-mate Jolyon Palmer.
The Englishman, who has had a difficult start to the season, had the edge on Hulkenberg all day and was seventh in the second part of qualifying.
But he suffered a loss of gearbox oil pressure on his out-lap at the start of Q3 and pulled off track in a cloud of smoke.
Palmer will thus start 10th, as the final Q3 runner, behind the Force Indias of Sergio Perez and Esteban Ocon.
McLaren's Fernando Alonso was 11th, bemoaning a loss of power on his final lap in Q2.
McLaren had used team-mate Stoffel Vandoorne, who has a 60-place grid penalty for engine and gearbox transgressions, to 'tow' Alonso to try to compensate for the Honda engines lack of power on both his runs.
Alonso was 10th after his first run but on his final lap, which looked set to be quicker, the engine lost hybrid energy deployment between Pouhon and Stavelot and he had to abort the lap.
""No power, no power,"" he screamed over the radio. But after getting over the frustration he said it was a generally positive weekend because 11th with choice of tyres might be better for the race and that the car had been surprisingly competitive on such a power track.

It was a dire day for Williams, whose drivers Felipe Massa and Lance Stroll both failed to progress beyond the first knockout session.
Massa ended up 16th and Stroll 18th, the Canadian denied a second attempt to make it into Q2 when Williams ran out of time to change a damaged rear-wing endplate.

"Ann Clwyd criticised Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, claiming Owen Roberts died ""like a battery hen"".
Although that and 20 other allegations out of 31 were not upheld, the independent investigation did find he died of hospital-induced pneumonia.
Ms Clwyd maintained she would be ""vindicated"".
Results of the review show nine of her allegations were entirely upheld and one partially.
But 17 were rejected, 11 were not upheld due to insufficient evidence and two were rejected because of insufficient information.
A second independent review is now taking place to examine the findings.
Among the upheld allegations in the report were responses to the following comments by Ms Clwyd:
However, those allegations not accepted by the investigation included claims by Ms Clwyd:
Other allegations not accepted included ""almost every request I made was ignored or dismissed"" and ""I saw a nurse in the corridor and asked her why my husband wasn't in intensive care. She just said, 'There are lots worse than him'"".
Up until now, the results of the investigation - carried out a year ago - went unpublished.
But parts of the report were released under a Freedom of Information request.
Ms Clwyd told BBC Wales the report summary should not have been made public, especially while another investigation is under way. She disputed there was insufficient evidence for her claims, and said she had additional evidence.
She said: ""I think that when the other investigation is concluded then my views will be substantially vindicated.""
By Tomos LivingstoneBBC Wales political correspondent
This case has led to a huge political row.
We ended up with the extraordinary situation of a Labour MP, Ann Clwyd, being criticised by the Labour First Minister, Carwyn Jones, for failing, in his view, to provide evidence to back up her claims.
At the same time, we recently had the Welsh Conservative Party conference in Llangollen and delegates there standing and applauding Ann Clwyd for the work she had done campaigning for better standards of care in the health service.
There is a general election of course coming up next year - health care standards are already a central part of that campaign, not least perceived differences in standards between Wales and England.
So we are going to hear a lot more about the political row this case has caused and we are going to hear a lot more about the individual case itself, I think, with a second investigation now on its way.
The health board has denied breaching confidentiality and said the details released were statements already in the public domain.
A health board spokesman said: ""We would like to make quite clear that the health board has not released the full report and it is not our intention to breach any confidentiality.
""The investigation into Ms Clywd's concerns was overseen by an expert independent panel and completed in April 2013. Since then the health board has received a number of requests under Freedom of Information legislation to release that report. As part of that standard process Ms Clwyd's permission was sought to release the full report but that was refused.""
The spokesman said it sought legal advice before releasing the summary.
He said: ""Based on that advice the health board believes it would be in breach of its statutory duty not to release the summary report.""
The release of the report summary follows a dispute between Ms Clwyd and the Labour Welsh government.
First Minister Carwyn Jones has told Assembly Members the MP provided ""unattributable"" comments about the NHS that ""can't be investigated"".
But Ms Clwyd insisted she had provided Mr Jones with a comprehensive summary of complaints raised.
Ms Clwyd led a UK government-commissioned inquiry on how NHS hospitals in England handle complaints and said she also received hundreds of letters from Welsh patients outlining poor experiences they had suffered."
"One of the biggest fixtures on the German footballing calendar takes place this weekend, although some of the usual gloss has been taken off a game recently baptised Der Klassiker. Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich have shared the last five Bundesliga titles between them and Bayern are set to continue their domestic domination this term. This time, however, the two giant antagonists of the German game meet with 31 points and nine positions separating them in the standings, but that does not mean the stakes are not as high as they always are when these two clubs meet. Jurgen Klopp (centre) celebrates with his Borussia Dortmund players after their victory against Hannover . Dortmund are now only five points from the top six having climbed their way from the foot of the table at the midway stage of the season to 10th, although their coach Jurgen Klopp insists their league position after the Klassiker is not his biggest concern. 'We've got to try to beat Bayern and where that can take us in the league is secondary,' Klopp said. 'Although we're 10th, and although there's a huge points gap between us, and although a lot is different compared to the past, it's still a Borussia Dortmund home game. 'I don't recall us gifting any of these games in the past. Dortmund's Jakub Blaszczykowski (right) challenges Hannover centre back Christian Schulz . 'Gladbach have shown us how it's done. Wolfsburg have also beaten them, but it's not all that easy.' Victory would nevertheless be important for Dortmund if they are to close the gap on the top six and qualify for Europe next season, while a second consecutive defeat for Bayern is almost unheard of and it would allow Wolfsburg to reduce the deficit at the top to seven points. The Wolves host bottom-placed Stuttgart on Saturday while third-placed Borussia Monchengladbach can strengthen their grip on a place in the Champions League with a win at Hoffenheim. The battle at the bottom of the table is intensifying with all of the bottom eight sides separated by just seven points and still in danger. Xabi Alonso cuts a cool figure during Bayern Munich's training session on Thursday . Hamburg reacted to their slide into the bottom three by appointing Peter Knabel as their new coach during the international break and his first game is a daunting trip to fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen. The northern Germany side therefore risk coming out the other side of the weekend inside the bottom two with Paderborn travelling to Hertha Berlin on Sunday. Freiburg and Cologne are also involved in that scrap and they meet on Saturday with Mainz travelling to Werder Bremen. Elsewhere, Augsburg host Schalke on Sunday and Eintracht Frankfurt welcome Hannover and their under-fire coach Tayfun Korkut to the Waldstadion."
"The party has been carrying out ""one final round"" of vetting to determine who is eligible to stand in the race.
UKIP donor Arron Banks suggested Steven Woolfe will not be on the ballot.
Mr Woolfe's candidacy is in officials' hands after he missed the deadline and revealed he did not disclose a drink-driving ban when he stood to be a police commissioner in 2012.
Also in the race are MEPs Jonathan Arnott and Bill Etheridge, while Huntingdonshire councillor Lisa Duffy and activists Phillip Broughton and Elizabeth Jones have also put their names forward.
There is continued uncertainty about whether prominent MEP Diane James has applied.
The contest has been sparked by Mr Farage's decision to stand down following the UK's vote to leave the EU, saying his ""political ambition has been achieved"".
The vetting panel had been expected to announce on Tuesday which candidates were eligible to stand under the party's rules after nominations closed on Sunday.
But after the panel met it issued a statement saying the final list of leadership candidates would be revealed on Wednesday at midday.
""An NEC-led panel has today met to determine the eligibility of those candidates that submitted their nomination papers to stand for party leader.
""That panel has now met and with one final round of checking to go the party aims to announce the full list of candidates at midday tomorrow, Wednesday 3 August,"" a party spokesman said.
To qualify, candidates are expected to have been party members for two years and to have been nominated by 50 members of the party.
UKIP leadership: Runners and riders
Steve Crowther, who left his job as UKIP chairman earlier this week, would not be drawn on whether Mr Woolfe - seen as the frontrunner in the race - should be excluded from the contest for submitting his papers 15 minutes late - a delay that the MEP has blamed on computer problems.
But asked about the issue of the drink-driving conviction - which Mr Woolfe incurred in 2002 but which he did not reveal when he stood to become a police and crime commissioner in 2012 in a possible breach of electoral law - he told the BBC that this was ""arguably more serious"".
Mr Woolfe got a Â£350 fine and nine-month ban for being drunk in charge of a scooter but insisted his life had moved on by 2012 and the conviction was spent by then.
Amid reports of a power struggle within the party, UKIP NEC member Victoria Ayling tweeted on Tuesday evening to urge her fellow panel members not to ""block"" Mr Woolfe.
UKIP donor Arron Banks later tweeted: ""Tonight's decision to exclude Woolfe is the final straw"" and he claimed it represented a ""coup"" by UKIP MP Douglas Carswell and Neil Hamilton, UKIP's leader in the Welsh Assembly.
Mr Hamilton - who is backing MEP Mr Arnott for the role - has said Mr Woolfe should not be able to run for the party's leadership if his nomination was submitted late.
Meanwhile, Mr Carswell, the party's only MP, has said he will not be endorsing any of the candidates but suggested they needed to consider what UKIP's purpose was after the EU referendum, how it should go about increasing its elected representation and how the party's leadership style needed to change."
"Arsenal are the form team in Europe at present, winning 10 games out of their last 11, including seven in a row. Their recent success can probably be explained by a number of reasons. Players have returned from injury at the right time, Olivier Giroud can't stop scoring, Hector Bellerin and Francis Coquelin have emerged, while Arsene Wenger seems to have found his drive once again. But could there be something else? With the Gunners preparing for the Premier League trip to Burnley on Saturday, one of their partners Europcar have revealed how some of the first-team stars motivate themselves on the team bus with some interesting and uncharacteristic selections included. Arsenal players have revealed their ultimate pre-game playlist ahead of their Premier League tie with Burnley . Olivier Giroud selected Coldplay's 'Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall' as his selected track . For instance, who would have guessed Giroud was a Coldplay fan? And can you picture Laurent Koscielny nodding along to Pharrell Williams' hit 'Happy' before defending at Turf Moor? And that's not all. Nacho Monreal opts for Dance DJ legend David Guetta's lead single from his sixth album 'Dangerous', David Ospina will even find time for some Colombian rap with J Balvin's track 'Tranquila' pre-game. Santi Cazorla has been in sparkling form in recent months with his languid style of creating from deep. So it is perhaps no surprise that the Spanish playmaker opts for something a bit softer - with pop singer from his homeland Melendi giving the 30-year-old all he needs before setting foot off the bus. Cazorla's track choice may be slightly more old school, but that's nothing compared to Theo Walcott. The England forward is obviously Loungin' before games with his selection of LL Cool J's 1996 summer hip-hop tune, which doesn't quite posses the fast pace we expect from Walcott on the pitch. Santi Cazorla's style of music seems to suit him - selecting Spanish pop star Melendi's slow track . Nacho Monreal appears to be a fan of up-beat dance music, opting for David Guetta track 'Dangerous' Laurent Koscielny may prepare for defending at Turf Moor by listening to 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers, Danny Welbeck, Aaron Ramsey and Kieran Gibbs are the youngest players on the list, so it is perhaps no surprise they go for recent and more mainstream hits. Phillip George's house track 'Wish You Were Mine', Macklemore's smash record 'Can't Hold Us', 'End Credits by drum and bass duo Chase and Status (ft Plan B), the Arctic Monkeys' indie toe-tapper 'Arabella' and Royal Blood's 'Figure It Out' are there respective selections. The light-hearted activity is designed to bring fans closer to their heroes, giving an insight into day in the life of a Premier League footballer before an important game. 'As Arsenal's official car and van rental partner, we wanted to bring travelling fans closer to their heroes so they can be inspired by the player's ultimate playlist which will get them fired up for another important game this weekend,' explained Ken McCall, Managing Director, Europcar UK Group. 'It's certainly an eclectic playlist. 'We wish Arsenal the very best of luck in the match.' Burnley are desperate for three points at the bottom of the table, while the Gunners are looking to keep their faint title chances alive with a win in the Saturday evening fixture. Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina selected a rap song from his home country - J Balvin's 'Tranquila' Theo Walcott opted for a 1996 summer jam - LL Cool J's laid back R&B song 'Loungin''"
"A rescue Sato named Bonnie is so afraid that she will be abandoned again that she can't bear to eat alone. In an adorable video posted to YouTube by user Jeannine S. with nearly one million views, puppy Bonnie can be seen lifting her dish to bring it over to her canine friend Clyde who is also scarfing down a meal. Bonnie lifts the dish into her mouth and scuttles her paws backwards to dine along with Clyde. Given a dish: Bonnie's new owner feeds her a dish of food away from his other dog Clyde . Clyde continues to focus on his plate and isn't bothered by his new company and from the sound of their names, it sounds like they might become partners in crime-or 'pawtners' in dog speak. Bonne was rescued from Puerto Rico and is a Sato, which means mixed breed or street dog. Due to extreme poverty, the streets of Puerto Rico are overwrought with thousands of abandoned dogs. Luckily for Bonnie she's no longer one of them, she'll have food on her plate, and she won't have to eat alone ever again. Wait for me!: Bonnie is so afraid to eat alone that she grabs her dish and paws her way over to Clyde . That's better!: Bonnie and Clyde eat together and it seems as though the two dogs may become partners in crime for life ."
"A photo of a baby boy being pulled from the rubble of the Nepal earthquake has become the defining image of a disaster that has devastated the country. His tiny face is coated in dust from the debris that crashed around him as the earth shook on Saturday, April 25, killing more than 5,000 people and injuring at least twice as many more. His name is Sonit Awal, and he's just four months old. On Saturday, Sonit was at home in Muldhoka, Bhaktapur, east of the capital Kathmandu, when the 7.8-magnitude quake sent tremors through Nepal and neighboring countries, according to Kathmandu Today. The house collapsed, burying the child, leaving his father Shyam Awal frantically searching for him amid the rubble. A desperate Awal called the Nepalese Army, and they too scrambled through the dirt and debris until midnight, before giving up hope and leaving. Sonit's father had lost all hope of finding his son alive, the paper reported, until he heard faint cries from below. On Sunday morning, the soldiers returned and at 10 a.m they lifted Sonit clear of the fallen rocks, beams, bricks and dust that had trapped him for 22 hours. His rescuers held him high in their hands to the sun, though his eyes were still wedged tightly shut. Sonit's face was exposed during the whole ordeal, though a hooded top and shawl protected his head and body during the cold night spent under rubble. The baby was taken to Bhaktapur Hospital and found to be uninjured; . His unlikely rescue provides some hope to a country that has experienced so much loss."

A black and white photo of the publication's Manhattan headquarters takes pride of place, with the strapline #lastprintissue.
The nod to Twitter is regarded as a backhanded compliment.
The death of the print edition was caused by falling advertising revenues, as audiences moved online.
From the new year, Newsweek will be a digital-only publication. Editor Tina Brown described it as ""a new chapter"" for the magazine.
In a defiant editor's letter, she wrote: ""This is not a conventional magazine, or a hidebound place.
""It is in that spirit that we're making our latest, momentous change, embracing a digital medium that all our competitors will one day need to embrace with the same fervor.
""We are ahead of the curve.""
Ms Brown became editor of the publication two years ago, after it merged with The Daily Beast, a news website she co-founded in 2008.
Newsweek's first edition was published on 17 February, 1933. It made an immediate splash with its front cover, featuring seven photos - one news story for each day of the week.
Although it always took second place to its rival, Time, it  gained prominence in the 1960s for its coverage of the civil rights movement.
At its height, it had a circulation of 3 million, but declining readership and advertising revenue saw it fall into losses.
It was sold by the Washington Post Company to businessman and publisher Sidney Harman for $1 in 2010, and was merged with the Daily Beast three months later.
Ms Brown is a former editor of Vanity Fair and The New Yorker. She unveiled Newsweek's final front cover via Twitter, saying: ""Bitter sweet! Wish us luck!""
One reader commented that the hashtag headline was ""like using your final breath to ID the killer"".
The move to a digital edition will allow Newsweek to cut costs such as printing, postage and distribution. However it will lose money from print advertisers, who traditionally pay more than their online counterparts.
As the final edition went to the printers, The Daily Beast confirmed it would be making many of its editorial staff redundant."
"Mila Kunis is being sued by a Ukrainian wannabe singer who claims the Hollywood actress 'stole her pet chicken' as children. Kristina Karo alleges that she was a classmate of Ms Kunis, 31, who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1991,  and that the pair were 'inseparable'  growing up. Karo, now living in Los Angeles, claims a seven-year-old Ms Kunis had been 'envious' of her pet hen, and that 25 years ago, she stole it from her. Bizzare lawsuit: Wannabe singer Kristina Karo  claims the theft of her pet chicken as a child in Ukraine traumatised her, and is now suing 'thief' Mila Kunis for $5,000 . In her lawsuit, Karo states that Ms Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine where she lived, and play with the hen, called 'Doggie', TMZ reports. She alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Ms Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm', the website states. Karo, who has moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer, says the theft of her pet chicken  traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist. She claims that being in close proximity to Ms Kunis, who lives in Hollywood with partner Ashton Kutcher and daughter Wyatt, has 'brought back all the bad memories' and she now needs therapy again. Bad memories: The reason for the lawsuit 25 years after the 'theft' is that moving to LA, which is where Kunis also lives, has brought back memories of losing 'Doggie' for Karo and forced her back into therapy . Not a bad egg: Mila Kunis, seen here with partner Ashton Kutcher in Los Angeles, is being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from Karo . In her suit, Karo alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm' (stock image) Karo, whose song Give Me Green Card has more than 70,000 views on YouTube, is suing the actress Kunis for $5,000 for emotional distress and to cover her therapy bills. She also claims the theft of 'Doggie' 25 years ago has 'prevented her from pursuing the American dream', according to TMZ. Interestingly enough, Karo's self-penned online bio describes her as being 'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven. Wannabe: 'Singer' Kristina Karo says she and Kunis were inseparable in first grade, but that the actress was jealous of her pet chicken 'Doggie' and stole the hen ."
"Simmons, 52, was suspended in September for questioning the continued omissions of Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard.
He issued a public apology to the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB).
""I regret my public outburst during a press conference and the revelation of the vote that took place at the selection meeting,"" said Simmons.
""I extend a public apology to all whom I may have offended. I have personally apologised to my fellow selectors and the WICB and now do so again publicly.
""I am looking forward to putting this behind me and doing the job I enjoy with the West Indies' senior men's teams.""
Simmons played 26 Tests as an all-rounder for the West Indies between 1988 and 1997, and became head coach of their senior squads in March.

"A 116-year-old Arkansas woman passed away on Monday just six days after she was announced as the oldest living person in the world. Last week Gertrude Weaver, who was already the oldest person in America, asked President Barack Obama to attend her birthday party on the Fourth of July. The Silver Oaks Health and Rehabilitation Center in Camden, where Weaver was a resident, confirmed her death and said they were 'devastated by her loss'. Scroll down for video . Gertrude Weaver, the world's oldest person, died at 116 on Monday in Camden, Arkansas . Weaver passed away from complications due to pneumonia, according to KATV. Kathy Langley, the center's administrator, said Weaver was enjoying the spotlight she received in the last week of her life, she told Reuters. The staff read Weaver the many news articles written about her after she became the oldest person in the world. Weaver inherited the title last Wednesday, after the death of 117-year-old Misao Okawa in Japan, according to the Los Angeles-based Gerontology Research Group. She attributed her long life to treating others well and eating her own cooking. 'I treat everyone the way I want to be treated,' she told reporters. Weaver, who received a letter from Obama on her 116th birthday, said she wanted to meet the president at her birthday party because she voted for him twice. Weaver attributed her long life to treating others well and eating her own cooking . While living at Silver Oaks, Weaver exercised in her wheelchair three times a week and ate three meals a day at the facility's dining room. Weaver was born on July 4, 1898 in Arkansas. She was the daughter of sharecroppers and worked as a domestic helper. After retiring, she lived with her granddaughter. Weaver moved to Silver Oaks in 2009 when her granddaughter had health problems, according to Langley, who called her an 'absolutely amazing lady'. Weaver became the world's oldest person on Wednesday following the death of Misao Okawa in Japan(left) who died at the age of 117. American Jeralean Talley, 115, (right) is now the world's oldest person . Weaver's 93-year-old son visited her on a regular basis. Jeralean Talley, of Detroit, is now the world's oldest person, according to the Gerontology Research Group. Talley was born on May 23, 1899 and will turn 116 next month. She bowled until she was 104 years old and never smoked or drank alcohol. The only surgery Talley said she ever had was to get her tonsils removed, according to Reuters. Talley credits her long life to her faith. She lives with her daughter, Thelma Holloway."
"It made the allegations in a damning report compiled after interviews with more than 200 Rohingya refugees who fled from Myanmar to Bangladesh.
One mother recounted how her five-year-old daughter was murdered while trying to protect her from rape.
She said a man ""took out a long knife and killed her by slitting her throat"".
In another case, an eight-month-old baby was reportedly killed while five security officers gang-raped his mother.
An estimated 65,000 members of the Muslim minority community have fled to Bangladesh since violence broke out in Myanmar - also known as Burma - last October.
Nearly half of those interviewed by the UN said a family member had been killed. Of 101 women interviewed, 52 said they had been raped or experienced sexual violence from the security forces.
Many told investigators that members of the army or police had burned hundreds of Rohingya homes, schools, markets, shops, and mosques.
Numerous testimonies ""confirmed that the army deliberately set fire to houses with families inside, and in other cases pushed Rohingyas into already burning houses"", the report states.
Many victims said they were taunted as they were being beaten or raped, with the perpetrators telling them: ""What can your Allah do for you? See what we can do?""
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein said: ""The cruelty to which these Rohingya children have been subjected is unbearable - what kind of hatred could make a man stab a baby crying out for his mother's milk?
""I call on the international community, with all its strength, to join me in urging the leadership in Myanmar to bring such military operations to an end.""
The country's government and its de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi have previously dismissed claims of rights abuses and insisted that the security forces follow the rule of law.
However, Ms Suu Kyi's spokesman told the BBC that the latest allegations were extremely serious. The spokesman said officials would look into them immediately."
"An internal inquiry by the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office in 2009 concluded that Reserve Deputy Robert Bates was shown special treatment and that training policies were violated regarding his role with the agency. Bates is the volunteer deputy who fatally shot suspect Eric Harris instead of stunning him with a Taser on April 2. A Harris family lawyer provided documents to CNN from the 2009 inquiry, which also found that supervisors intimidated employees to disregard policies to the benefit of Bates. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office has not responded to repeated calls for comment from CNN. An attorney for Bates, Clark O. Brewster, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Friday that he disputed the findings in the report and maintained that his client had the proper training. Bates, 73, is charged with second-degree manslaughter in the shooting of Harris. He pleaded not guilty. Bates was working as a reserve deputy for the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office on April 2 when he was involved the arrest of Harris in a weapons sting operation. Bates has said he meant to stun Harris with a Taser after the suspect fled from officers but mistakenly shot Harris with a gun instead. Bates has said the shooting was accidental. He has apologized to the Harris family, as has Sheriff Stanley Glanz. How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? The attorney for the Harris family said that Bates wasn't qualified to be on the force, but received preferential treatment because he'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff. The Tulsa World newspaper reported some supervisors in the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office were told to forge Bates' records and were reassigned when they refused. The sheriff's office denied the allegations in the newspaper's report. It also declined a CNN interview to respond to the claims. Over the weekend, one of Bates' attorneys released most of his training documents and said they prove Bates had proper law enforcement training. However, the records were incomplete. Bates' attorney, Brewster, characterized the 2009 memo as something borne out of jealousy by other officers. The allegations made in the report are the result of misunderstandings and misstatements, he said. The memos obtained by CNN show that a ""special investigation"" was launched in July 2009 at the request of then-Undersheriff Brian Edwards. Edwards asked investigators to look at two questions specifically: Was Bates being treated differently than any other reserve deputies, and were any employees pressured by supervisors to aid Bates? The investigation found that some employees felt pressured to sign off on certificates for training that Bates had not completed. Police caught on camera: The good and the bad . On Friday, the Tulsa County district attorney's office said it had received new information -- likely the 2009 memo -- that ""are worthy of further investigation beyond the scope of the manslaughter case."" The DA's office is reaching out to independent law enforcement agencies to investigate further. Contrary to claims by the sheriff's office that Bates had the required training to be in the field, the 2009 memo indicates otherwise. The document names then-Chief Deputy Tim Albin (currently undersheriff) and then-Capt. Tom Huckeby (now a major) as two supervisors who allegedly pressured lower-ranking officers to make exceptions or falsify records for Bates. One deputy reported that he was tasked with providing field training for Bates. The written policy is that a reserve deputy is required to have 480 hours of training, but that Huckeby and Albin pressured the trainer to write that Bates was qualified after only 320 hours. The trainer, fearing reassignment if he did not comply, signed a memo stating that Bates had completed 328 hours of training, and did not elaborate on details of the training. Later, the memo was amended by his superiors to read, in part, that Bates was ""capable of performing the functions of a patrol deputy."" The training deputy said he initialed the changes, even though he didn't think Bates was properly trained. According to the investigation memo, the trainer said that if he was honest, he would have said Bates needed remedial training, and that the reserve deputy was ""not really good at traffic stops or operations."" The internal investigation only turned up 72 hours of documented training. The trainer maintained that he oversaw 328 hours of training, but that the records were sent not to the records office, but instead to Huckeby. Brewster denied the claims made by the trainer, and alleged that trainer lost his job in part because of his conduct during the internal inquiry. Another deputy said that she signed a driving certificate for Bates, even though she believed he had not completed the training. Albin asked the deputy to make the certificate, and she did so without questioning him, according to the investigation. The memo lists other instances where Bates performed operations that he wasn't supposed to, given his stature in the department, but that complaints by other officers were dismissed by supervisors. Those who complained about Bates, according to the memo, were told to leave him alone or to make an exception, citing that he did a lot of good for the county and was close with the top leaders in the agency."
"What's worse than finding a cockroach in your Big Mac? Half a cockroach. After a stressful day of moving house, Annah Sophia Stevenson decided to get takeaway from Blenheim McDonald's for herself and her three-year-old son Luca at about 5.20pm on Saturday. The cosmetic artist, from New Zealand, found that after taking three bites of her burger something was not right and then pulled a half eaten, disemboweled cockroach out of her mouth. Scroll down for video . A New Zealand woman discovered a  cockroach after taking three bites into her Big Mac burger . 'I was working on it for about three or four seconds, I thought it was a bit of gristly meat,' Ms Stevenson told the Marlborough Express. 'The guts were hanging out and it had a big hole in the middle of it.' Ms Stevenson said she was trying to work her teeth through what must of been the insect's shell. After rushing to the bathroom to vomit, Ms Stevenson brushed her teeth only to find a piece of black shell lodged between her teeth. Ms Stevenson said she was trying to work her teeth through what must of been the insect's shell . The mother of one took to her Facebook account to post the alarming discovery after her McDonald's meal . 'I just couldn't cope, it felt like every time I swallowed I was swallowing bits of it,' she said. 'The incident was like something out of Fear Factor.' Shortly after the alarming discovery, the mother of one took to her Facebook account on Saturday night to post her horrible experience. 'Thanks McDonalds Blenheim, for the cockroach Big Mac. Only thing worse than finding it, was only finding half of it (have I consumed the other part?) and it was while I was chewing on it thinking it was a bit tough so pulled it out!!!,' she wrote. 'I feel violated, ill, traumatised, and disgusted.' The post has attracted more than 300 shares and several comments from family and friends. She usually avoids fast foods as she tries to keep healthy but due to her rushed time she ordered the meal . McDonald's have organised to pick up the evidence from Ms Stevenson in order to aid their investigation . The 26-year-old has yet to contact Blenheim McDonald's as she does not want to be bombarded with complimentary food vouchers. 'I'll never, ever eat another Big Mac as long as I live,' she said. According to Fairfax, McDonald's head of communications Simon Kenny said the incident would be investigated and McDonald's will pick up what remains of the evidence from Ms Stevenson. The mother said her family usually avoids fast foods in an attempt to keep healthy but ordered the meal due to time pressure. Along with her burger, she also ordered a McNugget Happy Meal and cheeseburger for her son and an icecream sundae and apple pie."
"The superstitious will know – or perhaps those who have seen Alfred Hitchcock's classic film The Birds – that a bird in the house is a bad omen and one that is said to equate to death. So a family in Texas would  be forgiven for being slightly put out about the fact that their home became infested with them. According to the video maker, who returns home with the other people in the clip to find the infestation, the birds came in through the chimney. The video maker stated that he initially thought the intruders were bats but now believes them to be sparrows . Capturing them on camera as they fly around the room, the man remains very calm while narrating on the carnage before him – birds crashing into the walls and flying overhead. He says: ‘There are birds everywhere, what the hell, look at this,’ before reiterating his point and recoiling as one crashes into him. A female voice then speaks out – also extremely calmly considering the fact the front room has been turned into an aviary. Despite the infestation of birds in their front room, the family remain very calm throughout the video . According to the video maker the birds managed to invade the house through the chimney . The lady says: ‘Careful not to step on them,’ as the video maker points out that some of the birds appear to be dying, as they lie on the ground. The filmmaker then states: ‘This is awful,’ and suggests that the group need to find a way to get the birds out of the house. The video concludes with the filmmaker continuing to record the birds as they circle the room and bounce off the walls. The video maker states that the scene is awful as a number of birds crash into the walls and end up on the floor . According to the video maker there were around 30 birds in the front room when the group came home. Speaking on another video, he also states that he initially thought they were bats before realising they were birds and potentially sparrows."
"A 30-year-old Scouser released by Shrewsbury and Tranmere in recent years was the hero of Scottish football at the weekend. Full back David Raven stabbed home the winner to take Inverness Caledonian Thistle to the Scottish Cup final. You can only be pleased for him – he must have thought his career glory had been and gone when he made a few appearances in the Liverpool first team as a youngster (he played in the infamous 1-0 defeat for Rafa Benitez's Reds at Burnley in 2005 – Djimi Traore's silky back-heeled own goal deciding the game). It's a fantastic moment for Raven, good luck to him in the final. But what can we deduce about the state of Scottish football from the two Hampden Park semi-finals last weekend? David Raven peels away after scoring the winner for Inverness against Celtic in the Scottish Cup semi-final . Raven celebrates with team-mate Ryan Christie as Inverness knocked Celtic out at Hampden . Well with Scotland's top club, Celtic, taking the decision to embarrass themselves publicly by writing to the SFA crying about a penalty they weren't awarded against Inverness, you can see there are problems. I interviewed goal hero Raven and he seemed upset by Celtic's actions: 'For a club that size to write to the SFA is a bit much, it's definitely taken the gloss off it a little bit for me. I'm surprised a club like Celtic have done that – it's a bit of an error of judgment for me. I don't know what they're hoping to get out of it,' he told me. Well done Celtic, your extreme arrogance managed to spoil the highlight of an honest pro's career. You should be ashamed of themselves. Celtic think they are so gigantic they have a divine right to get to the final. Apparently only they can make themselves the victims of bad decisions from officials. Celtic are like the brat of a child, over-indulged by parents, and scoffing too many sweets and not sharing any with the other kids because of some superiority complex which isn't backed up by what's actually going on. And the mismanagement of the Scottish game has left it imbalanced and unattractive. Whichever way you look at it, Scottish football, like an unsafe, stinking high rise on the wrong side of Glasgow, needs wiping out and starting again. Firstly, Celtic need bringing down a peg or two. There is nothing to suggest they are bigger than the game of football, yet they act like they are lords and masters of all around them. Celtic didn't get a penalty – so what? Inverness should have had one when sub keeper Lukasz Zaluska bulldozed into the back of an opponent. As bad losers go, Celtic are just about the worst of the lot. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths complained: 'We were robbed.' The whole of football is laughing in his face! Imagine how Rangers fans felt when the authorities banished their club to the brink of non-league football. Now that's being robbed. None of this reflects well on Scottish football. Josh Meekings (centre) appeared to handle the ball in the box but no penalty was awarded to Celtic . Kris Commons appeals for a penalty after Meeking's apparent hand ball but it was to no avail . Celtic captain Scott Brown appeals to referee Steve McLean - the club have since written to the SFA . Next the game north of the border must do more to attract supporters to matches. For Saturday's game between Hibs and Falkirk there were 30,000 empty seats, while nearly 25,000 were missing for Sunday's tie. Two showpiece games at the country's national stadium should be getting close to sell-out crowds. The two biggest clubs in the country – Celtic and Rangers - regularly have loads of empty seats at home games. Where is the passion for football in Scotland? Has it disappeared completely? Was it the curling craze that did it? Have Rhona Martin and all curlers since the Olympic gold medallist hit her peak become the new heroes rather than iron bruisers like Scott Brown? What about on the pitch: take a look at the three Inverness scorers on Sunday: Raven I've told you about; Greg Tansey I first saw when he was a teenager at Stockport and I was impressed. His career since then has levelled out. He's a good technician, but having been allowed to leave Stevenage last year when they were bottom of League One you'd have to question his all-round ability. And Edward Ofere scored a cracker at Hampden, finding the net for the second successive weekend. But this is a 29-year-old Nigerian striker who has yet to play a competitive international game and has had a Nomadic footballing existence thumbing his way around the minor European leagues so far. It's a great moment for these players and for Inverness, but let's not confuse that with anything remotely resembling high quality football. These are journeymen who have worked hard to earn their big day out. James Dunne was a cup winner in Scotland with St Johnstone last season, this year he's been picking up yellow cards in the bottom half of League Two with Portsmouth. Large swathes of Hampden were empty for both Scottish Cup semi-finals over the weekend . The standard of Scottish football has continued to fall and the game needs to be overhauled . Inverness manager John Hughes, sacked by Hartlepool after relegation to League Two less than two years ago, has moulded these players into a side that sits third in the Scottish Premiership table, and favourites to win the Scottish Cup final. In some ways you have to be impressed, and the Caley fans are loving it right now of course. But the standard is not high, and that's not healthy for Scottish football. With the quality on the pitch lacking, it's no surprise the fans can't be bothered to pay and watch. You sign English League Two players and you'll get League Two crowds. What's needed is a total restructuring: a bigger top division in Scotland for a start. That would ensure the biggest clubs have the best chance of staying there, and it would mean the clubs play each other only twice a season in the league – familiarity has bred boredom with a smaller Scottish Premiership. Beyond the top flight, establish only one division with strict criteria for stadia and salary capping. That way clubs are less likely to suffer financial crisis, but standards are maintained, and the focus is on quality in those top two divisions, rather than the current situation where resources spread far too thinly over four leagues. Somehow a fairer distribution of wealth is needed in Scotland. Pumping all the money into Celtic hasn't led to any success in Europe – in fact Celtic have got worse. So spread the money more evenly, generate competition, and maybe that way Scotland can become strong again. It's not all bad - Falkirk's matchwinner on Saturday Craig Sibbald looks like a decent footballer, yet he can't get in the Scotland Under 21 squad. There are some promising young Scottish players around right now, no doubt about that. But overall Scottish football is in a bad way right now. It's in need of major surgery. Celtic's pathetic letter should fire the SFA into action. Celtic's Emilio Izaguirre cuts a dejected figure at full-time after his side failed to reach the final ."
"David Haye was arrested at Dubai airport and held in a police cell over a £341,000 bounced cheque, it has been reported. Former two-weight world champion Haye, 34, was stopped by officials on his arrival at Dubai International Airport and accused of fraud by writing a cheque as payment for a new property which bounced. The boxer, who has not fought since he defeated Dereck Chisora in July 2012, also handed over his passport to authorities, and has been unable to leave the United Arab Emirates - forcing him to miss a mixed martial arts event in Birmingham at the weekend. Former heavyweight boxing champion David Haye was stopped at Dubai International Airport and questioned over allegations that he wrote a £341,000 cheque which bounced. He is pictured during his trip to Dubai . The cheque, worth 1.8million Emirati Dirham, was intended as a final payment on a newly-built property, as part of a deal with developers Emaar, which is part-owned by the Dubai government. Haye has said the 'bounced' cheque  was down to an administrative error. He told The Sun's Michael Hamilton: 'The cheque was presented to the bank four days before I landed. It was not due to be presented until final completion of my property, which is due in a few weeks. 'This was an administrative error which is being rectified. I explained to the police and presented documents as proof. But I can totally understand these mistakes can happen.' Writing a cheque that later bounces is a crime in Dubai, and can be punishable with jail, a fine, and being ordered to pay the amount. Haye had been due to attend a mixed martial arts event in Birmingham on Saturday but was unable to leave the UAE. Instead he went to a Robbie Williams concert in Abu Dhabi . Police give suspects one month to pay the value of the cheque before taking the case to court. Figures released last June showed that Dubai police dealt with almost 80,000 bounced cheques in 2013-14, worth 9.4billion Dirham, or £1.7bn. According to The Sun, Haye was held at the airport as he arrived for a holiday earlier this month after he was flagged up on a wanted list. He was reportedly taken to Bur Dubai police station, which has a department for bounced cheque suspects, and was released the same day. He surrendered his passport, as did two of his associates. The Foreign Office is understood to have had no involvement in the case. Haye has not been seen in the boxing ring since he defeated Dereck Chisora in July 2012. He is pictured after the fight at Upton Park with the WBA and WBO International Heavyweight Championship belts . During his stay in Dubai, Haye has reportedly been staying at the luxurious Palm Jumeirah development, and has been tweeting photographs of himself enjoying the sunshine, as well as meeting fans. He posted a video to his Instagram account today thanking fans for their concern over an 'administrative issue' as he walked along a beach in the sunshine. In the video, which he captioned 'Don't worry about me too much!!!', he said: 'Thanks for all your worry and concern but don't get too stressed about me, things aren't that bad. 'A little administrative issue has left me in Dubai for a few days longer than anticipated but it's getting smoothed out as we speak and I'll be back - probably in London or Las Vegas soon.' Haye had been due to attend a BAMMA mixed martial arts event in Birmingham on Saturday, where he was to present a live broadcast for channel Spike TV, but was forced to cancel due to his extended stay in Dubai. Instead, his place on the commentary team was taken by WBA super-middleweight champion Carl Froch. In an Instagram message which was also posted to the event's Facebook page, Haye said: 'Sorry I can't be there tonight for BAMMA 20, I'm gutted, I'm stuck here in Dubai but I'll be there on June 13 in Birmingham for BAMMA 21.' 'Enjoy the action tonight, it's going to be great.' While he should have been in Birmingham, Haye instead told his 1.05 million Twitter followers that he had been to a Robbie Williams concert in Abu Dhabi, writing: 'Rluctantly came to @robbiewilliams concert Abu Dhabi, as not my style of music. But I'm a fan now, pure old school!' [sic]. Haye has not been seen in the  ring since he defeated Dereck Chisora in July 2012, while two planned fights against British rival Tyson Fury have fallen through, the second as a result of shoulder surgery. Despite being advised by doctors to give up boxing, he is said to be planning a comeback and hopes to fight again within the next 18 months. Since his last fight he has also appeared in the 12th series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here, finishing third in the television contest in November 2012. MailOnline has contacted Emaar for comment."
"A northern Indiana pizzeria that closed after its owner said his religious beliefs wouldn't allow him to cater a gay wedding opened Thursday to a full house of friends, regulars and people wanting to show their support. 'It's a relief to get going again and try to get back to normal,' said Kevin O'Connor, owner of Memories Pizza. O'Connor closed the shop for eight days after comments by him and his daughter, Crystal, to a local television station supporting a new religious objections law. The law, which has since been revised, sparked a boycott of Indiana. Scroll down for video . Full house: Many customers wait for service as Memories Pizza reopened for business on Thursday. A crowdfunding campaign started by supporters raised more than $842,000 with donations from 29,160 contributors in 48 hours . Owner Kevin O'Connor closed the shop (seen on Tuesday)  for eight days after comments by him and his daughter, Crystal, to a local television station supporting a new religious objections law . O'Connor, the  61-year-old father of eight who has owned the restaurant for nine years said he never thought about taking the money and retiring. Crystal O'Connor said the amount of money was overwhelming . O'Connor said the criticism hasn't changed his beliefs. He said gays are welcome in his restaurant in the small, one-traffic-light town of Walkerton, 20 miles southwest of South Bend, but that he would decline to cater a same-sex wedding because it would conflict with his Christian beliefs. 'I'd do the same thing again. It's my belief. It's our belief. It's what we grew up on,' he said. 'I'm just sorry it comes to this because neither one of us dislike any of those people. I don't hold any grudges.' A crowdfunding campaign started by supporters raised more than $842,000 with donations from 29,160 contributors in 48 hours. O'Connor said he hasn't received the money yet, but said he plans to give some to charity and use some money to make improvements to the restaurant. The 61-year-old father of eight who has owned the restaurant for nine years said he never thought about taking the money and retiring. 'I enjoy it. I don't want to leave here,' he said. 'I want this to be something that my daughter can enjoy.' Crystal O'Connor said the amount of money was overwhelming. Anger: A protester is seen outside Memories Pizza in this photo with a sign that reads 'Bigots' Uproar: Protesters (like the ones seen here on March 28) have been upset over Indiana passing a new law, which critics said allows businesses the ability to refuse service to gay customers on religious grounds. The law, which has since been revised, sparked a boycott of Indiana . Family: O'Connor, seen with his daughter Crystal, says gays are welcome in his restaurant, but he would decline to cater a same-sex wedding because it would conflict with his beliefs . The restaurant reopened about 4 p.m. Thursday. O'Connor says that within an hour, all eight tables were filled and six people were waiting for carryout orders . 'We were like, `Stop! Stop! Stop!'"" she said. 'It was really making us uncomfortable,' her father said. The restaurant reopened about 4 p.m. Thursday. He says that within an hour, all eight tables were filled and six people were waiting for carryout orders. There were no protests as of 7 p.m. Jeanne and Ken Gumm from outside LaPorte, about 20 miles northwest of Walkerton, said they had been waiting for the pizzeria to reopen so they could show their support. 'We couldn't wait to get down here,"" said Ken Gumm, 66, a tank truck driver. 'To us this whole thing isn't about gay marriage. It's mostly about freedom of religion.'"
"The former world champion will target the time trial and may also support Lizzie Armitstead in the road race.
Pooley, 33, retired from cycling after winning two silver medals at the 2014 Commonwealth Games to concentrate on triathlon and other endurance events.
""This is a truly rare opportunity that I can't resist,"" she said.
Pooley won silver in the time trial at the 2008 Beijing Olympics before finishing sixth in the event at London 2012, where she also helped Armitstead win a silver medal in the road race.
The 29.8km time trial course in Rio features the 1.2km, 7% average gradient Grumari climb and the ""impressively hilly nature"" of the terrain persuaded Pooley, renowned for her climbing abilities, to come out of retirement and target a gold medal.
""I've decided it's worth a serious attempt at targeting that event,"" she said in a statement on Wednesday.
""If I can prove to both myself and the GB team selectors that I have the capacity to win the time trial in Rio, I'll compete for selection for the Olympic team - I'm happy knowing I won't get selected unless I really do have the potential to win.
""I have no desire to go to the Rio Games, and sacrifice some of the most exciting triathlon races of the season, just for the experience of another Olympics - I'm committed to aiming for gold.""
After turning to multi-sport events in August 2014, Pooley won the world long-distance duathlon title at the first attempt a month later, breaking the course record by 16 minutes.
She successfully defended her crown in September and is aiming to make it three consecutive wins next year, adding that long-distance triathlon and duathlon remain her ""main focus"" in 2016.
Yet after studying the Rio courses, British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton says he approached Pooley about a return, believing she could also improve world champion Armistead's chances of winning gold in the road race.
""I'm really pleased that Emma saw the value in the opportunity and is back with us,"" he added.
""Having her talent and experience in the team enhances our medal prospects in the time trial and Lizzie Armitstead's opportunity to win the road race.
""The road race field is likely to fall away from behind, but as a pure mountain climber, I don't see Emma falling away. It would be great to see her in the road race supporting Lizzie.""
Meanwhile, former Tour de France champion Sir Bradley Wiggins says he wants to keep riding beyond this season, having previously claimed he would retire at the end of 2016.
The four-time Olympic gold medallist, 35, is set to compete in the team pursuit on the track at Rio and could continue racing into 2017.
""I will see how I feel this time next year,"" he said.
""There might be other opportunities. If I haven't got a job by this time next year I will keep racing."""
"Cristiano Ronaldo didn't have too much joy with his trademark free-kicks during Real Madrid's victory over neighbours Atletico this week - but it didn't stop him from showing his compassionate side. The Portuguese star has devoted hours on the training field to mastering the art of the perfect set-piece, but even the best in the business occasionally get it wrong. In the white-hot atmosphere of the Santiago Bernabeu prior to Wednesday night's second-leg Champions League quarter-final, when every minute of preparation is key, there was still time for Ronaldo to display a small but heartfelt act of kindness. Cristiano Ronaldo shows his delight after Real Madrid finally broke the deadlock against rivals Atletico . But it was a different story before the game as Ronaldo expressed his concern after his shot hit a supporter . After completing his warm-up routine Ronaldo went over to the touchline and lifted off his training shirt . After receiving the forward's shirt the young supporter was clearly overcome with emotion at the kind act . As the former Manchester United forward trained his sights with long-range attempts, one effort flew wide of the target and into the crowd, striking a young supporter in the front row. Ronaldo winced as he realised the extent of the damage his shot had caused but was ordered to continue preparing for the crucial tie with the rest of Carlo Ancelotti's group. Video courtesy of Sport1, The Netherlands . Once the final sprint drill had been completed, however, the 30-year-old made a dash for the supporter and removed his training shirt. In a classy gesture, Ronaldo offered the young boy the warm-up garment as a consolation for being on the receiving end of his venomous shot. Unsurprisingly, the young Madridista was star-struck by the warm deed, becoming teary-eyed at the unexpected turn of events. Madrid made hard work of a well-drilled Atletico side, but it was poster-boy Ronaldo's pass into Javier Hernandez that killed off the valiant attempts of Diego Simeone's 10 men in the 88th minute of the local affair - much to the delight of the stricken fan and the majority of those at the Bernabeu. Ronaldo's training shirt can be seen scrunched up in the hands of the star-struck supporter on the sideline ."
"Jenson Button was left to reflect on 'not a great day' and fears he will again be at the back of the grid for Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix. Just three minutes into the first practice session, Button's McLaren suffered an electrical fault that cut the engine and forced him into a spin at turn one of the Bahrain International Circuit. Although the car was recovered, his mechanics failed to fix the fault until just before the start of FP2, in which three laps in he had to stop out on track as a safety precaution for the engine. Jenson Button makes his way back to the pits after his McLaren broke down on Friday . Again the car returned to the garage, and although he made it out on track later in the session, further issues arose that compromised his running. The 35-year-old ultimately finished down in 19th place, sandwiched between Manor duo Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi, with the best of his 19 laps almost 4.5 seconds off the pace of Nico Rosberg in his Mercedes. Clearly frustrated Button said: 'The guys worked really hard, from P1 to P2 they did a great job but we still had our problems in P2. 'I went out on the soft tyre but had to quickly come back in, and then I went out on low fuel when everyone else was on high fuel, so it was difficult to get in any running. Overall not a great day. 'There was a lot of useful data from the other car (Fernando Alonso), but the frustrating thing is our cars were set up quite differently to get a lot of useful information about parts, and we weren't able to do that on our car. 'It doesn't help either of us for Saturday but hopefully we've resolved the issues I've had.' Team members recover Button's McLaren in the pit-lane during the first free practice . Button, though, knows the teams ahead of a struggling McLaren will all turn up the gas in qualifying, which is likely to leave only the Manor boys behind the Briton and Alonso, as was the case in China on Sunday. 'I think some teams were on high fuel all day as well, so it's not going to be an easy weekend,' added Button. 'But we're not kidding ourselves, we know it's going to be a tricky qualifying session and I suppose for us at the moment we're going to qualify near the back. 'In reality it's not such a problem. The race pace is something that is more important.'"
"The 2016 Rio Olympics GB Sevens silver medallist appeared to use a gesture and swear at referee Greg Garner.
Scarlets have condemned Davies' ""abusive language or actions"".
In a statement, the player said: ""I would like to apologise to my team-mates, the fans, the Scarlets, my family and the rugby community.""
In the 28th minute at Stade Felix Mayol, Garner called over Davies and Scarlets captain Ken Owens and told Davies: ""If you use that language again on the pitch, I'll send you off.""
Davies said he had apologised to English official Garner during and after the game.
He added: ""During the heat of battle I lost my composure and said and did things I deeply regret.
""I apologised to referee Mr Garner both during and after the game but would like to reiterate my sincerest apologies publically.""
A Scarlets spokesperson said: ""The Scarlets hold the unique values of rugby union in the highest regard.
""Our players are all aware of their responsibility as role models and custodians of those values.
""We unreservedly condemn any foul or abusive language or actions like those displayed by James Davies on Sunday.""
Davies could now face disciplinary action that could affect his chances of facing Toulon in their rematch at Parc y Scarlets, Llanelli on Sunday.
Scarlets say they will comply fully with ""disciplinary procedures"" and conduct an internal investigation into the incident."

The American, 32, looked set to take part after warming up on the range but he then withdrew on the first tee.
The US Open champion fell on the stairs and hurt his lower back on Wednesday.
""I'm playing the best golf of my life and to have a freak accident happen yesterday afternoon, it sucks really bad,"" said Johnson.
""I have been worked on all morning and obviously I can take some swings, but I can't swing full, I can't make my normal swing and I didn't think there was any chance I could compete.""
The 15-time PGA Tour winner added: ""I was wearing socks and slipped and went down the three stairs. The left side of my lower back took the brunt of it and my left elbow is bruised as well.""
Johnson's caddie was placing the ball on his tee for him on the range, while coach Butch Harmon said pain hindered Johnson's rest overnight.
Shortly before his withdrawal, he progressed from hitting wedge shots on the range to fuller swings and his involvement looked likely as he made his way to the first tee for a scheduled 19:03 BST start alongside playing partners Bubba Watson and Jimmy Walker.
Johnson was a popular pick to win the first major of the year as a result of the fine form he has shown in 2017. He has won the past three tournaments in which he has competed - February's Genesis Open, and both the WGC Mexico Championship and WGC Dell Match Play in March.
As well as winning last year's US Open by four shots, he finished ninth at the Open Championship and tied fourth at the Masters.
BBC Radio 5 live correspondent Iain Carter
Johnson took until the very last second to make what must have been an agonising decision to pull out. He was standing on the first tee before making the toughest call of his career. It is a severe blow for the player who has dominated golf this season.
He arrived here off the back of three big victories and was a justifiable favourite. All that has been lost through his freak fall at his rental home and the damage done to his back."
"At the meeting in Paris between Pep Guardiola and Roman Abramovich in the summer of 2012, the former Barcelona coach made it clear that he craved stability. Abramovich’s track record with managers had not been good, dispensing with Claudio Ranieri, Jose Mourinho, Avram Grant, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Carlo Ancelotti and Andre Villas-Boas when he raged against results. Sensibly, Guardiola approached with caution. At Barcelona, his relationship with successive presidents, Joan Laporta and Sandro Rossell, had fluctuated wildly during Guardiola’s hugely successful spell as head coach. Pep Guardiola, the Bayern Munich coach, craves stability and chooses his clubs based on such assurances . Bayern's dominance of the German domestic scene means Guardiola may be tempted by a move this summer . Manuel Pellegrini's position at Manchester City is under threat as they fight for fourth place . Abramovich had been seduced by Barcelona’s football, the 14 titles that the club won during Guardiola’s four years in charge before he took off to New York with his family for a year-long sabbatical. Chelsea’s inner circle believed they had finally landed their man and Abramovich began recruiting players in anticipation of his arrival. Eden Hazard arrived from Lille for £32m and Oscar from Internacional for £25m. Marko Marin, a £7m capture from Werder Bremen, was another gamble. Then Abramovich blew the deal by firing his European Cup-winning coach the morning after a catastrophic 3-0 defeat in Turin against Antonio Conte’s Juventus. It turned out to be a painful lesson. Guardiola was spooked, pulling out of the deal to become Chelsea’s next manager the following day and decided instead to succeed Jupp Heynckes at Bayern Munich. Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich believed he had landed Guardiola in the summer of 2012 - but the then-Barcelona coach was spooked by the Russian's habit of hiring and firing managers . Expecting Guardiola to arrive, Abramovich recruited the likes of Eden Hazard (right) for £32m . Guardiola opted to join Bayern Munich instead and has maintained their dominance in the Bundesliga . BARCELONA . La Liga 2008-09, 2009-10, 2010-11 . Copa del Rey 2008-09, 2011-12 . Supercopa de Espana 2009, 2010, 2011 . UEFA Champions League 2008-09, 2010-11 . UEFA Super Cup 2009, 2011 . FIFA Club World Cup 2009, 2011 . BAYERN MUNICH . Bundesliga 2013-14 . German Cup 2013-14 . UEFA Super Cup 2013 . FIFA Club World Cup 2013 . This is precisely the scenario that is facing Manchester City as they weigh up what on earth they are going to do with a coach who can no longer motivate his players. It is an open secret that City want Guardiola to become their next manager, but the indications are that he will not be ready to leave Bayern Munich until 2016, when his three-year contract expires, at the very earliest. To wait 12 months or more for a manager who will have the top clubs in the Barclays Premier League falling at his feet when he announces that he will leave the Allianz Arena is a dangerous position to be in. Timing, as ever, is everything. According to the inside story on Guardiola’s first season at Bayern, there is an anecdote in the book Pep Confidential that indicates that he could see himself one day managing Manchester United. In the same book Guardiola also discloses that Txiki Begiristain, the former Barcelona winger who now works at City as the sporting director, also approached him in the summer of 2012. To appeal to Guardiola, he demands stability because he knows the training facilities, the stadium, the support and the financial power, through television rights, commercial arrangements and ticketing, is already in place. To fire Pellegrini with six games left of the Barclays Premier League season would be an admission by City’s owners that anything other than the Premier League trophy or the Champions League warrants a dismissal. City's place in the Premier League top four is under threat from Liverpool and Southampton . City slipped to a 4-2 loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday, leaving them in fourth place . Pellegrini guided City to the Premier League trophy last season but they've fallen well short this time . That was Chelsea’s game before Mourinho returned, via spells at Inter Milan and Real Madrid, and they lost a lot of goodwill over it. City felt a mild tremor too when word got out that they were about to fire Roberto Mancini, the manager who led them to their first Premier League title, on the eve of the 2013 FA Cup final against Wigan. After that, City vowed to be different. After meekly surrendering their Premier League title and being given another chasing by Barcelona over two legs in the Champions League, it is clear that City have failed to make significant progress under Pellegrini. The concern now, especially after Liverpool’s 2-0 victory over Newcastle on Monday evening, is that the club could yet fall out of the top four. Even though City appear to have a favourable run-in against West Ham, Aston Villa, Tottenham, QPR and Swansea before the final game of the season against Southampton, there is a contingency plan open to them. Guardiola holds the European Cup after Barcelona's 3-1 win over Manchester United in the 2011 final . Guardiola is thrown in the air by his Barcelona players after their 2009 Champions League win . Patrick Vieira, currently in charge of City's Elite Development Squad, could take charge until May . Patrick Vieira, currently in charge of City’s Elite Development Squad, has the respect of the first-team players and could yet be parachuted in to see the season through. Fourth place is critical. The difficulty beyond that scenario is what to do beyond the end of the season because a club with City’s ambitions cannot limp on for another 12 months in the hope that Guardiola becomes available. He demands consistency, a stable environment to allow him to work with his players on the training ground, preparing for a match every three days. That is the cycle for Guardiola at Bayern, picking the bones out of their 3-0 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt at the weekend before moving on to the Champions League quarter-final against Porto in Estadio do Dragao. He is always looking ahead, much like the chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov after they became friends during Guardiola’s year in New York. For Manchester City, it is down to them to make the next move."
"Kevin Standing's vehicle was taken from his home in Patcham, East Sussex, on Saturday morning. It did not have a tracker and there was no CCTV evidence.
He said he had wrongly assumed an officer would visit him, but he was told there were no lines of inquiry.
Sussex Police said they focused on crimes that ""cause most harm"".
Mr Standing said he received a letter from the force on Tuesday saying the ""investigation was closed"" and to check the CCTV footage of local garages.
""It basically says to car thieves in Sussex, 'carry on stealing cars because there's very little chance you're going to get caught',"" he said.
Ch Insp Bruce Mathews said proportionate inquiries had been completed.
""Our investigations teams focuses its efforts on the crimes which cause the most harm.
""Operating with new demands against a shrinking budget, we can't do everything but that doesn't mean we will be ruling out certain types of crime such as shoplifting or vehicle crime.
""We will continue to do so where there are lines of inquiry.""
The force said a marker had been placed on the vehicle to bring it to the attention of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras."
"Her job brought her into close contact with Goebbels - one of the worst war criminals of the 20th century.
She was one of the last surviving members of staff from the Nazi hierarchy, who only spoke about her experience later in life.
In a recent documentary, she said she had known nothing of the murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust.
In ""A German Life"", which was released last year, she said she felt no guilt - ""unless you end up blaming the entire German population"".
Born in January 1911, Ms Pomsel worked as a writer for a Jewish insurance broker for a number of years during her late teenage years, before taking a similar job with a right-wing writer.
Although she claimed that she had always been apolitical, she joined the Nazi party when they took power in 1933, in order to take a government job with German national radio.
Her skill as a typist, she said, brought her to the role of Joseph Goebbels' secretary in 1942, during the war, when he was minister of ""public enlightenment and propaganda"".
She described Goebbels as ""a good looking man ... a bit short"", who was always well-groomed and well-dressed - but arrogant.
She said she was simply a secretary and knew little of the Nazi's brutal actions during the Holocaust.
""The people who today say they would have done more for those poor, persecuted Jewsâ€¦ I really believe that they sincerely mean it,"" she said in interviews for A German Life. ""But they wouldn't have done it either.""
But she always maintained that she did not share in the blame for the actions of her superiors.
""I wouldn't see myself as being guilty,"" she said. ""Unless you end up blaming the entire German population for ultimately enabling that government to take control. That was all of us. Including me.""
Her Jewish friend, Eva Lowenthal, disappeared in November 1943. Sixty years later, Ms Pomsel discovered she had died in the Auschwitz concentration camp.
Ms Pomsel was captured by Soviet troops at the end of World War Two - and spent the following five years in detention camps, before rejoining German broadcasting in 1950, where she worked for the next 20 years.
She would not speak openly about her time serving the senior Nazi official until a 2011 newspaper interview, and more extensively in the 2016 documentary.
She passed away in Munich a few weeks after her 106th birthday."
"He played in 64 Tests as a leg-spinning all-rounder and captained Australia to world dominance in the 1950s but to millions of fans Richie Benaud, who died last night aged 84, was the voice of cricket. The great commentator, who had been receiving treatment for skin cancer since November, began broadcasting for the BBC while still a player in 1963 and carried on until a car crash forced him out of the commentary box in 2013. It was hoped he would still be able to commentate on the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand earlier this year but ill-health sadly ended hopes of one last masterclass. Richie Benaud was one of cricket's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge . Benaud was the voice of cricket for generations, commentating in his native Australia and for the BBC . Benaud, pictured on his wedding day to wife Daphne, and during his time as Australia captain . Benaud, quite simply, was the voice of summer, both in his native land and in England, as much for what he did not say as what he did. Always understated, Benaud knew when to let the pictures do the talking before entering our living rooms with just the right words. He took 248 Test wickets and hit 2,201 runs, with three centuries, and reclaimed the Ashes for Australia as captain before successfully defending them twice. His commentary rules should be required reading for anyone entering the commentary box today. They included these: never ask a statement; there are no teams in the world called we or they; avoid cliches and banalities; remember that the Titanic was a tragedy and the Ethiopian drought a disaster and neither bears any relation to a dropped catch and, most importantly, don’t take yourself too seriously and have some fun. WATCH SHANE WARNE'S BALL OF THE CENTURY WITH RICHIE BENAUD'S CLASSIC UNDERSTATED COMMENTARY . BENAUD SLAMS AUSTRALIANS FOR BOWLING UNDERARM TO PREVENT NEW ZEALAND FROM SCORING FROM FINAL BALL OF 1981 MATCH . Benaud was a daring captain and became the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in Tests . David Gower, Geoffrey Boycott and Benaud assembled a formidable line-up for the BBC in 1995 . A master with the microphone to his lips, Benaud also was well aware of the power of silence . January 1952: Test debut against West Indies at Sydney Cricket Ground . January 1952: First of 248 Test wickets and 2,201 Test runs . December 1958: First Test as Australia captain, v England at Brisbane . Summer 1960: First radio commentary for BBC . December 1963: In his 60th Test, the first to 2,000 Test runs & 200 wickets . Summer 1963: First television commentary for BBC . February 1964: Final Test against South Africa at Sydney Cricket Ground . September 2005: Final commentary in England after 42 years . In becoming one of the leading figures of Kerry Packer’s World Series revolution in the 1970s Benaud gave the fledgling breakaway group the voice of authority they required. Yet any suggestion of his being anti-establishment has long since been forgotten and the leading figures in Australian cricket and life queued up to pay tribute to arguably the most famous Aussie of them all last night. ‘There would hardly be an Australian over the last 40 years who hasn’t listened to Richie Benaud,’ said Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, and that could also apply to English men and women. ‘He certainly will be very, very much missed.’ Today Abbott offered Benaud's family a state funeral for him, if they wish it. Cricket Australia chairman Wally Edwards said: ‘Our country has lost a national treasure. After Don Bradman, there has been no Australian player more famous or more influential than Richie Benaud.’ Benaud never lost the ability to say absolutely the right thing and that was never more in evidence than in what will go down as his last significant public words. An evocative 30 second tribute to the late Phillip Hughes was prepared for Channel Nine by Benaud when, as ever, he captured the mood perfectly. Benaud (front left) leads Australia off at Old Trafford in 1961 as England collapsed against his side's spin . Benaud, pictured in 2006 during the launch of his book My Take on Cricket, was widely respected and loved . Benaud pays tribute to Australian media mogul and cricket pioneer Kerry Packer after his death in 2005 . 'A boy just beginning, 25 years of age, baggy green number 408,' read Benaud in what were still his unmistakable tones when the cricket world had to endure what really was a tragedy with the death of a young player at the SCG. 'His father's best mate, son, brother, fighter, friend, inspiration. Phillip Hughes, forever rest in peace son.' The whole cricketing world will be echoing those sentiments for the greatest commentator of them all. Richie Benaud, who was made an OBE in 1961 for services to cricket, left a wife of 48 years in Daphne and two children from his first marriage. He will forever set the standards for others to follow. Tributes are seen at the statue of Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground after his passing aged 84 . ON COMMENTATING . 'What I want most from being a television commentator is to be able to feel that, when I say something, I am talking to friends.' 'My mantra is: put your brain into gear and if you can add to what's on the screen then do it, otherwise shut up.' 'The key thing was to learn the value of economy with words and to never insult the viewer by telling them what they can already see.' 'Out in the field, you haven't got anyone whispering into your ear saying all sorts of things, you've got to do it yourself.' ON CAPTAINCY . 'The hallmark of a great captain is the ability to win the toss, at the right time.' 'Captaincy is 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent skill. But don't try it without that 10 per cent.' ON BATTING . 'Bruce Reid is not the worst batsman there is at international level but those who are worse would not need to hire the Myer Music Bowl to hold a convention.' 'Glenn McGrath dismissed for two, just ninety-eight runs short of his century.' 'He's not quite got hold of that one. If he had, it would have gone for nine.' ON BOWLING . 'A bleeding ring finger at the end of every training session was not only normal but essential for my development as a wrist spinner.' 'Your wrist must be cocked, but not stiffly cocked.' 'You must always look where you want to land it. If I offered you 10,000 dollars to hit a tin can, you'd never take your eyes off it.' ON TWENTY20 CRICKET . 'If any form of game can pull 20,000 spectators into a game of cricket it's great for the sport. I think it's wonderful.' 'As long as the people who run the game have brains and keep three forms of the game I think it will be terrific.' ON SHANE WARNE'S 'BALL OF THE CENTURY . 'Gatting has absolutely no idea what has happened to it. Still doesn't know.' ON 1981's 'UNDERARM BOWLING' SCANDAL . 'A disgraceful performance from a captain who got his sums wrong. It should never be permitted to happen again. One of the worst things I have ever seen done on a cricket field.' MISCELLANEOUS . 'The slow-motion replay doesn't show how fast the ball was really travelling.' 'A cricket ground is a flat piece of earth with some buildings around it.' 'He's usually a good puller - but he couldn't get it up that time.' 'Cricket has changed for the better ... it's because of what happened then, cricket is so strong now.'"
"You’ve found the house of your dreams – but you want to make sure the costly nightmare of dry rot isn’t lurking under the carpets and skirting boards. The solution? Call in the dogs! The appropriately named Mark Doggett has trained his two animals to sniff out the destructive fungus in old houses where it can hide in places a person would miss. Mr Doggett gave up a ten-year career in construction after hitting on the idea to set up a business using the animals’ sense of smell, which is said to be up to a million times better than that of humans. Skilled: Meg and Jess, pictured with Mark Doggett, were trained for six months to sniff out dry rot . On the case: Four-year-old Border collie Meg gets down to work sniffing out the destructive fungus . When they find dry rot they stop, stare at it and point with their nose, only moving from the affected area when Mr Doggett gives them a special signal . After six months of training, four-year-old border collie Meg and 22-month-old English springer spaniel Jess went to work. When they find dry rot they stop, stare at it and point with their nose, only moving from the affected area when Mr Doggett gives them a special signal. The businessman, 30, from Wolverhampton, whose company is called Enviro-Dogs, said: ‘We’re unique in offering a dry rot detection service using dogs to the public. The dogs can go out to domestic properties or surveyors can hire us as part of their report. Dry rot is wood decay caused by the fungus Serpula lacrymans that digests the parts of the wood which give it strength. By the time there are visible signs, serious damage will have been done. It begins as a microscopic spore but the final stage is a fruiting body which pumps out new spores. Once airborne they can damage all parts of a property, penetrating brickwork and concrete floors seeking a wood source. If not treated, it can destroy a building. “It’s not really work for the dogs – they see it as the best game in the world and they enjoy it because it’s working on their natural instincts. The dogs are so effective because they can detect dry rot at much earlier stages. ‘In hidden places dry rot can grow for years without anyone noticing it. It can be hard to find but the dogs can detect it through carpet and wall panelling. ‘It takes a couple of minutes for the dog to search a room. People are slightly dubious when they first hear about us but after seeing what we can do they’re amazed.’ Prices start at £200 for a call-out and the business has been so successful Mr Doggett plans to expand it by training the dogs to hunt out bed bugs for hotels and hospitals.

"'Secret stuff': Ivana Chubbuck, 62, is a part therapist and part acting coach, known as the 'celebrity whisperer' She is known as the 'celebrity whisperer', a woman whose astonishing skill in honing Hollywood talent made an icon out of a man who used to stand on street corners dressed as a chicken. Today, Brad Pitt is known the world over. Ivana Chubbuck's client list includes Eva Mendes, Charlize Theron, Gerard Butler, Halle Berry, Sharon Stone and many others. So powerful are her methods, she reduced Beyoncé Knowles to tears within five minutes. And within months, the singer was topping the charts with Single Ladies. Part therapist, part acting coach, and very Hollywood, Chubbuck, 62, runs a hugely successful drama school in Los Angeles. She hosts workshops around the globe, as well as in the wood-panelled library of her £3 million home. Beyoncé went to Chubbuck when she was about to play legendary soul singer Etta James in the movie Cadillac Records and was looking to be taken seriously as an artist. Despite her professional success, Beyoncé was also at what she termed 'a pivotal point' in her life. 'I'm about empowering people,' Chubbuck told The Mail on Sunday in a rare interview – one which goes much further into her methods, and her clients' responses, than she usually allows. 'Beyoncé is a black girl from the South, that is her world. Like everyone else on the planet, she has issues. But once she faced those issues and realised she could use them in a positive way in her art, she flourished.' Apparently it's all about the 'secret stuff' that Chubbuck's clients tell her. Certainly it is well known that Beyoncé's relationship with her domineering father has been fractured for years. 'I told her to open up, to really get in touch with her feelings and what was going on inside her,' Chubbuck said. 'She started to feel her secret stuff and we start having a dialogue about it and she became emotional. We were crying together. She tapped into that well of pain inside her. 'She rang me up after we'd worked together on the movie and said, 'Listen to my new record – it's all the stuff you taught me.' And that's when she came out with Single Ladies and all the great female empowerment songs. The little pop star turned into a global icon.' When we meet at Chubbuck's home, model and actress Eva Mendes is just leaving after a three-hour 'intensive session' for her new movie with Ricky Gervais called Special Correspondents. Clients: Chubbuck works with some of the biggest names in show business including Beyonce (left) and Eva Mendes (right) Eva's Prada dress in pale orange . Shop the designer at Saks Fifth Avenue! Visit site . Esmeralda! We LOVE it. And we've a feeling little Esmeralda might be a little style icon in the making, just like her mum. So what that in mind, it's time to revisit one of our favourite Eva Mendes looks. This woman can wear what she likes. Even in bold shades of orange she still manages to look flawless, which is why we've decided to take some autumnal inspiration from this premiere perfect look. She wore this orange Prada dress back in March of 2013, but we still can't quite get over it. It's floaty, feminine and gorgeous. Eva teamed this orange number with a lighter hue satin shoe, which added another texture and dimension to the look. We would definitely suggest a strappy, metallic heel with this. So, if you're keen to update her look for the new season, check out our pick of the best colour-popping dresses (below). We'll be donning Mango's layered mini dress with a leather biker jacket to see out the summer in style. Mango Chiffon Ruffle Dress . Visit site . Boohoo Laura Curve Column Dress . Visit site . Bec & Bridge Isis Angle Dress (now on sale for $178!) at Revolve . Visit site . Carven Crêpe de Chine Dress at Barneys . Visit site . So what did that amount to? Mendes said: 'Ivana's technique could be boiled down to: take the pain in your life and find the most effective way to accomplish a goal with it.' In other words, your guess is as good as mine. Mendes continues: 'It helps you understand humanity – what drives someone to do what they do, good or bad. It's not painful… it's cathartic.' Chubbuck first met Brad Pitt when he was working as a promoter for a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit, and tells a story of a young man so driven by a desire to succeed that he had no life aside from acting. Today, he is still a client and Chubbuck worked on his most recent movie, Fury. She made an icon out of Brad Pitt, who when she met him was working as a promoter at a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit . 'Brad always had a work ethic that put others to shame,' Chubbuck said. 'He studied and worked. I would pair him up with a partner and many of those partners would ask to be changed because Brad wanted to rehearse a scene three, four, five hours a day. He was dedicated to his craft. He had no social life. He had his stupid job and the rest of the time he was studying with me. 'For the major talents, fame is never the driving force. Brad worked his butt off, he's taken risks over the years and when he fails he gets back up and works harder. He makes bold choices and isn't afraid to fail.' So what is the secret? Chubbuck says her technique is based on delving into your 'deepest, darkest past' and then using those negative feelings to positively portray a character on screen. Some of this is outlined in a best-selling book The Power Of The Actor (Gotham Books) which has been translated into 18 languages. Stars such as Kate Bosworth, Camilla Belle, Elisabeth Shue and Mendes have given the tome glowing reviews. Mendes said: 'It is my bible – I don't leave home without it.' Chubbuck recently returned from a working trip to London and says the phenomenon of British actors dominating Hollywood (Eddie Redmayne, Benedict Cumberbatch, Daniel Craig) is 'because Brits have a great work ethic and are not afraid to take risks or make fun of themselves'. Do her celebrity friends such as Matthew Perry, James Franco and Jake Gyllenhaal ever expect star treatment? 'Bottom line is they are with me to work,' Chubbuck says. 'Celebrity goes out the window. I'm about stripping them bare. The one thing I have learned over the years is that all of us have the same needs and wants as human beings. 'It doesn't matter if you are in London or the Philippines. There's a shared human story – we all want love, we all have issues with our spouses or partners, with our parents. The key thing is taking the bad stuff and not being a victim. 'You have to use that stuff to empower yourself.'"

"Working as a warden in Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park, home to the endangered mountain gorilla, Edwin Sabuhoro was determined to do whatever was necessary to protect the animals he was committed to defend -- including putting himself in harm's way. Following a series of incidents in 2004 where wildlife had been lost, Sabuhoro volunteered to infiltrate poachers on their own turf by disguising as a potential buyer for a baby gorilla. The mission was successful and the culprits were put to prison. ""I felt so bad that I had put these people in jail -- but I felt so good that I saved a baby gorilla,"" recalls Sabuhoro, whose next move was to visit the jailed poachers, as well as their families, to apologize for tricking them and find the reasons behind their actions. What he heard was stories of starvation and desperation. Poaching, he found, was the only way for these people to survive. ""That's when I decided that what I was doing was not part of giving a solution to what is wanted outside the park,"" says Sabuhoro. He quickly decided to quit the job and come up with an idea to help poachers make a living -- a plan that didn't include killing wildlife. ""I thought of an idea of turning poachers to farmers,"" says Sabuhoro, who took all of his savings -- $2,000 -- and divided it to poachers to rent land, buy seeds and start farming. ""I left them with that and they started farming, and when I came back six months after I found they had harvested enough -- they had enough food at home, but they were [also] selling more in the markets."" But Sabuhoro wasn't finished. While talking to tourists who came to visit the volcanoes, Sabuhoro came up with an idea to capitalize on their interest in the area, and provide work for former poachers. ""I started a tour company called Rwanda Eco Tours, and I said for tourism to thrive in the country we need eco-tourism where tourists can give back to the community and then the communities will have an incentive to conserve the park. So we built a cultural village in 2006 -- before we finished, we had tourists visiting us."" he says. ""In 2010, we got $30,000 net income from the cultural village and put this back to different activities in the village level."" Sabuhoro, whose work with the cultural village has received international recognition, including a chance to briefly meet U.S. president Barack Obama as a Young African Leader, is now trying to take his idea further to other national parks across Africa where poaching is causing similar problems. ""If we can work together, on a regional level, continent level, we can save these species,"" he says. ""Because these are the last species that we have. And as human beings we can't afford to fail the wildlife."" Watch this: Meeting the men who poach Rwanda's gorillas . Watch this: Flourishing community protects gorillas . More from African Voices ."
"Michael Fallon said the date for cutting the first steel would safeguard hundreds of skilled jobs until 2035.
He also announced that a contract for two new offshore patrol vessels would be signed shortly, securing jobs before the Type 26 frigate work is under way.
Unions welcomed the news but said the UK government had not delivered on all promises made to the Clyde shipyards.
Mr Fallon also announced a £100m contract with the consortium MBDA to deliver the Sea Ceptor missile defence system for the ships.
The Type 26 frigate is principally designed for anti-submarine warfare and will partially replace the current Type 23 frigate.
Each ship will carry a crew of 118, have a top speed of more than 26 knots and a range of 7,000 nautical miles. The first vessel is due to enter service in the early 2020s.
An £859m initial development deal to build the combat ships, at BAE's Govan and Scotstoun yards on the River Clyde in Glasgow, was signed in February 2015.
But the project has been scaled back from an initial 13 ships to eight and hit by repeated delays, with concerns that jobs could be lost as a result.
Mr Fallon, who is visiting the BAE yard at Govan, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the announcement was a ""huge moment for the Clyde"".
""We are confirming we are going ahead with the steel cut next summer, quite a bit earlier than some suggested, of the first of the eight Type 26s that we pledged to in the strategic defence review last year,"" he said.
""This is work for the next 20 years building these eight Type 26 anti-submarine frigates.""
The defence secretary added: ""We also hope to conclude, before Christmas by the way, the negotiations on the two offshore patrol vessels that were also promised in the strategic defence and security review last year, which will help fill in the gap before the work on the Type 26 starts.""
The promise of new Royal Navy orders to secure the Clyde shipbuilding industry was made before the Scottish independence referendum in 2014.
The number of planned new frigates was later scaled back from 13 to eight in the Strategic Defence Review, with the MoD now planning to build five smaller Type 31 warships in addition to the Type 26 fleet.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcomed the announcement but pointed out that it was not the same deal that was promised before the referendum.
""The promise hasn't been kept in full, so the number has reduced and there has been a real delay in getting this work started,"" she said.
Ms Sturgeon described the delay as ""regrettable"" and ""disappointing"" and said it had been a source of anxiety for the workforce at both yards.
She added: ""Nevertheless, it's a welcome announcement and I really hope now that it doesn't slip any further and that the commitment that has been made today is delivered in full.""
Gary Smith of the GMB union said it was ""fantastic news"" for the upper Clyde shipyards - though he said the UK government had not delivered on all its promises.
He told Good Morning Scotland: ""We were told there was going to be a 'frigate factory' built on the Clyde that would allow us to deliver ships more efficiently.
""It would perhaps have given us the facility to build ships that could be exported.
""And Michael Fallon in truth was dragged kicking and screaming to this announcement today after we exposed the fact that his government did plan to move some of the work originally planned for the Clyde, down south.
""But cutting through it all, great news for the workforce and great news for the economy in greater Glasgow as well.""
The Unite union said the announcement safeguarded shipbuilding at the two Clyde yards ""for the next generation"".
The union's regional coordinating officer, Kenny Jordan, said: ""Our members have been living with uncertainty for too long and this is a testament to the lobbying and campaigning that they have done over the last two years.
""We have a workforce at Govan and Scotstoun with world-class skills who are eager to get on with the job - and eager to see more work coming in the future.
""This announcement secures the future of shipbuilding on the upper Clyde, supports skilled jobs in manufacturing and will provide opportunities for apprentices and trainees, making sure that we safeguard skills for the next generation.""
The defence secretary said design work on the Type 31s was ongoing and he was unable to promise the work would come to the Clyde yards.
But he told the BBC that BAE systems would be in ""pole position"" to win the orders.
Work on the frigates was originally due to start this year. Unions raised concerns in April that up to 800 jobs could be lost at the Clyde shipyards if there was any backsliding on commitments.
The yards currently employ more than 2,500 people, though hundreds of jobs have been lost over the past two years as BAE has reduced shipbuilding capacity.
Scottish Economy Secretary Keith Brown also welcomed the news as a ""tribute to the skilled and dedicated workforces at Govan and Scotstoun"", but criticised the ""continuing wait"" for the MOD's basing review in Scotland to be completed.
The Scottish government has written to Mr Fallon asking for a meeting to discuss plans for base cuts in Scotland, with sites like Fort George and Kinloss facing an uncertain future.

"At first sight it might appear shocking that a clapped-out car such as this would be on the market for almost a quarter of a million pounds. But the dishevelled-looking vehicle is a celebrated 1962 Aston Martin DB4 Series III and will be worth three times its £220,000 price if fully restored. Despite its appearance it remains an attractive prospect for many car enthusiasts by offering the rare chance to restore a virtually-untouched DB4. Opportunity: Many car enthusiasts would jump at the rare chance to restore this virtually-untouched 1962 Aston Martin DB4 Series III . Pricey: The restoration project will cost upwards of £350,000 - meaning whoever buys it will have to pay £570,000 to return it to its former glory . Inside: The car, registered as BTB 478A, is being sold at Bonhams' Aston Martin sale in Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, on May 9 . But the restoration project will cost up to £350,000 - meaning whoever buys it will have to pay at least £570,000 to return it to its former glory. There were about 1,100 DB4 Series III cars made from 1958 to 1963 - and it is becoming tougher to find one that offers a restoration project. The British vehicle was supplied new in July 1961 to a Robert Drummond of London, who lived in a central postcode region in the capital of SW1. The car - to be auctioned in Buckinghamshire - was off the road in storage when bought by the unnamed current owner in 1982 as a restoration project. Work was carried out the next year - including the engine being stripped, fully rebuilt and a new chassis fitted - but it has hardly been touched since. The owner, who lives in the North West of England, has now decided it is time to part with the car that has not been driven in three decades. Steering wheel: The Aston Martin was off the road in storage when it was bought by the unnamed current owner in 1982 for restoration . In the boot: The engine was stripped, fully rebuilt and a new chassis fitted in 1983 - but the DB4 vehicle has hardly been touched since . How it could look: A file picture of a 1959 Aston Martin DB4. There were about 1,100 DB4 Series III cars manufactured from 1958 to 1963 . A spokesman for auctioneers Bonhams said: ‘We are advised that the Aston is completely original and comes with all components including the original leather interior, the latter in good condition. Someone has had a go at restoring it but for whatever reason never saw the project through. 'It has not been on the road since the work was done. Offered for completion and sold strictly as viewed, this is a potentially most rewarding restoration project. ‘If you take the car to Aston Martin to restore the most expensive bill you will get will be £350,000. ‘Today a fully restored Aston Martin DB5 can be worth between £500,000 to £750,000 and DB4s are slightly behind them.’ The car, registered as BTB 478A, is being sold at Bonhams' Aston Martin sale in Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, on May 9. The Mail On Sunday reported last month how private bank Coutts said the value some classic cars rose 257 per cent between 2005 and 2013. Last year an investment research organisation said the value of 'exceptional historic' cars climbed 12 per cent in that year alone. Compared with the beginning of 2009, prices had shot up by 163 per cent. With some Ferrari prices peaking, their total gain was 9.7 per cent compared with 24 cent for some sought-after Porsches."
"Britain's Prince Harry arrived Monday in Australia, where he'll be spending four weeks with the country's military. Before reporting for duty, the 30-year-old prince visited the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, the capital, paying his respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier. A crowd of onlookers gathered outside the memorial. Some snapped photos of the royal visitor, while one boy held a sign celebrating the prince's hair color: ""Red Heads Rule!"" During his time down under, Harry ""will work and live alongside colleagues in the Australian Army in a number of regiments in Sydney, Darwin and Perth,"" the Australian Defence Forces said last week. He has already spent time with Australian troops on a number of occasions during his 10-year military career, according to a royal spokesman. ""Prince Harry has trained and served alongside Australian armed forces on operational tours to Afghanistan; he has met them during the Invictus Games; and even trekked to the South Pole with a couple of Australian soldiers,"" the spokesman said ahead of the visit. The younger son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, Harry is known in the British Army as ""Captain Harry Wales,"" from his official title and name, His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales. He began his formal military duties in 2005 at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Last month, he announced that he would be leaving the armed forces in June, describing the decision as ""really tough."" Australian military officials say the prince's program with them will be ""challenging."" It will involve training in urban settings and patrolling the Australian bush, as well as aviation activities and fire exercises. He'll also participate in regular activities such as physical training and pack marches. Another focus of Harry's visit is to spend time meeting wounded, injured and ill service members in Australia. ""Wounded warriors"" are a special interest for Prince Harry. He helped spearhead and continues to champion the Invictus Games, a competition for former military personnel who have been wounded in the line of duty. During his attachment with the Australian military, Harry will accompany Charles on a trip to Turkey at the end of April for commemorations on the anniversary of the World War I Battle of Gallipoli."
"The news that Jurgen Klopp will leave Borussia Dortmund in the summer has raised the probability that key members of his squad will depart too. Klopp has painstakingly built a team in his image during his seven-year tenure at the Westfalenstadion and achieved considerable success. Dortmund were Bundesliga champions in 2011 and 2012 before they reached the final of the Champions League in 2013. Jurgen Klopp has announced he is to quit Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season . Klopp has enjoyed seven successful seasons at the Westfalenstadion but has decided to call time . But the signings of Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski helped Bayern Munich re-establish their dominance and Klopp's exit is the end of an era. It could signal the break-up of the Dortmund squad and we take a look at four players who could follow Klopp out of the club this summer. MATS HUMMELS . Even before Klopp's shock announcement, it looked highly likely that Hummels would be leaving at the end of the season, most likely to Manchester United. The Germany World Cup-winner is considered one of the best defenders in the game and would add steel to any back line. Klopp revealed recently that Hummels, 26, had been 'thinking things over,' adding that he believed he was good enough for United. Defender Mats Hummels has been linked with a move to Manchester United this summer . ILKAY GUNDOGAN . The 24-year-old midfielder has also been linked with a summer move to the Premier League, with Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City among those interested. At his best, Gundogan can take control of a midfield battle and is more than capable of unlocking defences with his range of passing. He hinted in February that he was ready to sign a new contract but then stalled and Klopp's departure could make up his mind for him. Midfielder Ilkay Gundogan has been linked with a number of Premier League sides . CIRO IMMOBILE . The Italian striker only arrived at the Westfalenstadion from Torino last summer but hasn't lived up to expectations as Lewandowski's replacement. A measly return of 10 goals for the season has hardly compensated for the loss of their star striker to Bayern last summer. There have been suggestions that Dortmund will listen to offers for Immobile and he would most likely return home to Italy, perhaps to AC Milan. Ciro Immobile (left) has struggled to compensate for Robert Lewandowski's departure to Bayern Munich . NEVEN SUBOTIC . The Serbian defender had ears burning in the Premier League when he said last week that he won't decide his Dortmund future until after his summer holidays. He also added they he yearns to play in a league that is more physical, saying: 'How can I do my work when my opponent starts crying without contact?' Subotic has been linked with Manchester United and Arsenal, offering a possible alternative if Hummels doesn't want to make the move. Defender Neven Subotic celebrates scoring in the German Cup quarter-final with Hoffenheim ."
"Don't insult the object of your desire with promises you both know you can't keep.
If you lack the cash for that magnificent bunch of fragrant roses, resist the temptation to brandish a fraying fake bouquet instead.
There has to be a better alternative, and you're unlikely to get a positive response.
And as for trying to bully or force someone into partnership with you - a little tip: it's unlikely to go down well.
In this respect, the EU makes a lousy suitor.
After reeling in panic and reacting in slow motion to the - to an extent predicted - dramatic surge this year in refugees and other migrants arriving, the EU is now trying a more comprehensive, strategic approach.
It includes an attempt to persuade (woo/push) the migrants' countries of origin, or the transit countries, to:
Migration to Europe explained in graphics
The EU also plans to send cash and other aid ""over there"", in the hope of dissuading more refugees and others from wanting to reach Europe, risking their lives.
A rather similar formula worked for Spain several years ago when it was the main EU arrival point for people smugglers' boats.
Bilateral deals with Morocco and Mauritania significantly reduced the arrival of ""pateras"", as Spaniards nicknamed those boats.
But Spain came under fire from aid organisations (NGOs) at the time for trying to make African countries the ""gatekeepers of Europe"".
The NGOs also raised concerns about possible human rights abuses against would-be migrants blocked at the border.
They complained that the bilateral agreements, sorely lacking in transparency, smacked more of backroom deals.
Similar concerns are now being directed at the EU as a whole.
This week, the EU hosted a summit in Malta with African nations, in the hope of coming to an ""understanding"" on slowing the flow of migrants to Europe.
But, in addition to NGO concerns (such as the risk of groups linked to human rights abuses, like the Eritrean security forces, siphoning off money allocated to stop migrants), African leaders widely dismissed EU offers of cash and other aid, as far too little to tackle the root causes of migration.
As flowers go, the extra aid package doesn't even make the gaudy plastic category.
The EU offered €3.6bn ($3.9bn; £2.5bn) to improve life in a number of African countries.
This in addition to the €20bn it already gives in aid to Africa.
Somalia's distinctly unimpressed Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke put it to the BBC that Africa needed investment, not charity, to improve its economies. The same as the US, the EU or anywhere else in the world, he said.
In fact, EU countries couldn't even muster the pledged extra cash. It's a promise they seem unable or unwilling to keep.
The European Commission says it will put in €1.8bn and wants the rest of the new fund made up by individual European nations.
So far they've coughed up less than €80m.
The EU was also unable to persuade/charm - some say bully - African countries into automatically receiving deported migrants back.
Instead, in the written summit conclusions, the EU was forced to emphasise ""voluntary repatriations"". That prompted obvious questions about the bloc's declared aim of ""speeding up the return"" of economic migrants and other failed asylum seekers - a key part of its plan to tackle the migrant crisis.
In short: the summit was not a resounding success.
And a number of European newspapers were critical of the EU even trying to make a deal.
Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung says the EU's offer of money to reduce the refugee numbers from Africa could open the EU to accusations of ""showing its real values by co-operating with unjust regimes"".
Similar objections are raised when it comes to EU attempts to strike a deal with Turkey - now the main departure point for refugees and other migrants crossing to Europe.
EU leaders are planning a Turkey summit before the end of the year, but - as German Chancellor Angela Merkel has pointed out - ""Ankara holds the cards"".
And diplomats worry that Ankara will demand an extravagant bouquet in terms of money and political concessions - such as lifting visa restrictions, and accelerating Turkey's EU membership bid - in exchange for help on migration.
And again, critics challenge the EU for courting Turkey at all - a country with an imperious president and dismal human rights record.
There are also those who say the EU's focus is far too fixed on creating ""Fortress Europe"", on keeping people out and not on introducing legal ways for them to come to over.
Because come they will.
The European Commission expects about three million refugees and other migrants to arrive in Europe by 2017.
Clearly, whatever the EU does during this crisis, it will come under fire from some quarter or another.
All too often, it comes up against itself - a behemoth of 28 nations, struggling to work together.
Even the quota system - accepted (reluctantly) by most EU countries - to share out more equally the asylum seekers in Europe is an unmitigated flop so far.
Agreed number of people to be relocated: 160,000.
People moved to date: 147.
Cross-border co-operation is disintegrating as barbed wire goes up and borders slam shut across Europe: in Slovenia, Hungary, Austria, Sweden, Norway…
Even Germany is toughening border regulations.
In stark contrast to the warm welcome given to hundreds or thousands earlier this autumn, Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany's hugely popular finance minister, has begun to mutter darkly about a migrant ""avalanche"" engulfing his country.
There's little evidence of the EU - more of each country for itself.
That prompted the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, to warn that Schengen, the EU agreement allowing passport-free travel across much of Europe, risks collapse. Yet it is one of the EU's proudest achievements.
You could argue Schengen has already wilted and died."
"Emmanuel Adebayor is sometimes branded 'eccentric' by pundits, writers and fans alike. After the Tottenham forward posted a video of himself performing a strange jig in front of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, it is not hard to see why. The bizarre post on Adebayor's official Instagram account emerged on Sunday, just a few days after the Togo international had taken to Twitter to insist he was committed to fighting for his place in the Spurs team. Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane, but his inconsistent form has led to few assurances over his future. Maverick Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor performs a strange dance in front of the Arc de Triomphe . The Togo international posted the video of him dancing in front of the Paris landmark on his Instagram account . He joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for £5million the following summer. Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October. Factor in the remarkable rise of academy graduate Harry Kane and it is easy to see why some sections of supporters have written Adebayor off as surplus to requirements.

"This spot in Colorado's Vail Valley is so picturesque that a family stopped at nothing to build their home here - even if it meant shelling out $1 million just on the driveway. The Italian-inspired mansion, which has incredible 360-degree views across the mountains, has now gone on the market for a tidy $29.5 million. Homeowner Dick Rothkopf, a former toy company chief, chose the location for the estate in 2008 because his family enjoyed hiking in the nearby hills. But the property is so remote that it took two years, a team of engineers and $1 million to build the 1.5-mile driveway from the roadway to its front door, the Wall Street Journal reported. Incredible: This Italian-inspired mansion in the mountains of Vail, Colorado has gone on sale for $29.5 million . Stunning: The home, which was built in 2008, is made from materials brought over from the homeowner's trips to Italy . Spacious: Inside the 13,000-square-foot home is a spacious gourmet kitchen, which is perfect for entertaining guests . Opulent: The entire property has eight bedrooms and eight full bathrooms over two buildings, as well as an outdoor barn . European: The luxurious home is known as 'Il Podere' - which means 'family homestead' in the Tuscan region . No details were spared at the 17,000-square-foot estate itself, either. The home, which is known as 'Il Podere' - meaning 'family homestead' - was built on 230 acres of land using materials collected during the Rothkopfs' trips to Italy. It features a main residence with seven bedrooms, seven full bathrooms, three half bathrooms, an elevator and a gourmet kitchen across 13,000 square foot. There's also a billiard room, a gym, an indoor basketball court and a home theater. Outside is a pool with a spa and sauna, a pool house, a two-car garage and a tennis court, as well as a lake, a pond, a stream and stunning views. Comfortable: A massive fireplace in a living room offers comfortable nights in for humans and pets alike . Hidden: Beneath arches and down walkways are recreation rooms for both children and adults . Airy: Large windows and terraces give terrific views across the Vail Valley in Colorado . Beautiful: As well as an office, the main home has seven bedrooms and seven full bathrooms . Fully equipped: A large gym can also be found at the home, as well as a spa and a sauna . Luxury: There is a movie theater inside the home, as well as a billiard room and an indoor basketball court . Serene: The home is 25 minutes from Vail's ski slopes and less than two hours from Aspen . Picturesque: The family who built the property chose this spot in Vail because they enjoyed hiking there . There is also a 2,000-square-foot caretaker's house, with one bedroom and one-and-a-half bathrooms, while a separate barn also houses a loft and a bathroom. And if the home itself doesn't offer enough entertainment, it's just 25 minutes from Vail's ski slopes, an hour and 45 minutes from Aspen and two hours from Denver. The listing with Douglas Elliman calls the estate 'breathtakingly beautiful, tranquil, pristine'. The family is leaving to build a home in Sonoma, California but plans to buy a smaller place in Vail so they can still make use of its slopes. Large: As well as a separate building for a caretaker, the estate also has a barn with a loft and a bathroom . Determined: Its current owners were intent on living at the location so built a $1 million to the house . Vistas: A swimming pool and terrace area gives unobstructed views across the valley . Restful: There is also a spa and a sauna at the home, as well as a separate one-bedroom caretaker's house . Great outdoors: The estate, which also has a stream and pond, stretches across nearly 17,000 square foot . Secluded: The driveway, which is a mile and a half long, took a team of engineers and two years to build . Incline: The lengthy driveway also takes visitors up 700ft towards the sprawling estate ."

"Jane Bell, from Galashiels in the Scottish Borders, got into difficulty at the Dalmeny Hotel in St Annes on 14 August 2014.
She was swimming in the hotel's main pool with no flotation devices when she went into the 7ft (2m) deep end.
Staff had received no emergency response training, the inquest heard.
The girl had been in the water for almost two minutes when former lifeguard and hotel guest Carole Greenwood dived in and brought her onto the poolside.
CCTV footage of the rescue and revival attempts by Mrs Greenwood and off duty paramedic James Pendlebury were shown to the inquest.
Paramedics initially took Jane to Blackpool Victoria Hospital before she was transferred to Royal Manchester Children's Hospital in a critical condition, where she died.
Leisure centre manager Tom Bird told the hearing that, at the time of the girl's death, the hotel's health and safety practices were dealt with by an outside consultancy.
Emergency response training for hotel staff began two months after the drowning, he said.
Jane's parents chose not to attend the inquest, which continues at Blackpool Town Hall."
"Scientists found a single dose of the protein Hi1a worked on lab rats.
They said it showed ""great promise as a future stroke treatment"" but had not yet been tested in human trials.
The Stroke Association said the research was at its early stages but it would ""welcome any treatment that has the potential to reduce the damage caused by stroke"".
The researchers, from the University of Queensland and Monash University, travelled to Fraser Island in Australia to hunt for and capture three potentially deadly Australian funnel web spiders.
""We regularly collect spiders from Fraser Island off the south coast of Queensland,"" explained lead researcher Prof Glenn King.
""The reason for this is that funnel-web spiders dig burrows that can be as deep as 20-30 cm. Thus, digging them up from hard clay soils is very difficult. Fraser Island is a sand island which makes it easy for us to extract the spiders from their burrows.""
The team then took the spiders back to their laboratory ""for milking"".
This involved coaxing the spider to release its venom, which could then be sucked up using pipettes.
Next the scientists dissected the venom gland of the spiders and honed in on a protein in the venom to recreate a version of it in their lab.
They then injected this Hi1a into the lab rats.
A stroke is a brain attack that happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off or there is bleeding on the brain
Source: Stroke Association
They found that the protein blocked acid-sensing ion channels in the brain - something the researchers say are key drivers of brain damage after stroke.
Prof King said the protein showed ""great promise as a future stroke treatment"".
""We believe that we have, for the first time, found a way to minimise the effects of brain damage after a stroke.
""Hi1a even provides some protection to the core brain region most affected by oxygen deprivation, which is generally considered unrecoverable due to the rapid cell death caused by stroke.""
The research was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
""My lab is interested in developing drugs for human nervous system disorders. Many of these disorders involve either dysfunctional ion channels (e.g. epilepsy) or over-active ion channels (chronic pain and stroke).
Thus, we are typically looking for molecules that modulate the activity of ion channels. The venoms of small venomous invertebrates such as spiders, centipedes and scorpions have evolved to target the nervous system of insects, and consequently they are absolutely full of ion channel modulators.
Because the human nervous system is more complex and wired differently to insects, ion channel modulators that kill or paralyse insects can actually be beneficial to humans. Thus, looking in venoms for ion channel drugs is not as weird as it seems.""
Dr Kate Holmes, deputy director for Research at the Stroke Association, said: ""We do not have an accurate picture of what happens in human brains from this research, therefore, it is currently unknown if this could be a successful treatment option for humans in the future.
""We welcome any treatment that has the potential to reduce the damage caused by stroke, particularly if this can benefit people who are unable to arrive at hospital quickly.
""Current treatments must be given in half this time period, and it is too early for us to know if this research can offer an alternative for stroke patients.
""We urge for stroke to be treated as an emergency - the sooner a person can get to hospital after a stroke, the sooner the right treatment can be received, which can improve survival and help recovery."""
"A group of eight-year-old children in New Jersey have written letters to convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal, wishing that he will 'get better soon' while recovering in hospital from a mystery illness after being encouraged by their teacher. The cards have caused outrage and alarm among political commentators, many of whom claim the 60-year-old's illness is a fraud and clamor for attention. Abu-Jamal, who shot Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in cold blood in 1981, was taken to hospital on April 2 after collapsing in the bathroom of the State Correctional Institution at Mahanoy. But this week he was delivered two batches of letters - one from a third grade class in Orange, New Jersey and another from high school students in the Philadelphia Student Union. 'Get well soon': Third graders in Orange, New Jersey, and high school students in the Philadelphia Student Union have sent Mumia Abu-Jamal letters wishing him well after he was hospitalized last week . Delivery: Johanna Fernandez (right), a professor of history at Baruch College, delivered Mumia Abu-Jamal a batch of letters from two different schools in hospital. He is pictured here also with (from left) Abdu Jon and Pam Africa . Ill: Mumia's supporters say photos of the prison journalist released this week by his wife show how ill and frail he is. Untreated diabetes is said to be the reason for Abu-Jama's hospitalization last week . The letters were delivered by Johanna Fernandez, a professor of history at Baruch College, according to Education Action Group News. 'We shared a touching moment with Mumia in an effort to raise his spirits,' Fernandez reported. 'Two teachers delivered letters to us that their students had written to Mumia.' 'It had been a long time since we had seen Mumia smile. 'He chuckled as he read excerpts from these touching letters.' The letters themselves or what they said were not released. However the fact they were written and then sent has infuriated many. Richard Costello, political coordinator for the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, said the letters set a dangerous example. 'I think its both alarming and outrageous that any teacher would use a group of innocent seven-year-olds to promote a twisted agenda glorifying murder, glorifying hatred and glorifying violence,' Costello told Fox News. 'He shot (the officer) in the back and then as the officer lay slumped against a wall helpless he leaned over and shot him between the eyes. 'When he was in the hospital he actually bragged about it.' Controversial: Marylin Zunig, a teacher at Forest Street School in Orange, New Jersey, had her third graders wrote letters to Mumia Abu-Jamal. The letters have subsequently sparked outrage . Costello said all the teachers involved in the letter writing campaign should be fired. 'Furthermore all the parents who have children in that school system need to reevaluate that involvement, because these children are now placed in danger by the very people charged with their education,' Costello said. 'They are being used as tools in someone's twisted agenda.' Costello has previously described Abu-Jamal as 'the devil'. The official reason the convicted killer was hospitalized has not been released. However reports say he was suffering high blood sugar levels. Attorney Bret Grote with the Pittsburgh-based Abolitionist Law Center said last week that his client was placed in the critical care unit of Schuylkill Medical Center in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Grote says neither he nor Abu-Jamal's brother, Keith Cook, had been allowed in to see him. 'We're concerned, about as concerned as it gets, about Mumia's health,' Grote told the Philadelphia Inquirer. Hospitalized: Convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal was placed in the critical care unit of a Pennsylvania hospital last week after collapsing in prison . A Pennsylvania Department of Corrections official also declined to provide details. A spokesman for Pottsville's Schuylkill Medical Center says he had no information about Abu-Jamal. 'We never discuss an inmate's medical condition,' deputy press secretary Susan Bensinger told the Inquirer. Mumia's hospitalization was revealed Monday when a group of his friends arrived to the State Correctional Institution at Mahanoy for a visit and were informed by prison staff that he wasn't there. While Grote and others had permission with the prison to visit Mumia, the hospital had not yet cleared them. Grote said he hoped the matter would be cleared up by Tuesday. Abu-Jamal is a former Black Panther serving life in prison for the 1981 murder of white Philadelphia police Officer Daniel Faulkner. Treated: Lawyers with Pittsburgh-based Abolitionist Law Center say prison officials told them their client was being treated at Pottsville's Schuylkill Medical Center . His conviction was upheld through years of appeals, but he has gained international support for his claim that he's the victim of a racist justice system. Mumia's death sentence was overturned in 2012. Abu-Jamal supporters include celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg, and many hail him as a revolutionary. Abu-Jamal has written several books, hosted his own radio show and even has a street named after him in France.

"In December 2014, self-styled Islamist Man Monis held 18 people inside the cafe in the central business district.
The CCTV footage shows heavily armed police entering the building's foyer at 2:14 local time on 16 December and setting off a number of flash grenades.
Monis died after he was shot multiple times, but that is not shown in the footage.
A hostage, Katrina Dawson, was also killed in the raid by a ricocheting police bullet.
How the Sydney siege unfolded
The raid was triggered when Monis shot the cafe's manager, Tori Johnson, in the back of the head after ordering him on to his hands and knees.
The footage shows the officers filing through a door into the cafe and bringing out hostage Robin Hope.
Earlier on Tuesday, the inquest saw CCTV footage of six hostages scrambling out of the cafe as a shot blasted through a nearby wall.
Sophie Callan, counsel assisting the coroner, said it was believed that Monis was trying to shoot the hostages, and not firing a warning shot as previously thought, according to the ABC.
It was one of several escapes by hostages during the siege.
The coroner's inquest into the Lindt Cafe siege is entering its concluding stages."
"Defeated: Napoleon (illustrated) lost at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 . Guests attending a service in London to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo have been told not to act in a 'triumphalist' way – to avoid upsetting the French. Invitations to the service at St Paul's Cathedral advise that it will avoid glorifying the Duke of Wellington's historic victory over Napoleon in 1815. But last night the move was criticised by politicians, who said it 'took political correctness to an absurd new degree'. The invitation to the Waterloo 200 event says: 'The service, although related to a military victory, is not in any way glorifying war, nor must it be seen as triumphalist.' Instead, the service – to be attended by members of the Royal Family and senior political and military figures – will focus on the 'pan-European' implications of the battle and the century of peace that followed. Conservative Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is bidding to be re-elected as a Somerset MP, said: 'Waterloo was a triumph of good versus evil. Napoleon was responsible for between three million and 6.5 million deaths. 'Two hundred years on, it is ridiculous to spare the blushes of the French by not celebrating the battle for what it was. What next? Will we ask France to apologise for the Battle of Hastings?' The service of commemoration, to take place on the 200th anniversary of Waterloo on June 18, will be the centrepiece of a series of events to mark the battle. Waterloo 200 chairman, Major General Sir Evelyn Webb-Carter, defended the 'no triumphalism' theme. Asked if it looked as though the service was designed to avoid embarrassing the French, he said: 'Some people may read it like that but it's not how we look at it.' He added that the enemy at Waterloo was Napoleon – not France as such. The commemoration was highlighting the effect of the battle on Europe, not the military campaign or the battle itself. 'What Waterloo brought in was an extended period of peace in Europe after a particularly horrible 20 years of war,' Sir Evelyn said. 'The commemoration looks forward to the European harmony that followed it.' Colin Brown, author of Scum Of The Earth, a new book about Waterloo, said Wellington would not have objected to the non-triumphalist tone. He added: 'The Duke strongly believed in the restoration of the status quo after the battle, including the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France.' The commemoration was highlighting the effect of the battle (illustrated) on Europe, organisers said ."
"Mr Haldane, added that any rate rise would ""increase unnecessarily the chances of the economy falling below critical velocity"".
He is considered to be the most cautious policy-maker when it comes to raising interest rates.
Interest rates have been at 0.5% since 2009 and the financial crisis.
The first increase is now expected in late 2016. Forecasts were put back after the Bank of England's last inflation report in which the Bank said the outlook for global growth had weakened.
In a speech to trade union body the TUC, Mr Haldane also indicated that the next rate move could equally be a cut rather than a rise.
""Now more than ever in the UK, policy needs to be poised to move off either foot depending on which way the data break,"" he said in his speech.
Mr Haldane said that because wage growth could be weaker than currently expected, inflation may undershoot the Bank's November predictions, when it estimated that inflation would rise above its 2% target in two years.
The Consumer Price Index currently stands at 0.1%.
""Against that backdrop, my view is that the case for raising interest rates is still some way from being made,"" Mr Haldane said.
""Whatever the reason, the economic aircraft appears to be losing speed on the runway. That is an awkward, indeed risky, time to be contemplating take-off.
""Meanwhile, inflationary trends do not at present give me sufficient confidence that inflation will be back at target, even two years hence.""
Mr Haldane also had strong words on the UK's increasingly expensive housing market.
""The UK housing market is broken,"" he told the TUC meeting.
""There is a chronic and accumulated imbalance between demand and supply, and it is that which is sending skyward - and has sent skyward - house prices."""
"Former Arsenal and England defender Sol Campbell is part of a new campaign to encourage minorities to register to vote in next month's general election. Campbell has joined forces with Homeland actor David Harewood, musician Tinie Tempah and Paralympic medallist//television presenter Ade Adepitan. The campaign, run by Operation Black Vote, features the stars in striking photographs ahead of the voting registration deadline on April 20. Sol Campbell is part of a new campaign to encourage minorities to register to vote for the General Election . Ex-England star Campbell retired from football in 2012 and is considering a career in politics . Campbell, 40, last month ruled out standing for the Conservatives in Kensington after Sir Malcolm Rifkind announced he would be standing down. At the time he said his 'ambitions lie elsewhere in the political arena' which led to speculation he could run for London Mayor. Campbell posed for a photograph with his face coloured white alongside the caption, 'If you don't register to vote, you're taking the colour out of Britain.' And on launching the campaign, Harewood said: 'What it brilliantly illustrates is that if you don't register to vote, you are quite literally taking all the vibrancy we have in our community off the table . 'If you don't register to vote, politicians don't really care about you, politicians aren't really caring about what you have to say, what you have to do, anything. Campbell won 73 caps for his country, scoring one goal over the space of nine years . 'The only way they talk to you is if you register to vote. That is when you become an important part of the electorate.' Operation Black Vote also launched a 2015 general election manifesto with the aim of 'reclaiming democracy, empowering citizens and fighting race equalities'. It says that in the past black and minority ethnic (BME) groups presented a broad range of 'key policy demands' to all parties, but adds: 'Our experience shows that whilst all parties express interest in our proposals during elections, this interest soon evaporates once in power.' Instead OBV has created a list of manifesto points of its own, including automatic voter registration linked to the National Insurance system, the introduction of e-voting and proportional representation, voting from the age of 16, state funding of parties and a 'minister for race equality' in the Cabinet.

"Masters champion Jordan Spieth is back to work this week at the RBC Heritage Classic after two days celebrating his victory at Augusta National and being showered with attention. Spieth arrived at Sea Pines Resort late Tuesday night after a media whirlwind in New York since tying Tiger Woods' Masters record of 18-under 270 to capture the green jacket. The 21-year-old said it was a dizzying stretch with 26 appearances and interviews in 25 hours. 'It was a little crazy in New York having paparazzi know where we were going to eat dinner even though we never told anybody,' Spieth said Wednesday. Spieth doesn't believe the success will change him. In fact, he said he upheld his commitment to the RBC Heritage in part to chase down Rory McIlroy for world No. 1. 'I wouldn't come to a tournament just to come to a tournament, especially with that goal still in mind,' said Spieth, who moved to No. 2 in the world rankings with the Masters' win. Jordan Spieth returns to golf just days after winning the Masters and will play in the RBC Heritage Classic . Spieth has had two victories and two runner-up finishes in his past four events. He would have liked to have had his normal pre-tournament preparations at Harbour Town Golf Links. Instead, he'll go into his first-round tee time Thursday not having played a hole of practice on the tricky, Pete Dye-designed layout. 'I'm sure Jordan's wiped,' said Kevin Streelman, the Par-3 contest winner at Augusta National last week who finished tied for 12th behind Spieth. 'But he's 21 years old, he can handle it.' Spieth has had success here the previous two years, finishing ninth in 2013 and 12th last year. The RBC Heritage gave him an invite two years ago when Spieth was a rising, yet largely unknown 19 -year-old trying to make his way on tour. The top-10 finish, Spieth said, helped his confidence and status on the PGA Tour. 'This tournament helped with job security,' Spieth said. 'So it's a tournament that's close to me and I love it here.' The 21-year-old was in formidable form at Augusta and equaled Tiger Woods' tournament birdie record . Most Masters champions - and many of the game's best players - take the next week off after a pressure-packed week at Augusta National. Spieth heads a group of five ranked in the top 20 of the world (No. 10 Jim Furyk, No. 14 Patrick Reed, No. 17 Matt Kuchar and No. 19 Billy Horschel are the others) to compete this week. Streelman enjoys playing right after a major, knowing his game is honed in and peaking after a Grand Slam event. 'Your game is really primed and amped up,' he said. 'I'm very prepared.' Kuchar is the tournament's defending champion, holing out from a green-side bunker on the 72nd hole to defeat Luke Donald by a stroke. Spieth's success has him atop the FedEx Cup standings, the youngest player ever to lead that category. Spieth celebrates after putting the winning hole and winning the Masters at such a young age . There have only been two Masters winners the past 15 years to follow up their victories by playing Harbour Town. Vijay Singh tied for third here in 2000 a week after winning the Masters while Zach Johnson was sixth in 2007. Only Bernhard Langer is 1985 followed a Masters victory with a triumph a week later at the RBC Heritage. Spieth believes he'll be the same driven, focused competitor he's always been after winning the major he dreamed of as a child. That might be difficult after this week's spotlight. Spieth got congratulatory Tweets from stars like Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant and about 200 texts and emails since the victory. 'Given some time, that will subside a little bit,' he said. What won't ease up, Spieth said, is his desire to achieve the very best in golf, a quest that continues at Harbour Town. 'I was very much looking forward to getting back here, getting on solid ground and taking a deep breath,' Spieth said. 'I'm really looking forward to this week.'"
"EVERYONE’S A WINNER . Good news for all the struggling low-paid pros who made it to the Masters. The green jackets took pity on them by announcing a 10 per cent increase in prizemoney for this year’s tournament. The winner’s share of the $10million pot worked out at £1.23m in our currency. Anyone who made the cut was guaranteed £17,000. Jordan Spieth collected £1.23million for winning the Masters - as well as the coveted green jacket . POULTER’S PURPLE PATCH . Ian Poulter improved on his previous best Masters finish by shooting a second straight 67 for a share of sixth. Wearing a loud purple number, Poulter reflected on a missed chance. ‘The way I’ve played at the weekend was a highlight,’ he said. ‘It was about the missed shots on Thursday and Friday. I left myself too much work to do.’ Ian Poulter was dressed all in purple on Sunday for his final round at Augusta . NO STONE UNTURNED . Augusta National have had people positioned on four holes this week taking note of everything — what club each player uses from the tee. the shape of shots, the type of shots played to the greens and whether players tee off from the left side of the tee or the right. All interesting info before considering any course changes in future. Patrons watch the action on the sixth green at the Augusta National as Phil Mickelson plays a shot . HOTTEST TICKET IN TOWN . What was it worth to watch Tiger and Rory go head to head for the first time in the final round of a major? One of the plethora of touts outside the grounds quoted me $4,000 for a pair of tickets. McIlroy duly deliverd with a wonderful 66 with Tiger carding a 73. Imagine what it would cost if they were paired together in the final group? Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy were paired together for the final round at Augusta on Sunday . PHIL’S THE MAN IN BLACK . Phil Mickelson opted for an all-black outfit  on day four in an unusual bid to try and improve his performance. ‘I like to wear dark colors on Sunday,’ he said. ‘I’ve won three times wearing a black shirt so I’ll wear a black shirt. It helps me get more aggressive. Studies have shown that when NFL teams wear black they have more penalties.’ Phil Mickelson was dressed all in black on Sunday as he tried to win the Masters for a fourth time . DANNY DISAPPOINTED . When you hole a 64-foot putt on your first round at Augusta, a little disappointment is understandable if you can’t maintain those standards. England’s Danny Willett hit three rounds of 71 but his third of 76 proved his undoing. ‘It’s a bit disappointing,’ he said. ‘My ball-striking is good but I couldn’t take advantage.’ England's Danny Willett hit three rounds of 71 at the Masters but was let down by one of 76 ."
"Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood kept faith with Jack Grealish, the 19-year-old academy graduate, after handing him his first Premier League start against Queens Park Rangers a fortnight ago. The young midfielder did not disappoint, playing a part in Christian Benteke’s equaliser and then setting up Fabian Delph’s winner. ‘The bigger the stage the better he plays, the more he relishes it,’ said Sherwood who saw Grealish outshine Liverpool’s experienced internationals Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson in midfield. ‘That’s the sign of a good talent.’ Jack Grealish runs at Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel in a game where he adapted well to the big stage . The youngster had a hand in Christian Benteke's goal as Aston villa stunning Liverpool at Wembley . Grealish could not wait to share his excitement with Villa fans, tweeting it was the ‘Best feeling of my life!!’ and posting pictures from inside the victorious dressing room. Sherwood added: ‘Jack’s someone I looked at before I was at the club and when I’ve seen him in training, if you give him an instruction he sticks to the plan. He’s got a big future at the club.’ Grealish, who wears children’s shinpads and socks rolled down, won two free-kicks for his team through dribbling with the ball. ‘He’s very durable,’ said Sherwood. ‘You should see the size of his legs, he’s still a kid. He takes more kicks in training than he does on the pitch so he’s getting a lot of practice fending off kicks — he probably needs bigger pads!’ Grealish (right) a posted to Twitter of him celebrating with Fabian Delph (left) and Gabriel Agbonlahor . Grealish was noticeable for having his socks rolled down, and wears children's shin-pads ."
"One Israeli citizen was killed and another injured in what police are calling a suspected terror attack Wednesday night near Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Israel Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said a 37-year-old Arab motorist from East Jerusalem struck two people standing at a bus stop in the French Hill section of the city. One victim, identified by police as Shalom Yohai Cherki, 26, died at the hospital. A 20-year-old woman remains in serious condition, according to Rosenfeld. The driver has been arrested and is under investigation by the General Security Services. ""From the investigation and first findings, there is a strong suspicion that we're talking about a terror attack,"" Rosenfeld said. Amid the ongoing investigation, a magistrate court has issued a gag order on details of the incident."
"A head teachers' conference has heard claims of threats such as dead animals being left in school playgrounds.
""Trojan Horse has not gone away,"" said Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson, head of Anderton Park School in Birmingham.
Responding to the claims, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: ""There is no place for extremism in our schools.""
The National Association of Head Teachers' annual conference in Liverpool heard warnings that problems over extremism remained unresolved and schools could still face pressure on issues such as tackling homophobia.
The so-called Trojan Horse inquiries followed allegations that there were organised attempts by hardline Muslim groups to undermine head teachers and take over schools in Birmingham.
Head teachers at the conference complained that no governors had been barred as a result of the inquiries and they called for a database which would identify individuals removed from governing bodies.
Ms Hewitt-Clarkson told the head teachers' conference: ""Trojan Horse has not gone away. Those of us who were involved, we knew it was the tip of the iceberg.
""We still have dead animals hung on the gates of schools, dismembered cats on playgrounds. We have petitions outside schools, objecting to teachers teaching against homophobia.""
There were threats on social media, she said, such as ""Any head teacher who teaches my children it's alright to be gay will be at the end of my shotgun.""
Ms Hewitt-Clarkson said she knew of a school which had found a dismembered cat in the playground, while another had a dog hanging from the railings.
Head teachers warned that despite the high profile reports following the Trojan Horse claims, the response had been inadequate.
Alison Marshall told the conference: ""Despite all the evidence we have, we're faced with a situation where not one single governor implicated in the Trojan Horse scandal has been investigated or even banned. Where is the justice in that?""
And Ms Hewitt-Clarkson warned that the problems underlying the Trojan Horse claims could ""start up again"".
""All the behaviours and things we saw before are still there. So too have promises that have been broken,"" she told the NAHT conference.
There were particular concerns about the lack of scrutiny over the role of governors, highlighted by the Trojan Horse inquiries.
Tim Gallagher told delegates the lack of regulation meant it was ""blindingly obvious"" that there would be problems with governing bodies.
""Many, many of our members have suffered greatly from rogue governors,"" he said.
The conference carried a motion calling for a national register of governors who have been removed or barred so that schools and local authorities can check the suitability of governors.
The BBC revealed earlier this year that there is no central record of governors held by the Department for Education, which would also show people serving as governors in multiple schools, one of the concerns raised in the Trojan Horse inquiries.
Mrs Morgan, responding to the heads' warnings, said: ""There is no place for extremism in our schools and we continue, absolutely, to work to eliminate any form of extremism.""
But the Conservative education secretary said: ""This is a reminder that this is a serious issue and something that is not going to be solved overnight.
""We have taken action to remove and continue to take action to remove people from being in schools who don't follow British values."""
"A Muslim women's rights advocate and outspoken critic of Islam has championed the U.S. as the best country in the world to live as a  woman and as a black person. Somali-born author Ayaan Hirsi Ali, 45, emigrated to America in 2006 after facing death threats in the Netherlands, where she had been a member of parliament and a target for extremists after renouncing her faith and becoming an atheist. Hirsi Ali, who describes herself as a liberal, has accused her fellow liberals of failing to have a proper sense of perspective about life in the U.S. and for not being more critical of Islam. Muslim women's rights advocate and outspoken critic of Islam Ayaan Hirsi Ali has championed the U.S. as the best country in the world to live as a woman and as a black person . 'We are so blessed as women to live in the United States. The best place to be a woman in the world is in the U.S. The best place to be black in the world is in the U.S.,' she told The Daily Beast. 'Is it perfect? No. Are we confronted with threats? Yes. But it's the perfect place to fight [them] off.' Ali said that the law in the U.S. and the fact that the majority of the population are accepting of differences make it easier for all types of minority groups including woman, black people, gays and Jews. 'I cannot imagine what it is like to be a black man living in Saudi Arabia, in Iran - even where the majority of people are black, like Africa,' she said. 'I cannot imagine a better place to be gay than in the U.S. I know that all European countries have accepted gay marriage and here in the U.S. we're still struggling to accept that. 'On the other hand, when the jihadists in Europe attack gays in the streets, the governments don't protect them. 'The best place to be Jewish in the world, besides the state of Israel, is in the U.S. The best place to be Christian is in the U.S.' Hirsi Ali was raised in a strict Muslim family, but after surviving a civil war, genital mutilation, beatings and an arranged marriage, she renounced the faith in her 30s. Hirsi Ali is married to British historian and public commentator Niall Ferguson, right, who left his wife of sixteen year for the Somali intellectual . Hirsi Ali releases her new book, Heretic: Why Islam Needs A Reformation Now, later this month . In 2007, she helped establish the AHA Foundation, which works to protect and defend the rights of women in the West from oppression justified by religion and culture, according to its website. The foundation also strives to protect basic rights and freedoms of women and girls. This includes control of their own bodies, access to an education and the ability to work outside the home and control their own income, the website says. Hirsi Ali told The Daily Beast that in comparison to the rest of the world woman in the West have little to complain about. 'Listen, if you're not allowed into a golf club, that doesn't sit well with me, but if I were to prioritize, I would say: This girl, she's just been denied her right to school, she's just been forced into marriage, she's just been genitally mutilated. That's the sort of thing that we need to be, as women, signing up against.' Hirsi Ali releases her new book, Heretic: Why Islam Needs A Reformation Now, later this month. The book includes her thoughts on the January shootings in Paris at the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. Her previous books include the best-selling memoir Infidel. She has written and spoken extensively of her experience as a Muslim girl in East Africa. She moved to the Netherlands as a young woman, and she was later elected to the Dutch Parliament. She wrote the screenplay for Submission, a 2004 film critical of the treatment of Muslim women. Shortly after its release, the director, Theo van Gogh, was murdered on an Amsterdam street by a radical Islamist, who also pinned to the victim's body a threat to kill Hirsi Ali. She is married to British historian and public commentator Niall Ferguson, who left his wife of sixteen year for the Somali intellectual. They married in September 2011 and Hirsi Ali gave birth to their son three months later."
"The former Rangers captain will join Killie on a three-year deal to team up with boss Gary Locke at Rugby Park.
McCulloch, 37, was deemed surplus to requirements at Ibrox after Rangers' new management team of Mark Warburton and David Weir arrived in June.
The former Wigan Athletic midfielder won three top-flight league titles and two Scottish Cups with Rangers.
McCulloch, who played many of his 46 games for Rangers last season in central defence, joins striker Kris Boyd and full-back Stevie Smith in making the move to Kilmarnock from Ibrox this summer.
Scotland international McCulloch was involved with Locke in Kilmarnock's preparations for Saturday's friendly against Berwick Rangers.

"Turkish forces have targeted so-called Islamic State (IS) inside Syria, but have also gone after Kurdish fighters in the same region.
The pursuit of Kurdish forces, whom Ankara considers terrorists, has led to criticism by the United States.
Ankara contacted the US ambassador on Wednesday over comments the foreign ministry called ""unacceptable"".
A US military spokesman had expressed hopes on Tuesday that, rather than see Turkey pursue Kurdish fighters, ""all parties involved are going to stop shooting at each other and focus"" on IS.
On Wednesday, Russia added its voice, with the foreign affairs ministry calling on Turkey to avoid strikes in Syria on opposition and ethnic groups fighting Islamic State, including Syrian Kurds.
""Turkey is a sovereign state, it is a legitimate state,"" said Turkey's EU Affairs Minister Omer Celik.
""To suggest it is on a par with a terrorist organisation and suggest there are talks between them, that a deal has been reached between them, this is unacceptable.""
Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said on Wednesday that ""operations will continue until all terrorist elements have been neutralised, until all threats to our borders, our lands and our citizens are completely over"".
The foreign ministry phoned US ambassador John Bass on Wednesday morning.
While Ankara and Washington are allies, the US depends on Kurdish forces for support in attacking IS in northern Syria.
However, Turkey has insisted Kurdish militia, which it regards as terrorists, retreat east across the Euphrates river.
Turkey has been fighting a Kurdish insurgency in its south-east for decades and fears Kurdish gains in northern Syria will fuel Kurdish separatism at home.
Turkish forces and allied factions of the rebel Free Syrian Army (FSA) forced IS out of the Syrian border city of Jarablus a week ago and have since pounded neighbouring villages held by Kurdish-led, US-backed Syria Democratic Forces (SDF).
The Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG), which dominates the SDF, says its forces have withdrawn, and that the Turkish action against the group was a ""pretext"" for occupying Syria.
At the weekend, the US Defence Secretary Ash Carter called on Turkey to stay focused on the fight against IS and not to engage the SDF.
He said the US was ""very supportive"" of Turkey's general counter-IS activities and its efforts to secure the border - but not the area south of Jarablus.
Separately, a spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised EU states for their response to a failed coup in the country last month.
Ibrahim Kalin said it was unacceptable that EU countries had not sent high-level representatives to Turkey after the coup attempt, which the presidency says was planned by supporters of Fethullah Gulen, a powerful US-based Muslim cleric.
EU officials had spoken of their concern at a crackdown led by Mr Erdogan on state institutions in the wake of the coup attempt."
"Children as young as four have been investigated for drug and sex offences - and toddlers aged just two suspected of assault, it was revealed today. Shocking figures from West Midlands Police also show a nine-year-old has been probed on suspicion of criminal damage and a four-year-old questioned over an assault. Between 2009 and 2014 a total of 617 youngsters aged under ten in the region either committed, of were suspected of committing, a crime. Investigated: Between 2009 and 2014 a total of 617 youngsters aged under ten in the West Midlands either committed, of were suspected of committing, a crime, according to figures (file picture posed by model) They include 41 nine-year-old boys investigated for crimes last year including five suspected of sexual offences, according to the details released after a Freedom of Information Act request. A nine-year-old girl was also linked to a case of criminal damage while a five-year-old girl was alleged to have committed sexual activity with a child. The legal age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is ten. But four-year-old children have also been investigated on suspicion of possessing cannabis, criminal damage, assault, theft and sexual activity with a child aged under 13. In both 2013 and 2014 two-year-old boys were believed to be behind assaults and in 2012 a three-year-old girl was suspected of being responsible for a theft. Publication: West Midlands Police (whose headquarters in Birmingham are pictured) released figures showing that in both 2013 and 2014 two-year-old boys were believed to be behind assaults . Police admitted some of the figures may be inaccurate - including statistics showing a rape suspect aged minus three, and a one-year-old breaching a non-molestation order. A boy of 13 became one of Britain's youngest murderers after he was jailed for at least 12 years for killing a woman he had just mugged by stamping on her face so hard it left a footprint on her cheek. CCTV footage showed the horrendous moment Petri Kurti murdered 47-year-old Glynis Bensley before he fled to a nearby park in Smethwick, West Midlands, and boasted about the savage attack. The schoolboy, who was named last Friday after a judge lifted a reporting restriction order, will be on licence for life. Sentencing, Judge John Warner said he had been 'running wild' in his home life. A force spokesman said: ‘The response features information collated in good faith from millions of pieces of data stored on force systems which, on reflection, contains some inaccuracies as a result of human inputting errors at the time of the crime being recorded.' He added that the FOI response was released with the following caveat: 'Although every effort is made to ensure the figures presented are accurate and complete, the data collected is subject to inaccuracies inherent in any large-scale recorded system. ‘As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when interpreting those data. ‘Data on ages is calculated from date of birth, which is inputted manually. Therefore inaccuracies may result from human error.'"

"On trial: Former Ukip MEP Ashley Mote (pictured arriving at London's Southwark Crown Court today) is accused of a string of fraud-related offences . A former Ukip MEP fraudulently claimed almost £500,000 in European Parliament expenses - using some of it to fund his domestic court battles, a court heard today. Ashley Mote, 79, of Binsted, Hampshire, is accused of a string of fraud-related offences including acquiring criminal property and obtaining a money transfer by deception. Some of the money he allegedly made from the fraud went towards funding various legal costs he had built up as a result of being prosecuted in the UK for benefit fraud offences, a jury at London's Southwark Crown Court was told. He denies 11 offences alleged to have taken place between November 2004 and July 2010. Jonathan Davies, prosecuting, said that as an MEP, Mote could claim expenses, including a Parliamentary Assistance Allowance, or Secretarial Allowance, to help fund his work. Mr Davies said: ‘What the prosecution say happened between 2004 and 2009, when Mr Mote ceased to be an MEP, is that he abused that allowance by submitting false claims for payment for work which he said to the European Parliament had been done by organisations working on his behalf.’ Jurors heard that two of the organisations had previously campaigned against UK membership of the European Union. They were the Better Off Out Fund (Boof), and Direct Action Resistance To Tyranny (Dartt). However, it is alleged that neither of these companies conducted any work for Mote, who made claims of £16,000 against Boof, and £54,000 to Dartt. ‘They were simply used as a front to perpetrate, carry out fraud and to receive monies from the European Parliament,’ said Mr Davies. European Parliament in Brussels: Prosecutors claim Mote was 'using European Parliament money to fund his defence and various appeals in connection with being prosecuted for benefit fraud' Mote is also said to have falsely claimed £5,000 a month for work he claimed had been carried out by Estonia based company Icos (Information Centrum Owned State). It is alleged that he even set up a Danish bank account under the similar name of ‘Information Centrim OS’ for funds from the European Parliament to be paid into, ‘dishonestly obtaining’ approximately €355,000. Giving details of Mote carrying out fraud to fund his rising legal bills, Mr Davies said: ‘He asked for payments to be made to the firm of solicitors on the basis that they were providing him with advice in relation to his duties as an MEP. ‘In fact the money was being used to fund a number of criminal and civil proceedings related to Mr Mote's prosecution for benefit fraud offences, and indeed some unrelated civil proceedings. ‘Basically we say he was using European Parliament money to fund his defence and various appeals in connection with being prosecuted for benefit fraud.’ Mr Davies continued: ‘This was a sophisticated fraud committed over several years during which Mr Mote made a number of false representations and produced a number of false documents in order to deceive the European Parliament into believing that significant amounts of work were being done on his behalf, relating to his work as an MEP. Pleading not guilty: Mote (pictured again today) allegedly fraudulently claimed almost £500,000 in expenses . ‘In total he dishonestly obtained approximately €355,000 and £184,000 of allowances to which he was not entitled. It's not quite half a million pounds, but it's not far short.’ Jurors heard that while MEPs were allowed to make certain legitimate claims for expenses from the European Parliament, they were not supposed to use this money to enrich themselves. Between 2004, when he was elected MEP and 2009, Mote claimed a total of £750,000 in Parliamentary Assistance Allowance, taking into account his legitimate claims and any alleged fraudulent activity. Mote was elected a Ukip MEP for South East England in 2004, but shortly before he actually took up his seat was thrown out of Nigel Farage's party because he was being prosecuted by the Department for Work and Pensions for benefit fraud. However, he sat as an independent MEP until 2009, when he decided not to stand for election. The court heard that in April 2004 Mote's case for alleged income support, council tax and housing benefit fraud was sent to crown court to be dealt with, and he was elected as an MEP two months later. Elected as MEP: Mote (pictured in 2006) was thrown out of Ukip because he was being prosecuted by the Department for Work and Pensions for benefit fraud . But he made an application to the court saying that the criminal proceedings against him were a breach of his rights to free movement, as his bail conditions meant he could not travel freely to Europe. The courts agreed with this and proceedings against Mote were stayed, prompting the prosecution to make an application to the Attorney General to review the matter. Jurors heard that in light of this, Mote wrote to the manager of European Parliament allowances asking for expenses to allow him to fight this. He wrote: ‘I have to fund myself in the legal affairs committee against an attempt by the British government to unseat me as an MEP. This is going to incur legal costs.’ However, Mr Davies told the court that Mote did not disclose that he was being prosecuted for fraud. He said: ‘What Mr Mote doesn't say is something along the lines of “I am being prosecuted for fraud arising out of events prior to being elected as an MEP”.’ Jurors heard that the Attorney General overturned the decision and Mote was prosecuted and convicted of benefit fraud in August 2007. Mote denies four counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, three of false accounting, two of fraud, and one each of acquiring criminal property and concealing criminal property. The trial resumes at 10am tomorrow when the opening will continue. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."
"A pair of friends who battered a married father of two to death with extreme 'Jackass-style' pranks and dumped his dismembered body in a lake have been jailed for life. Neill Buchel, 39, was kicked, punched and bludgeoned by Elvis Kwiatkowski and Chas Quye, both 36, before being cut into ten pieces and disposed of in a fishing lake in Dagenham, Essex. The men were obsessed with the extreme pranks from the hit TV show and videos found on their mobile phones showed Mr Buchel being made to rub scotch bonnet chilli pepper on his genitals. Killed: Neill Buchel, 39, was kicked, punched and bludgeoned to death on March 13, last year, by two 'friends' Blackfriars Crown Court was told the South African was subjected to 'degrading and humiliating violence' that had become 'casual' in the months before his death on March 13, last year. Mr Buchel emigrated to Britain in 2001 with his wife and daughter where they wanted to start a new life after hearing stories from his grandfather, a Spitfire pilot in the Battle of Britain. But he was thrown out of the family home in late 2013 after he spiralled into an alcohol addiction and moved in with Scott 'Gary' Hunt, 42, and other friends. Instead of providing a haven for him, the group were puerile hard-drinkers who entertained themselves with extreme pranks, which Mr Buchel was made to endure. Other videos discovered showed Quye setting fire to his own pubic hair while eating a chilli and taking shots from a BB gun. On the night of his murder Mr Buchel had been drinking in the park before returning to Quye's flat with Kwiatkowski, who he had just met, Hunt and a fellow drinker, Alan Quinn. Jailed: Chas Quye (left) and Elvis Kwiatkowski (right) were sentenced to life in prison at Blackfriars Crown Court today. The court heard they were obsessed with the hit U.S. television show Jackass . Mr Buchel moved in with Scott 'Gary' Hunt, 42, (left) who was jailed for five years for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Bradley Andison (right), 47, who transported the body in a 4x4 was jailed for four years . One witness described seeing Kwiatowski and Quye, brandishing a mallet, standing over Mr Buchel whose head was draped in a sheet. A post mortem found he suffered over 30 blunt force traumas that caused 35 fractures to bones around his body. The following morning the pair set about dismembering the body before enlisting the help of the apartment owner, Hunt, to help them shift the body parts. The court heard how with no means to transport of the corpse the men considered using public transport to. Ian Morley QC, defending, Quye said: 'They were contemplating at one point of using a bus to move the body. That suggests the desperation to which their minds had gone to.' Alan Quinn, 28, present at the time of the murder but not involved was also convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and jailed for 3 years . They resorted to using a 4x4 owned by Bradley Andison, 47, from Kent, who pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice before the trial began. The whereabouts of Mr Buchel's corpse remained unknown for weeks after his death, until a young angler mistook his thigh for a dead fish in White Hart Lakes, Dagenham. Judge, Mr Justice Spencer, said: 'Had the body parts all sunk to the bottom of the lake and remained there it may never have been know what you did. 'This was as bad a case of its kind as it is possible to imagine.' Jailing the pair today, the judge added: 'This was a brutal and callous murder, Neill Buchel was 39 years old when he died. 'He was a harmless and inoffensive man, he and his wife had come to this country from South Africa in 2001 with their daughter, their second daughter born here, they wanted to make a better life for themselves. 'His wife and his children never for a moment stopped loving and caring for him. 'The family's loss has been insufferable, the girls have been deprived their father and any chance that they might one day have got back together.' Prosecutor, Sally O'Neill QC, read a victim impact statement by his wife Sharon to the hearing. She said: 'Neill Buchel had a particular fondness for England as his grandfather had been a Spitfire pilot in the war and Neill had enjoyed the stories he used to tell. 'She described him as a loving, caring, funny person who was completely harmless and gentle.' She said despite his trouble with booze he was ""amiable"", he had never been a violent person and a was a peace-loving gentleman who loved his daughters. 'It was her dream as she put it that they would be able to get back together again if he got better.' The court also heard a statement from Patricia Kell, Mr Buchel's mother, which said: 'Not only did they kill my son but they ruthlessly took away someone who we loved and cherished. Mr Buchel (left) emigrated to the UK with his wife Sharon (right) in 2001 but he moved in with friends in late 2013 after he spiralled into an alcohol addiction . 'The awfulness of knowing that they ruthlessly chopped his body into pieces, this child who I have loved, watched grow from a baby into a man, whole in body and soul, the absolute horror of this is indescribable. 'What they saw, and watched and handled, what they desecrated so callously was a loving human being worthy of respect even after death.' Who struck the killer blow was unknown, but Justice Spence said the was was a 'classic joint enterprise' and both were handed the same life sentence. He added: 'Both of you must have realised straight away that Neill Buchel was badly injured and needed urgent medical treatment, but neither of you did anything to help him.' Quye's involvement was made 'even worse' as he had told Mr Buchel's 16-year-old daughter, who cannot be named, the night before that he would care for her inebriated father, the judge said. Quye, who appeared in the dock with a string of rosary beads, and Kwiatkowski showed no reaction as they were ordered to serve a minimum term of 21 years and will serve the rest of their lives on licence. The judge said: 'This was an attack of great brutality and ferocity against a man who was quite unable to defend himself. Although both of you were under the influence of drugs you showed him no mercy.' Hunt, who was represented in court by the Prime Minister's barrister brother, Alex Cameron, QC, was jailed for five years for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice but cleared of murder. A fifth man, Alan Quinn, 28, present at the time of Mr Buchel's murder but not involved was also convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and jailed for three years. Andison was jailed for four years and a sixth man, Colin Bushaway, 61, was cleared of the charge and an alternative of preventing a lawful burial."
"Sir Alex Ferguson, the quiet years. No singular drive, no all-consuming discipline that keeps him on the go from pre-dawn ‘til the streetlights are burning bright. As this most honoured of sporting knights puts it himself: ‘I don’t have obsessions now.’ There’s certainly nothing that comes close to football for the famous Fergie, who has instead chosen to spend his retirement devoting himself to any number of causes; at last count, he was associated with a good dozen charities or foundations. And it will surprise no-one to learn that, while doing his bit for UNICEF, Barnardo’s et al, a little of the old firebrand spirit still burns brightly. If you want to build a statue to a Govan radical who led a rent strike and changed more than just her own wee corner of the world, Sir Alex is the man you call. Sir Alex Ferguson watches on from the stands during Manchester United's clash with Chelsea on April 18 . Ferguson, in Glasgow on Thursday to make a £5,000 donation to the Remember Mary Barbour Fund, actually physically writing out a cheque towards a permanent memorial, revealed that his life hasn’t so much slowed down as merely changed gear since he stepped down as Manchester United manager in the summer of 2013. The 73-year-old, who had lived and breathed football since making his senior debut at the age of just 16, was famous not just for the trophies won – his haul of 49 assorted cups and prizes making him easily Britain’s most successful ever manager – but the hours put in. Raised to believe that hard work was as necessary as breathing, Ferguson’s ability to push players hard was based at least in part on the example he set himself. That work ethic, simply part of his upbringing in Govan, isn’t something he’s let slide just because he no longer has one demanding day job. ‘What I’m doing is making sure I remain active,’ said Ferguson, looking trim and at ease. ‘That’s important when you retire, so I’ve got many things on my plate. ‘It’s funny, though. It’s a different kind of work. Whereas at United I was in at quarter to seven every morning, and be there to tea time every day, that was one constant thing all your life – I was doing one thing. Ferguson celebrates United's Premier League title victory in May 2013 with Rio Ferdinand . ‘Now I’m doing different things, which is maybe even more exhausting! There is no one thing, nothing like that. I don’t have obsessions now. I don’t get up at six o’clock in the morning, that’s for sure. I have a long lie now and again.’ Football is no longer the dominant factor in his life, with even questions on the game receiving short shrift, although – and this wasn’t always the case back in his managerial days - he was very polite in his refusal, answering the one out-of-bounds query by saying: Listen, Aberdeen are doing fantastic. They’ ve got a great manager and I love that club. But I’m here to talk about Mary Barbour. I don’t blame you for asking …’ Wherever Ferguson goes, he takes his native burgh with him, freely attributing a great deal of his sporting success to the lessons he learned either at home, at Harmony Row Boys Club or Govan High. ‘Your upbringing is important,’ he said yesterday, adding: ‘I think it’s the foundation of your life. I was fortunate enough to have good parents who did the best they could possibly do for me. ‘There are many people who have said I came from a poor background. I don’t think people brought up in my time thought they were poor. Ferguson and then Everton boss David Moyes shout instructions from the sideline at Old Trafford in May 2013 . ‘Talking about the role of the housewife and mother, they made sure the food was always on the table. That was the case with me. ‘You were always dressed the best way you could possibly be – and you were taught to be the best you can be. ‘That came not just from the parents but from teachers at school. That was their role. I don’t think necessarily education is about learning lessons in school. It’s about inspiring you. And I was inspired by many people.’ Ferguson wasn’t taught about Mary Barbour at school, admitting that he’d only come across her tale when looking through a book of historical Glasgow photographs complied by the great Harry Benson. Ferguson's haul of 49 assorted cups and prizes making him easily Britain’s most successful ever manager . Barbour famously led rent strikes in Glasgow at the height of the First World War, forcing a change in the law with the introduction of the Rent Restrictions Act. A consistent campaigner throughout her life, she went on to become one of the city’s first female councillors, the first female Bailie and female magistrate. The fund-raising campaign is aimed at building a statue of Barbour, to be erected on Govan Cross, Ferguson explaining his involvement by saying: ‘There was a connection with Govan, which is what stirred the real interest in me. ‘There is that great photo of all the housewives in Govan standing outside the close; that rent men was never getting in that close. That registers deeply with me. I’ve looked at that photograph many, many times. That is where my interest comes from – and it’s a great cause.’ For further information about the campaign please go to: RememberMaryBarbour.com .

"As if it wasn't bad enough having a job that involves routinely entering strangers' homes, these estate agents may have just been put off for life. As a part of Sky Living's promotion for its upcoming three-part drama, The Enfield Haunting, real London estate agents were invited to value a house in a viral video. What they didn't know, is that the house had been rigged with special effects to give the appearance of being possessed by a ghost. London estate agents were invited to a fake haunted house, where they were subject to terrifying pranks . Installed with secret cameras, microphones and booby traps, the unsuspecting estate agents are subject to cruel, but hilarious, pranks - which prompt hysterical reactions. An ordinary house in Enfield is chosen as the location, and to draw the estate agents in, is a pretend homeowner, Rosie, who wants her house valued. Upon entering the house, Rosie solemnly explains to the estate agents that the house was owned by her brother, who just so happened to also pass away in it. An ordinary house is chosen in Enfield for unsuspecting London estate agents to value . Cameras are installed the walls and members of the team monitor the hilarious reactions . An estate agent is invited into the house and greeted by the fake homeowner, Rosie. This already to serves to unsettle one estate agent, as his eyes widen in surprise. Once the scene is set, the funny pranks begin, and a shelf collapses randomly behind the estate agents. One reacts by literally leaping into the air and retracting his arms to his chest in a protective stance. Another startled estate agent lifts his hands up into the air in an automatic surrender position. Another gasps and raises her hand to her mouth, her shoulders jolting. Rosie (pictured right) explains to the estate agent (pictured left) that her brother recently died in the house. The estate agent looks nervous and unsettled . A shelf behind the estate agent collapses and he reacts with leaping into the air in shock . When the shelf collapses, another estate agent gasps, her shoulder jolting in shock . Already unsettled by the shelf, Rosie proceeds to lead them up the stairs, and gestures for them to look at the bathroom, while she attends to her phone ringing in another room. One of the estate agents is looking around, as the tap switches on by itself. As he goes to turn off the tap, it switches off by itself. Confused, he turns to leave the room, at which point the tap begins creepily running again, and again, turns off when he reaches towards it. In one room, marbles begin violently spilling out of one of the cabinets randomly. A combination of the noise and surprise causes one estate agent to shriek . As the marbles spill out of the cabinets, another estate agent throws his hands up in the air in surprise . He exits the room appearing puzzled and disconcerted. In the next shot, the estate agents are seen entering another bedroom, at which point marbles begin spilling violently out of one of the top cabinets, which is again met with hilarious reactions. As well as horrified screams and petrified stares from the estate agents, one of them throws his hands up in a surrender position, insisting: 'I didn't touch anything!' A cabinet randomly and violently topples over prompting a gasp from the estate agent . A woman is shocked as the cupboard doors begin rattling and things begin spilling out loudly . Frightened, another man turns around as the door slams violently behind him . Many of the estate agents are truly alarmed at this point and go in search of Rosie, the fake homeowner. Upon entering another bedroom, the team really begin to up the ante with the special effects. First a stocky wardrobe unit loudly topples over onto the floor, and the door creakily swings shut by itself. One woman presses her hand to her chest, truly gobsmacked and exclaims: 'Woah! ' Another man screams frantically for the owner of the house. A woman stares at the wardrobe doors in horror as they begin to open and close and things begin to tumble out . She appears horrified as the door slams by itself behind her, her arms crossed in a protective stance . One man decides to intervene in the ghostly occurrence and kicks the spinning chair angri . Several of the wardrobe unit doors begin rattling and opening randomly unassisted, with objects falling out, and a chair begins spinning on its own. One of the estate agents cowers in the corner, shakily running his hands through his hair and appears evidently faint. Another man comically kicks the spinning chair and shrieks: 'Get Out!' At this point, many can't take the strange disturbances any more and run down the stairs, where the team members are revealed and they are let in on the prank. With relieved expressions and nervous laughter, they seem grateful that there is in fact no ghostly presence. The estate agents are let in on the prank as the cameras are revealed. One in particular seems extremely relieved that it is all a joke . 'Genuinely, I thought it was real': One estate agent appears shaken from his fake haunting experience . One said: 'I'm actually speechless, like my heart's actually going.' Another insists: 'Genuinely, I thought it was for real.' The Enfield Drama will be based on bizarre poltergeist-related events that occurred at a council house in 1977. Starring Timothy Spall, the three-part drama, The Enfield Haunting will air on Sky Living on 3 May 2015."
"A spending timeline until 2022 shows the price could be about £435,000 more than approved in the Scottish Borders authority's budget earlier this month.
The Scottish government contribution to the project has been estimated at about £32.5m.
The council is being asked to approve the final outline design of the scheme and aim to publish it in April.
A report to the local authority described publication as ""the most important stage of the project for determining the programme and successfully obtaining funding"".
It warned that if the objection resolution process went beyond an estimate of three months, it could put funding at risk as well as the delivery target of June 2021.
However, the project team has tried to avoid that prospect with extensive consultation over the past two years."
"The 16-euro ($17.80; Â£11.60) fee is likely to deter travellers from completing bookings on services including Expedia, Opodo and ebookers.
It marks the latest effort by the airline industry to steer customers towards its own websites.
One expert said this not only helped cut airlines' costs but also allowed them to them promote add-on services.
However, the booking services suggest their own platforms are often easier to use and help keep prices low.
Lufthansa Group's move will affect tickets bought for Lufthansa itself as well as Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines and Swiss from 1 September.
There are two types of travel price comparison sites on the net:
Lufthansa's move is expected to be damaging to the former, while allowing its own site to appear the most attractive option on the latter.
""The distribution cost charge will drive up the cost of tickets booked via so-called online travel agencies like Expedia or Opodo,"" Martin Riecken, a spokesman for the German airline, told the BBC.
""However, it is not about... trying to discourage anyone from comparing prices.
""We rather aim for more transparency. Our rationale is twofold.
""Firstly, to allocate the high distribution cost of global distribution systems [the flight inventory and fare databases used by online travel agents] - we are talking about a high three-digit million euro amount per annum for the Lufthansa Group - to those that are actually using the services, instead of evenly distributing these cost to all passengers.
""Secondly, to take advantage of greater degrees of freedom in our sales activities, providing customers with the exact tailor-made service that they are looking for.""
Opodo said online travel agencies were opposed to the move and lawyers at the European Travel Agents' and Tour Operators' Associations (ECTAA) were looking into the matter.
""[This] is a global issue that affects all countries and worldwide travel agencies, traditional or online, corporate and leisure, and which is already being legally examined by the associations of European agencies,"" said a spokeswoman for the company.
""Lufthansa Group will clearly be the one whose most affected by this decision.
""The fact that they have not provided any automated alternative to the global distribution systems will cause Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines and Swiss to suffer a severe lack of competitiveness against other companies that are present in these channels and don't have an extra cost for the travellers.""
One industry watcher said Lufthansa might have felt it had to act to boost its earnings.
The company recently reported 55m euros of net profit for its last financial year, representing an 82% drop on the previous period.
Its services have also been disrupted by a series of pilots' strikes and the crash of one of its Germanwings flights in March.
""If you look at Lufthansa's recent performance, they have been through difficulties,"" said Laurie Price, an independent airlines consultant.
""So they've been looking at every way to increase their bottom line. There is only so much cutting you can do.
""A better way is to generate revenue. And if you can get sales direct and offer add-ons, then that's a much better way.""
Lufthansa Group's stock traded slightly higher following the announcement.
But shares in Amadeus - the Spanish travel booking technology company that serves Expedia, Opodo and others - closed the day 10% lower.
Lufthansa's action represents the latest in a series of clashes between airlines and price comparison booking services.
Last August, American Airlines briefly removed its flights completely from the online travel agency Orbitz in a row over fees.
More recently, the US Travel Technology Association complained that Delta Air Lines had removed its schedule and fare information from more than a dozen online travel agencies, including TripAdvisor, Fly.com and Hipmunk.
It added that the UK-based metasearch service Skyscanner had lost access to Delta's flights as a consequence earlier this year.
Skyscanner now points customers directly to Delta's site, benefiting the airline.
""Heightened attempts to lead travellers away from online travel agencies and metasearch travel sites is likely to lead to higher average airfares, increase consumers' search costs, make entry into city-pair routes by smaller airlines more difficult, reduce transparency, and strengthen the market power of the major airlines,"" a report prepared by a Yale professor for the Travel Technology Association said.
Delta responded saying it had the right to determine who it did business with."
"Andrew Steele, from Dunfermline, turned at a police station and confessed to and raping one girl and touching another between 1996 and 2005.
He was initially released pending further investigations but was detained months later. He then said he been hallucinating when he made the confession.
Sentence was deferred for background reports.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard that Steele, aged 49, told officers his mother was ""up in the sky"" urging him to confess to the sex crimes when he made his revelations.
Police traced the girls and took statements from them. Both victims were aged seven when the abuse began.
Steele admitted rape, indecency offences and failing to turn up for an earlier court date, when he appeared at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Advocate depute Mark McGuire said: ""On 28 December in 2014 the accused voluntarily attended at Kirkcaldy police station and disclosed that he had interfered with the girls.""
""On 3 March in 2015 the accused was detained. Under caution he told the officers that he was having hallucinations on the day that he confessed. He told them that his mother was up in the sky telling him to confess. He maintained this position throughout the interview.""
The prosecutor said before his first appearance at the police station Steele had gone to hospital and claimed he was hallucinating.
""He was assessed by three medical professionals who concluded that he was suffering from alcohol withdrawal. He was deemed fit to be discharged,"" said the prosecutor
Steele was remanded in custody and put on the sex offenders register."
"An unidentified male concert-goer has come under fire for his offensive choice of festival fashion after he was photographed at  Coachella wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words 'Eat Sleep Rape Repeat'. The snapshot, which shows the man giving the peace sign as he flaunts his controversial shirt  at the festival held in Indio, California, sparked outrage after it was shared on Twitter on Sunday by Jemayel Khawaja, the managing editor of Vice's music and culture channel Thump. 'This guy wins the award for worst fashion/lifestyle choices @coachella. I'm not easy to offend, but this is sh**** [sic],' he tweeted along with the picture. Tasteless choice: An unidentified concert goer has come under fire for wearing a T-shirt featuring the words 'Eat Sleep Rape Repeat' (pictured) to Coachella on Sunday . First person account: The offensive photograph was shared by Jemayel Khawaja, the managing editor for Vice's music and culture channel Thump . The distasteful choice of words on the concert goer's shirt are thought to be a play on the Fatboy Slim song Eat Sleep Rave Repeat, which was released in 2013. '@JemayelK I thought at first this said ""eat sleep rave repeat"" until I read it carefully. Wtf [sic],' one critic commented on Jemayel's post. Another added: '@JemayelK @hannahgais @coachella can't even understand why someone would think that's funny... Or wearable in public [sic].' There were some who were willing to give the unidentified man the benefit of the doubt however, suggesting that the image may have been edited in order to make the garment appear more offensive than it actually was. Shameful shirt: Many commenters on Twitter wrote that they were shocked that someone would wear such an offensive top in public . Misspelling: Sam Houston questioned whether the shirt was real or not, hoping that the unidentified male's shirt was meant to say 'Rage' instead of 'Rape' Shout out: Meanwhile, Ben Gomori chose to insult the wearer of the shirt, calling him a 'F****** p****' '@JemayelK @coachella Is that real? I imagine it was meant to say “RAGE”? [sic],' one critic asked, while someone else added: '@JemayelK please say that's photoshopped?? [sic]' But Jemayel confirmed that he had taken the snapshot and seen the shirt with his own two eyes after one Twitter user asked: 'Before I jump on the appropriate rage wagon, did you take this picture yourself?' 'Yeah I did. Rage away,' he replied. The shirt, which doesn’t appear to be sold online, may have been custom-made for the event. Meanwhile, someone else confirmed that another Coachella reveler had taken to Twitter on Sunday to share their disgust after running into the man in the controversial T-shirt. Fashion faux pas: Another Twitter user revealed that she also saw the man wearing the controversial T-shirt . Shake it off: But not everyone was upset by the shirt. This person criticized Jemayel and told him to focus on 'real issues' 'The most inappropriate shirt at #Coachella goes to the guy wearing one that says ""Eat Sleep Rape Repeat"" - what the actual f***? [sic]' she wrote. Although not everyone agreed with a majority of the public's outrage. One Twitter commented on Jemayel's photo, writing: 'If this offends you, you're a p****. Grow a sack and focus on real issues, not feminist honeypot garbage.' Amid the debate over the questionable T-shirt, the first weekend of Coachella came to a close last night after Madonna planted a kiss on Drake, who looked horrified after the impromptu make-out session. The music festival will start again on Friday with performances from ACDC, Azealia Banks, Alabama Shakes and more. If you know who this man is, email DailyMail.com at tips@dailymail.co.uk ."
"Watson, 22, is charged with an ""act contrary to good sportsmanship"", as well as tackling Alex Goode in the air.
The first offence alleges he used ""offensive, inappropriate and unprofessional"" language after being sent off.
Watson featured in every Six Nations game for England this year as they won their first Grand Slam since 2003.
England tour Australia in June and Watson's place may be in doubt if he is found guilty of a dangerous tackle at a hearing on Tuesday, with the charge carrying a top end sanction of 10 weeks.
If found guilty, the minimum punishment is a two-week suspension.
Former London Irish player Watson could face penalties ranging from a reprimand, to a financial penalty, or a suspension if he is found guilty of the unsportsmanlike conduct charge.
Bath - beaten finalists last year - are ninth in the Premiership table with four games left to play this season."
"Ceredigion-based Lewis Coaches, which runs buses from Aberystwyth to Cardiff via Carmarthen, is to shut on Friday.
The Confederation of Passenger Transport Cymru said 40 jobs were at risk.
Ceredigion council said it was working to continue some services.
The authority said plans were already in place to see the on-demand Bwcabus service and the 588 and 585 routes from Aberystwyth University to Lampeter taken over by other firms by Saturday.
But the council said it understood the 701 Aberystwyth - Carmarthen - Cardiff service would end on Friday and it did not know if another operator would take it on.
Lewis Coaches is the third bus company in Wales to collapse in the past two months, with 300 jobs lost when Wrexham-based GHA Coaches went into administration in July and Pembrokeshire firm Silcox Coaches, ceasing trading after 134 years in June."
"A mysterious 'ring of fire' has been spotted in space thanks to Albert Einstein's theory of relatively. The ring, located 12 billion light years away, is an illusion created by the chance alignment of two distant galaxies. The striking circular structure is a rare manifestation of gravitational lensing predicted by Albert Einstein in his theory of general relativity. Scroll down for video . Alma's image of the gravitationally lensed galaxy SDP.81. The bright orange central region of the ring - Alma's highest resolution observation ever - reveals the glowing dust in this distant galaxy . Gravitational lensing occurs when a massive galaxy or cluster of galaxies bends the light emitted from a more distant galaxy, forming a highly magnified, though much distorted image. In this particular case, the galaxy known as SDP.81 and an intervening galaxy line up so perfectly that the light from the more distant one forms a nearly complete circle as seen from Earth. Einstein's theory predicts that the gravitational effects of the nearer galaxy will bend the light of the more distant one. The Alma telescope in Chile was able to capture the effect in the highest resolution images ever taken by the observatory. In this particular case, the galaxy known as SDP.81 and an intervening galaxy line up so perfectly that the light from the more distant one forms a nearly complete circle as seen from Earth. Discovered by the Herschel Space Observatory, SDP.81 is an active star-forming galaxy nearly 12 billion light-years away, seen at a time when the universe was only 15 percent of its current age. It is being lensed by a massive foreground galaxy that is a comparatively nearby 4 billion light-years away. 'Gravitational lensing is used in astronomy to study the very distant, very early Universe because it gives even our best telescopes an impressive boost in power,' said Alma Deputy Program Scientist Catherine Vlahakis. 'With the astounding level of detail in these new Alma images, astronomers will now be able to reassemble the information contained in the distorted image we see as a ring and produce a reconstruction of the true image of the distant galaxy.' An AlmaHubble composite image of the gravitationally lensed galaxy SDP.81. The diffuse blue element at the center of the ring is from the intervening lensing galaxy, as seen with the Hubble Space Telescope . The highest resolution image of SDP.81 was made by observing the relatively bright light emitted by cosmic dust in the distant galaxy. This striking image reveals well-defined arcs in a pattern that hints at a more complete, nearly contiguous ring structure. Though this intriguing interplay of gravity and light in SDP.81 has been studied previously by other observatories, none has captured the remarkable details of the ring structure in such detail. 'The exquisite amount of information contained in the Alma images is incredibly important for our understanding of galaxies in the early universe,' said astronomer Jacqueline Hodge with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, Va. 'Astronomers use sophisticated computer programs to reconstruct lensed galaxies' true appearance.

"The African champions let in goals from Kerem Demirbay and Timo Werner, who netted twice, while Vincent Aboubakar grabbed a consolation goal for them.
The Indomitable Lions also had Ernest Mabouka sent off after confusion involving the Video Assistant Referee.
Sebastien Siani was initially dismissed in a case of mistaken identity before the error was corrected.
Colombian referee Wilmar Roldan consulted the VAR after a high challenge by Mabouka on Germany's Emre Can led to Cameroon captain Siani wrongfully receiving a yellow card.
However, the initial outcome was to switch the colour of Siani's card to red.
It was only after Cameroon's players insisted he review the incident again that he realised his error, rescinded Siani's dismissal and sending off the correct culprit Mabouka.
""The referee didn't give any explanation,"" said Cameroon coach Hugo Broos.
""First of all he gave a red card against Siani, then the video ref called him back and told him it was the wrong player, so Mabouka was sent off.
""Both players [Can and Mabouka] had their legs high, so I don't see why he had to give a red card. I think everyone is confused
""I didn't understand it and I still don't understand it now.
""I think this is something for the referee. He and he alone can explain what happened in that incident.""

"A man accused of chopping up his friend's body and dumping his severed head in an apartment block's recycling bin had previously started a bloody fight at his gym, it has emerged. Carlos Colina, 32, is being held on $1 million bail after pleading not guilty to aggravated assault and battery and improper disposal of a human body in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Monday. The remains of Jonathan Camilien, 26, including a torso and limbs, were found in a duffel bag near the campus of Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Saturday morning before his head was found in Colina's apartment building across the street, according to the police report. Now the Boston Herald has unearthed police reports and witness accounts showing Colina had intimidated fellow gym users and even fought them before being thrown out. Accused: Carlos Colina is pictured at his arraignment in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Monday after human body parts were discovered in a duffel bag and a head was found in his building's recycling bin . Colina previously worked out at the Cambridge Athletic Club but was kicked out following a fight over gym equipment on November 24. A witness told the Herald how Colina started punching a much smaller man all over his body as the man unsuccessfully tried to fight back. He suffered bloody cuts to his head, the witness said. 'The trainers broke the fight up,' he said. 'Carlos gets up and starts walking away, yelling, ""I'm a beast! I'm a beast!’ like he was proud of himself.' The victim suffered broken ribs in the attack, WHDH reported. Colina has an outstanding assault and battery case pending against him from the fight. The witness said that before the November incident, Colina stood and glared at other gym users if they were using gym equipment he wanted. 'Intimidating': Colina, pictured in photos he posted to Facebook, also has an outstanding assault and battery case pending against him after he allegedly attacked a fellow gym user last November . 'Threats': A witness said Colina had also intimidated other gym users when he wanted to use equipment . Colina is believed to have known his alleged victim; he is friends with his younger brother, Christopher Camilien, on Facebook. The two brothers lived together in Somerville. Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said Camilien's death is considered a homicide, even though Colina has not been charged with murder. She said analysis of evidence and more information from the medical examiner are needed to determine if additional charges are warranted. 'We are not seeking anyone else in connection with the discovery of these human remains,' she said. No motive has been released. Colina and Camilien were last seen returning to the building just after 11pm on Friday, according to the investigation, and a neighbor reported hearing an argument coming from the apartment. Colina was seen in surveillance video from nearby Biogen offices exiting the apartment building at about 4.15am on Saturday carrying a duffel bag, authorities said. Scene: A vacuum could be heard inside his building, pictured, after police discovered the victim's head . Probe: Police stand by where the remains of Jonathan Camilien were discovered in Cambridge on Saturday . He returned to the apartment building empty handed. A saw, rope and cleaning supplies were found in Colina's apartment, which is located one block from the Cambridge Police Department. He also had wounds on his face and neck and a vacuum could be heard during the search when police discovered the victim's head, according to theBoston Globe. Defense attorney John Cunha Jr. called it a sensational case. 'Obviously the circumstances of the case are sensational enough,' he said. 'I'm not going to exacerbate it.' A pretrial hearing has been scheduled for April 14."
"A jury of Rolling Stone's media peers has dissected the magazine's disastrous, discredited story about rape on the campus of the University of Virginia, and the emerging consensus is that Rolling Stone's lapses and sloppy blunders amount to journalistic malpractice -- made all the worse by the magazine's head-in-the sand reaction to the thorough, devastating report released by a panel of investigators from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Rolling Stone's egregious mistakes of reporting and editing are regrettable but understandable. The magazine's decision not to fire anybody or reorganize its newsroom operation is not. Before the original story, ""A Rape on Campus,"" was pulled from the Rolling Stone website, it registered 2.7 million hits following its publication in November -- more than any noncelebrity story in the magazine's history. An anonymous undergraduate, given the name ""Jackie,"" told Rolling Stone writer Sabrina Rubin Erdely she had been invited to a party thrown by Phi Kappa Psi fraternity in 2012 -- only to end up beaten and gang-raped by seven boys, who were allegedly coached along in the attack by the same student, a casual acquaintance, who had invited Jackie to the party. The horrific allegations sparked protests against the fraternity,  a police investigation, the temporary suspension of all fraternities at the school and a nationwide debate about the prevalence of sexual violence on college campuses. But the story began to unravel almost immediately when Washington Post reporter T. Rees Shapiro took a closer look, leading Rolling Stone to back away from the story and request a review by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. That review, which is considerably longer than the original article, reveals startling lapses in basic journalistic practice. Rolling Stone writer Erdely never verified the identity of the attacker and therefore never confronted him with the allegations; she never spoke to three of Jackie's friends who allegedly talked with Jackie immediately after the attack, and she never gave the fraternity a fair chance to respond, refusing to provide specific information about what happened and when. And at every step of the way, when Jackie began acting flaky -- refusing to provide basic information needed to verify her story or vanishing for weeks at a time without returning calls from the reporter -- neither Erdely nor her editors or the magazine's fact checkers made the hard but necessary decision to hit the pause button and decline to run the story. Having worked part time as a journalism professor for a decade (including one semester at Columbia), I would agree with colleagues who call Rolling Stone's lapses the kind that would be unacceptable in a freshman classroom. I've told students for years: You should never print allegations without giving people a fair chance to respond. And you should never take a source's word about important facts without verifying the truth. (There's a reason we call it reporting and not dictation.) Most of all, I tell students, remember that you're writing about human beings, who are complicated creatures: The good guys are never all that good, and the bad guys usually aren't completely bad. People can be mistaken or deceitful, I tell young reporters, they frequently forget and often lie to themselves. That doesn't make a source useless, but it must make you extra careful. Unfortunately, the early word from Rolling Stone is that they've absorbed none of these lessons. Publisher Jann Wenner has apparently decided not to fire, demote or discipline anybody at Rolling Stone, provoking expressions of disbelief among seasoned journalists. ""No one fired at Rolling Stone. Really?"" wrote CNN media critic Brian Stelter. ""What would Rolling Stone in its heyday write about an institution that screwed up unbelievably, damaged people's lives, but punished no one?"" tweeted John Bresnahan, the Capitol bureau chief of Politico. ""Rolling Stone outsources its investigation to Columbia and proceeds to do nothing in terms of individual accountability afterward? OK...,"" tweeted pundit Joe Concha. Worse still, the editors who committed the blunder seem unprepared to revamp their operation to prevent a repeat of the debacle, framing the error as an earnest but misguided attempt to believe the word of a sexual assault victim. ""Rolling Stone's senior editors are unanimous in the belief that the story's failure does not require them to change their editorial systems,"" the Columbia report says. And check out this amazing conclusion from Will Dana, the managing editor who presided over the disaster. Dana told the Columbia team: ""It's not like I think we need to overhaul our process, and I don't think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things. We just have to do what we've always done and just make sure we don't make this mistake again."" That smug attitude pretty much ensures Rolling Stone's newsroom managers will commit another goof in the future. At a minimum, they should heed the wise counsel of my friend Bill Grueskin, an executive editor at Bloomberg who formerly served as dean of academic affairs at the Columbia J-school. ""When doing big, investigative stories, reporters face many challenges: recalcitrant sources, complex numbers, buried records. Editors, whose labors are usually cloaked in anonymity, are spared most of those hurdles. But they face their own internal newsroom challenges, particularly when handling a potential blockbuster story,"" Grueskin writes. ""They must keep their star reporters happy, trim verbiage that interrupts the narrative, and deal with the expectations of bosses hungry for prizes and traffic."" The problem could be, says Grueskin, that Rolling Stone had too many chefs in the kitchen, instead of ""a single, talented editor with an intact set of vertebrae."" Until Wenner and his team learn that basic lesson -- and revamp their hiring, editing and fact-checking process accordingly -- the Rolling Stone fiasco will eventually be followed by another, one made less forgivable because we all saw it coming."
"The White House doubled down today on President Barack Obama's Earth Day message that climate change is 'a problem now' and knocked political figures who disagree with him as climate deniers and opportunists. 'The preponderance of scientific evidence is on the side of the president in making this argument. And the president believes that to deny the existence of climate change is to deny an observable fact that is substantiated by science,' press secretary Josh Earnest said today after he was asked about a Duke study that claimed the earth isn't heating up as quickly as expected. He then added, without any nudging, 'And there are some who are involved in politics that choose to deny that fact because it's inconvenient to their case and it might be inconvenient to some of their strongest political supporters.' Earnest's channeling of former Vice President Al Gore, star of the 2006 global warming documentary an Inconvenient Truth, followed the president's gas-guzzling, 1,836 mile trip on Wednesday, Earth Day, to the Florida Everglades aboard Air Force One. The White House doubled down today on President Barack Obama's Earth Day message that climate change is 'a problem now' and knocked political figures who disagree with him as climate deniers and opportunists. The president is seen here on Wednesday, Earth Day, boarding Air Force One before departing from Florida. There  he mocked opponents of climate change and said global warming is a 'problem now' There he preached about the harmful effects of global warming on the environment and the economy and mocked skeptics of man-made climate change. 'Climate change can no longer be denied,' he said. 'And action can no longer be delayed.' 'This is a not a problem for another generation. Not anymore. This is a problem now. It has serious implications for the way we live right now.' The president's spokesman did not name-check opponents of Obama's argument on climate change today but it was evident that he was referring to conservatives such as Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe. The author of the anti-global warming book, The Greatest Hoax, Inhofe, has been a vocal critic of the administration's environmental policies. In late February he brought a snowball to the upper chamber's floor and presented it as evidence that global warming is a farce. 'It's very, very cold out. Very unseasonable,' Inhofe, chairman of the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee, said and threw the snowball at the Senate president. Obama scoffed at the Republican lawmaker's antics in his Wednesday speech saying, 'yes, this winter was cold in some parts of this country, including Washington.' 'Some people in Washington helpfully used a snowball to illustrate that fact,' he noted. Taking a shot at Florida Governor Rick Scott, who allegedly banned the phrase climate change from his employees' vernacular, Obama said that 'simply refusing to say the words ""climate changed"" doesn’t mean that climate change isn’t happening.' 'If you’ve got a coming storm, you don’t stick your head in the sand,' he said. 'You prepare for the storm.' He said at another point in his remarks that climate change cannot be 'edited out' or 'omitted from the conversation.' 'There are some who are involved in politics that choose to deny' that global warming is happening 'because it's inconvenient to their case and it might be inconvenient to some of their strongest political supporters,' Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said today . Responding to the question today about the Duke study, Earnest said  'the president is demonstrating genuine leadership by challenging the country and the world to confront [global warming].' Furthermore, he said, the president is going about it in a way that will 'not just safeguard the American people,' but one that can also have 'significant benefits for our economy.' Wind and solar power, he said, do stand to yield long term benefits for the United States' economy if it makes an early investment in alternative energy sources. The president 'is determined to position' the U.S 'so that we can capitalize on those trends,' he said."

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers accepts his side cannot afford not to turn up in another big game if their top-four ambitions are to survive. Prior to the international break the Reds' 13-match unbeaten league run was ended at home to Champions League-chasing rivals Manchester United, leaving them five points adrift of the qualification places. Defeat at third-placed Arsenal would be a huge blow to their aspirations of returning to Europe's elite for a second successive season. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has urged his team to perform well in the clash with Arsenal on Saturday . Rodgers knows they must avoid a repeat of the disappointing first-half display against United which led to their defeat. 'We've made it difficult for ourselves because of our last performance and result, but it's certainly achievable,' he said of their top-four chances. 'Over the course of the last three months, apart from the last game, we've performed very well and we have got results. 'I think people might look at it (the trip to Arsenal) as a must-win game. For me, it is a must-perform game, we want to perform well and we know that when we do that we've got every chance of winning, whether that's at home or away. Rodgers watches over training as he prepares his side to face Arsenal at the Emirates on Saturday . The Liverpool boss addresses his players ahead of the pivotal clash with Arsenal in North London . 'We've had a long two weeks, it's probably one of the few games where after the international break we've had to suffer a little bit, because we didn't perform and lost, but there is extra motivation there to get something from the game and that is something that we clearly want to achieve. 'These final eight games are going to be exciting games and there is still every possibility for us to make the top four.' Many see the two sides as being similar in their approach to how they play, particularly in relation to how they like to keep the ball. That was a feature missing in the United game and it cost them dearly and Rodgers has spent a fortnight over the international break assessing where it went wrong after enjoying so much success in the previous three months. 'Our possession wasn't good enough in our last game,' he added. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard is suspended having been sent off against Manchester United . 'The key for us in the first-half against Manchester United was that we didn't keep the ball well enough and, positionally, we were never in position to receive the ball and press the ball. 'We've talked about that, we've analysed that and we've worked on that; in order for us to maximise how we've been working we need to keep the ball better and be technically better. 'That's a huge part of our game, and it's Arsenal's game. But for us, we'll go there and tactically we are very clear on the idea of the game and we need to get something from the game, that's clear. 'But that was the same before we played the Manchester United game; Arsenal was a game that we wanted to ensure that we got at least a point from and that will be the case at the weekend.' Daniel Sturridge trained on Thursday ahead of Liverpool's trip to Arsenal in the Barclays Premier League . 'We'll be going there looking forward to the game and really motivated to get back to winning again.' Liverpool have been boosted by striker Daniel Sturridge's return to training after a hip injury, while fellow England international Adam Lallana is also expected to be fit after pulling out of Roy Hodgson's squad. However, they will be missing centre-back Martin Skrtel, a virtual ever-present in the league this season, as he begins a three-match suspension alongside captain Steven Gerrard."
"The skeleton of ""Thankerton Man"" was found in a stone cist - a type of burial chamber - at Boatbridge Quarry, Thankerton, South Lanarkshire, in 1970.
It was radiocarbon-dated to between 2460BC and 2140BC and thought to have been that of a man aged 18 to 25.
The reconstructed image will go on show at the Biggar and Upper Clydesdale Museum, which opens on Tuesday.
The reconstruction was produced by specialists from Dundee University's Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification (CAHID) who worked from detailed analysis of the skull.
Caroline Erolin, lecturer in forensic and medical art at CAHID, said: ""Given its age, the skeleton of Thankerton Man was in excellent condition, which allowed us to get a strong impression of how he may have looked.
""Once we built the basic shape of his face we then looked at historical data to get a better idea of how a man would have looked at that time. For instance, we know they had the ability to shave.""
The estimated height of the man was around 1.8 metres (5ft 11ins), which is regarded as tall in Copper Age terms.
The cist contained a finely-decorated beaker which had held food or drink for the deceased's journey into the afterlife.
The pot and skeleton are curated by National Museums Scotland.
Dr Alison Sheridan, principal curator of early prehistory at National Museums Scotland, who provided archaeological advice, praised the reconstruction.
She said: ""This is a magnificent piece of work that really brings the past to light. It has spurred us on to arrange the DNA analysis of this man's remains."""
"Mons Graupius in AD 83 or 84 saw the 9th Hispana, its cohorts and Roman cavalry defeat 30,000 Caledonians.
Locations suggested in the past include Dunning in Perthshire, Carpow in Fife, Bennachie in Aberdeenshire and Culloden in the Highlands.
Historic Scotland said an accurate site was needed for inclusion on its list.
The body has commissioned research on Mons Graupius along with a number of other battle sites.
It has already placed several battlefields including Bannockburn in 1314 and Culloden in 1746 on Scotland's Inventory of Historic Battlefields and earlier this month put out 11 other sites for public consultation.
The list, which includes details on the boundaries and armies involved, will act as a guide to planning authorities.
Historic Scotland's Dr Lesley MacInnes, said a decision had still to be made on whether Mons Graupius should be put forward for consideration as an entry on the inventory.
The head of battlefields said: ""We have recently commissioned the research for a number of battlefields including Mons Graupius.
""The research will review all available evidence for these sites to establish if they meet the published criteria for inclusion in the inventory.
""Early sites such as Mons Graupius present particular challenges for accurate location which is one of the required criteria for inclusion.""
Dr MacInnes added: ""Any sites which are considered to be of national importance but cannot be accurately located cannot be included at this stage but will be kept under review should further information emerge to allow their inclusion.
""The research outcome for Mons Graupius will be clarified by the end of the financial year.""
Mons Graupius is believed to be wrapped up in the mysterious disappearance of the 9th Hispana in AD 120.
The legion, cohorts of auxiliary light infantrymen from Gaul and Batavia along with cavalry were heavily outnumbered by Caledonians at the battlefield.
However, the tactics of Roman general Gnaeus Julius Agricola left 10,000 tribesmen dead but relatively light casualties among the auxiliaries.
There has been a long running debate on where the battle was fought.
In his book Legions of Rome, historian Stephen Dando-Collins said no location has been ""reliably fixed"".
Potential sites have been weighed up on the website Roman Scotland.
It rates Dunning the most likely and Culloden among the least.
Sites close to the Grampian mountains have also been suggested in the past.
In his book, Dando-Collins connects Mons Graupius with the disappearance of the 9th after it was later posted to Carlisle.
He said Caledonians had sought revenge for the defeat and ambushed and slaughtered the legion along with its affiliated units.
Mystery surrounding the fate of the 9th inspired Rosemary Sutcliff's children's book Eagle of the Ninth and two recent films - The Eagle and Centurion.
Scenes for The Eagle starring Channing Tatum and Jamie Bell were shot around Achiltibuie and Old Dornie, near Ullapool, and in the Cairngorms for Centurion."

"Sleepy kid: Brock Guzman, 8, was last seen inside his parents silver 2001 Toyota Corolla. Authorities said the Northern California boy fell asleep in the backseat of the car and was kidnapped when the vehicle was stolen . An eight-year-old boy who took a snooze in the backseat of his family's car, apparently slept through his own kidnapping after the car was stolen from in front of his home. Brock Guzman was found safe and well about two miles away from his Northern Californian home in the abandoned car following a frantic search for him. Police said a hapless car thief likely stole the 2001 Toyota Corolla after the boy's father left it running and briefly unattended in front of his home. But the car thief clearly didn't notice the boy curled up on the backseat fast asleep as he sped away with the vehicle. The boy's father said he had placed Brock in the Corolla at around 4:45 a.m., and started the engine. He then went back into the house in Fairfield to get some belongings and his older son, who attends school 40 miles away in Napa. However, when the father went back outside, the car was gone and an unfamiliar bicycle lay nearby. In a blind panic, he hopped into another family vehicle and sped off in search of the Corolla. The boy's mother frantically called 911, and authorities issued an Amber Alert. Less than four hours later, a resident called police and said the car was parked in their neighborhood. When officers cautiously approached it at around 8:15 a.m., the suspect was gone and Brock was still asleep. He was not injured. Fairfield police Officer Kathryn McCormick said: 'We don't know for sure if he slept through the whole thing, but it looks that way. We hope that was the case.' Police do not have a description of the suspect and say it appears that the thief did not know the child was sleeping in the backseat. 'At this point, we are investigating this as a crime of opportunity,' McCormick said. Car theft: According to police, a hapless thief likely stole the 2001 Toyota, similar to the model of car pictured here, after the boy's father left it running and briefly unattended and didn't notice him inside ."
"Motherwell have vowed to go to battle with the SPFL over the issue of free entry to the Premiership play-offs for season-ticket holders. And the Fir Park side are set to win powerful backing for their revolt from Championship promotion challengers Rangers and Hibernian. Under existing rules, the SPFL are entitled to take 50 per cent of the gate proceeds from the six play-off ties for redistribution among the clubs. But a bid by the league board to force play-off finalists to charge all fans a minimum price of Â£15 for the play-off ties was withdrawn at a meeting last Thursday. Motherwell will go to battle with the SPFL over free entry to the Premiership play-offs for season-ticket holders . Motherwell general manager Alan Burrows told Sportsmail his club will make a stand if they finish 11th . Expressing unease among the play-off finalists that the SPFL might be using the ties to milk supporters, Motherwell general manager Alan Burrows told Sportsmail his club will make a stand if they finish in the Premiership play-off place. 'All our focus at Motherwell in the next four games is fully on avoiding the play-offs altogether,' said Burrows. 'We fully accept and appreciate that there are rules on this in place. 'But, in the eventuality that we are in 11th place come the play-offs, then it is not our intention to charge our season-ticket holders for the play-off final at Fir Park. 'We believe we have sold them tickets which entitle them to the full story of the season.' Rangers sources said last night that the club have yet to reach a final decision on whether to seek an SPFL exemption which would allow them to let their 25,000 season ticket holders into play-off games for free. The SPFL are entitled to take 50 per cent of the gate proceeds but Motherwell want to offer free tickets . Hibs gained a one-off dispensation to give their most loyal fans free admission to last season's home play-off clash with Hamilton. Sportsmail understands, however, that SPFL lawyers have already warned clubs that attempts to do the same this season will be strongly resisted as it would constitute a breach of league rules. Last week, a resolution by Hibs and Motherwell to have the 50-per-cent levy on play-off gates cut in half was defeated. Hibs argue their main concern is that fans are being fleeced to atone for the absence of a league sponsor . Accused of a cash grab to keep more of the play-off cash, Hibs argue their main concern is that fans are being fleeced to atone for the absence of a league sponsor for the last two seasons. Asked if he expects a fight on the matter from league chiefs, Burrows admitted: 'Based on what has gone previously, then yes.' Â ."
"A Utah couple who had been married for 74 years died five hours apart. Madelyn Yensen, 94, of Salt Lake City, died just after 4pm before her husband passed away at 9.30pm. Just after her mother died, Carol Bradford went to see her 95-year-old father at a care center and told him the news. 'I leaned over and whispered in his ear, ""Mom has passed, and she's waiting for you in heaven,""' Bradford said. 'I think after that, he knew he had accomplished what he needed, and he felt that he could let go.' Shortly after her visit on April 7, Bradford's father died of heart failure. Marcus Yensen, 95 (left), and his wife Madelyn, 94 (right), died within hours of each other earlier this month after a romance that started with a month of dating and continued through 74 years of marriage . Madelyn died after suffering a seizure when she was called over to her husband's bedside and was holding his hand, according to KSL. The traumatic attack was the last time they saw each other. 'They were always together, and they were always very happy with each other,' she said. Her father always insisted her mother should die at home with proper care, Bradford said. The two married on October 17, 1940, only a month after they met when he took a dance lesson from her at a local studio. They had lived since 1949 in a quaint, brick home where they raised their three children and adopted a calico cat named Moonpie who had shown up repeatedly at their doorstep. The couple's son, Byron Yensen, said that while it was painful to lose both parents in a single day, it was comforting to know they weren't apart from each other long. The couple live in the same brick house for more than 65 years. A funeral service for them will be held at their local church (pictured) 'It would have been very difficult for Mom or Dad to live without the other,' he told the Deseret News. 'They really loved each other.' 'He didn't want to die and leave her here. He wanted to take care of her,' he added. A joint obituary for the couple said 'Being the gentlemen he always was, and showing the eternal love they had together, Marcus held the gates of heaven open so Madelyn could walk in first, then followed her'. Marcus Yensen, who had been fighting heart problems for months before his death, was a World War II Navy veteran and Union Pacific Railroad engineer, while his wife was a homemaker. The couple renewed their vows last year on their anniversary . A funeral service will be held May 9 at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Salt Lake City."
"Sushi is a love-hate thing as a new video demonstrates. Casey Levi filmed the moment he tried to get his son Sam to eat a California roll with a $10 prize up for grabs. He stipulated that there must be no 'gagging or making any faces.' Footage shows the youngster stepping up to the challenge but  backing down after a minute's hesitation and running off 'to be sick'. Sam says at one point just looking at the sushi fills him with 'disgust'. 'It makes me want to vomit,' he exclaims later on.

"The former BBC economics editor made headlines last week after it emerged she had been ‘secretly’ dating Ed Miliband . Former BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders yesterday broke her silence over her fling with Ed Miliband, describing it as 'fleeting and very costly'. She made headlines last week after it emerged she had been ‘secretly’ dating the Labour leader when he first met his wife Justine in 2004. In a brief message on Twitter yesterday she said: ‘We “dated” fleetingly in 2004. Very costly few weeks it turns out’. It was unclear whether Miss Flanders was voicing regret over her relationship with Mr Miliband, or was embarrassed by the media coverage – or both. Miss Flanders, 46, accused the media of ‘raking over’ Mr Miliband’s past in the run-up to the election. But in fact the revelation about the timing of her relationship with the future Labour leader was revealed by Mrs Miliband during a soft-focus interview with the Labour-supporting Mirror newspaper, which was headlined ‘How I fell in love with Ed’. Mrs Miliband revealed the couple had first met at a London dinner party hosted by Miss Flanders in 2004. She recalled: ‘I thought he was good-looking and clever and seemed to be unattached. But we just went down a conversation cul-de-sac. Apparently we had nothing in common. ‘He just wanted to talk about economics – one of my least favourite subjects. None of our conversations went anywhere.’ Mrs Miliband said she had been ‘furious’ when she later found out that her future husband was not ‘unattached’ at all and was ‘secretly going out with’ the woman who had invited her to dinner. She did not name Miss Flanders. But Tony Blair’s biographer John Rentoul later revealed it was common knowledge in Labour circles that the BBC woman had hosted the dinner party. Mr Rentoul said: ‘Could the secrecy have been because he was a Treasury special adviser and Stephanie Flanders was a BBC economics journalist?’ The revelations also revived stories about Miss Flanders’s former relationship with Labour’s shadow chancellor Ed Balls, which is said to have been more serious than her fling with Mr Miliband. Miss Flanders, daughter of Michael Flanders of the musical comedy duo Flanders and Swann, met Mr Balls in 1989 at Harvard University where they were both Kennedy scholars. They later worked together as leader writers at the Financial Times. Miss Flanders, 46, accused the media of ‘raking over’ Mr Miliband’s past in the run-up to the election. Miss Flanders, now a mother of two, went on to spend years reporting on economics for the BBC, firstly on Newsnight and then as the corporation’s economics editor. In 2013 she quit the corporation to take a lucrative job as chief European market strategist for the fabulously wealthy US investment bank JP Morgan, where Tony Blair is a senior adviser. Last week’s revelations led to a series of stories about Mr Miliband’s tangled love life before he met his wife. In an interview yesterday, the Labour leader played down the controversy, saying: ‘I’m not at all bothered about attacks on me, but I don’t think it’s very nice for the other people who are not in the public eye.’ Labour sources also dismissed the row, saying it would help dispel characterisations of him as a geek. But one poll yesterday showed a sharp deterioration in Mr Miliband’s approval ratings among women. The Opinium survey showed that the Labour leader’s approval rating among women fell by nine points in a week. Just 24 per cent of women think Mr Miliband is doing a good job, compared to 45 per cent who do not, giving him a net approval rating of minus 21, compared to minus 12 the previous week. His approval rating among men is minus 15."
"Photographs taken with the very first 'secret' handheld camera will go on display on Saturday at the State Library giving Sydneysiders a rare chance to take a glimpse of what life in Sydney looked like back in the 1800’s. The Crowd Source collection holds around 150 photographs taken by Arthur Syer, a 27-year-old man living in Sydney who took advantage of the very first hand held camera, the Detective Camera. 'It was the first time people really had the opportunity to take a photograph without their subjects knowing,’ said museum curator and historian Margot Riley. The detective camera gave amateur photographers the opportunity to capture the true essence of life on Sydney streets, defining it as a ‘real revolution and turning point in photography.’ ‘The word snapshot emerged from this style of photography and the photographers were called snap shooters’ She said the detective camera gave amateur photographers the opportunity to capture the true essence of life on Sydney streets, defining it as a ‘real revolution and turning point in photography.’ ‘This was really the beginning of the mass photography you see today. It parallels with the way people look at the world now, always taking images with their phones,’ she said. ‘The word snapshot emerged from this style of photography and the photographers were called snap shooters,’ Ms Riley added. She said that this was the first time people would’ve been confronted with the idea of being photographed or observed on the streets without their knowledge,  spurring on early conversations about privacy laws. This was the first time people were confronted with the idea of being photographed without their knowledge . The camera was wrapped in a small parcel so that it didn't draw attention from the photographers subjects . 'Pesky snap shooters' were the reason people initated early talks about surveillance and privacy . ‘It definitely caused some controversy,' she said. ‘There were plenty of people being annoyed by pesky snap shooters roaming the streets, taking photos of unsuspecting people going about their business.’ The Detective Camera was produced between 1883 and 1887 using a dry negative which was already loaded into the device. It was focused and ready to take a photograph from around six feet away. The camera was loaded, focused and ready to take a photograph at around six feet away . ‘These photographs are very rare and unique because they represent the missing link between the old style tripod photography and Kodak box photography.’ It was the first time individuals who weren't trained in the science and chemistry of photography had the opportunity to dabble in the art. ‘Not long after this camera was marketed the roll film and Kodak camera box were invented. ‘These photographs are very rare and unique because they represent the missing link between the old style tripod photography and Kodak box photography.’ The photos taken with the hand held camera captured more natural gestures and poses giving us a better sense of the streets and a far more accurate view of our history . ‘You get to see some really lovely scenes of youthful anticipation' Ms Riley thinks photos taken with the hand held camera captured more natural gestures and poses giving us a better sense of the streets and a far more accurate view of our history. ‘You get to see some really lovely scenes of youthful anticipation. One of the photos shows a group of girls dressed to the nines, many with bare feet- something that was quite normal for that time.’ She said it is important to share this link to our past to ‘encourage people to build a bridge between then and now.’ The candid shots give us a better look at what life was really like for Sydneysiders in the 1880's . People from the Flickr community helped identify landmarks and other details in the photos to help locate where they were taken. This shot is on the corner of Elizabeth and King Street in Sydney's CBD . The images were collected over a period of time and were originally released on the photo hosting website Flickr. They received a 'wonderful response' from the Flickr community with some members even reaching out and helping curators identify where in Sydney the photos were taken. The Crowd Source exhibition will run from April 4 until August 23. ‘We want to share these images and encourage people to build a bridge between then and now’"
"The World Rugby Hall of Fame was launched by ex-England and British and Irish Lions captain Bill Beaumont at Rugby Art Gallery and Museum in Warwickshire.
World Cup winners Lawrence Dallaglio and Jonny Wilkinson were among 12 stars inducted in to the ""hall"".
Members of the public will be able to visit from Friday.
The World Rugby Hall of Fame was established in 2006, and absorbed the International Rugby Hall of Fame in 2014, but has previously never had a physical home.
The attraction, which honours players and administrators who have enhanced the game through exceptional achievements, features video archive of rugby matches and memorabilia.
The 10 other players inducted in the Hall of Fame were England's Jeremy Guscott and Maggie Alphonsi, Wale's Shane Williams, John Dawes and Arthur Gould, Scotland's GPS Macpherson, Ireland's Brian O'Driscoll, Japan's Daisuke Ohata, Canada's Heather Moyes and Australia's Daniel Carroll.
Players, teams, coaches, media and rugby personalities can all be considered for the hall of fame but they need to have been retired from the game for at least three years and have demonstrated rugby's ""core values"" to be eligible,
The sport of rugby is said to have been accidentally invented in 1823 after William Webb Ellis, a pupil at a public school in Rugby, caught the ball and started running forward with it."
"To commemorate St George's Day, the worlds of football and rugby have collided in a crossbar challenge between England stars of both sporting persuasions. Arsenal winger Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Chelsea defender Gary Cahill pitted themselves against  Jack Nowell of Exeter Chiefs and Bath's George Ford at England Rugby's training centre in Pennyhill Park, Bagshot. Oxlade-Chamberlain, who used to play scrum-half himself, impressed the rugby stars by taking a quick word of advice before 'nailing' his opening attempt at kicking a conversion - while Cahill seemed more concerned by wearing an oversized shirt.

"Former rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight pleaded not guilty Thursday to murder and all other charges related to a fatal hit-and-run incident in January in Compton, California. His attorney asked the court to further reduce Knight's bail, now set at $10 million, but Los Angeles County Judge Ronald Coen denied the request. The judge lowered Knight's bail earlier this month, to $10 million from $25 million, after defense lawyers called the $25 million figure excessive for the circumstances. Knight faces one count of murder for the death of Terry Carter, one count of attempted murder in the case of Cle ""Bone"" Sloan, who was maimed in the incident, and one count of hit-and-run. Knight, 49, faces up to life in prison if convicted. He is accused of running over the two men during an argument. In court testimony earlier this month, Sloan, 51, declined to identify Knight as his attacker because Sloan doesn't want to be a ""snitch"" who sends Knight to prison, according to CNN affiliates KABC and KTLA. Prosecutors offered Sloan immunity, but he still refused to testify against Knight during the preliminary hearing, the affiliates reported. The deadly incident occurred about 11 miles south of downtown Los Angeles on January 29, after a flare-up on the set of the biopic ""Straight Outta Compton,"" a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group N.W.A. At the time, Knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case. The alleged argument spilled over to the parking lot of Tam's Burgers in Compton. The hit-and-run was captured on videotape, which shows Knight inside a red truck. In the video, the truck pulls into the entrance of the Compton restaurant and is approached by Sloan, who was working security at the site. The two men appear to talk for a few moments, with Knight still in his vehicle. Suddenly, the vehicle backs up, knocking Sloan to the ground. While still in reverse, the truck moves out of range of the security camera. The vehicle is then seen zooming forward, back into camera range, running over Sloan a second time, and then running over the second man, Carter, a former rap music label owner. Carter, 55, later died. Knight's attorney Matthew Fletcher has argued that Knight was the victim and was only defending himself against Sloan, whom the defense attorney accused of possessing a gun at the time. Fletcher added that Knight's defense was to stand his ground. The incident is the latest run-in with the law for Knight, who founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991 and signed artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg (now known as Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers, and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. In August, Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards."
"The visitors were on terms at 3-3 after 20 minutes, but tries by Ben John, Sam Parry, Jeff Hassler and Dan Evans secured a bonus point by half time.
Dafydd Howells, Keelan Giles, Ma'afu Fia, Alun Wyn Jones and a penalty try took Ospreys' touchdown total to nine.
Jones and Dan Biggar made their first appearances of the season off the bench in the second half.
Fly-half Sam Davies scored 11 points and impressed with his distribution before making way for Biggar, as Ospreys made it three bonus point wins out of three this season.
They are the first team to secure maximum points from their opening three games in the history of the Pro12.
After losing narrowly to Leinster and Ulster in their opening two matches, the Italian side - who had made 15 changes to their match squad - were cruelly exposed by the Ospreys' high-tempo attacking.
And Dean Budd's last-minute try - impressive though the flanker's finish was - hardly constituted a consolation.
The only negative note for the home side was the injury suffered by Tyler Ardron. The Canada international forward who missed most of last season limped off in the sixth minute.
Ospreys revealed their attacking intent from the kick-off when man-of-the-match Josh Matavesi burst 40 yards up field.
Treviso's stubborn resistance in the face of non-stop pressure held until John juggled a pass from Davies before sidestepping over between the posts in the 23rd minute.
From that point they were not able to hold the home team, who had the luxury of bringing Wales internationals Biggar, Jones, Rhys Webb and Scott Baldwin off the bench to help drive home their superiority.
Scrum-half Webb was particularly effective, and there was an exciting cameo by 18-year-old wing Giles, who was part of the Wales under-20 team that won the 2016 Six Nations Grand Slam.
However, next week's assignment is likely to be much tougher, when Ospreys travel to face Leinster on Friday, 23 September.

"Police said the accident happened at just before 13:00 at the event in Blaxhall, north-east of Ipswich.
The air ambulance service attended and the man was pronounced dead at the scene, a police spokeswoman said.
She said there were ""not believed to be any suspicious circumstances"" surrounding the incident and a file would be prepared for the coroner.
Club secretary Lyn Berwick from Woodbridge DMCC, which is based at the Blaxhall track, confirmed it was not one of their riders who had died, but said the man had been competing at the purpose-built circuit.
At the time it was hosting the penultimate round of Eastern Centre Championship, with riders from across East Anglia.
She said members of the club were with the deceased's family but declined to comment any further."
"""We are about a third of the way down the road,"" she says.
Having been one the major players behind Manchester's recent cultural renaissance, she takes on the leadership of the Tate with palpable energy and ambition.
Her intention, she says, is to change the Tate in the next 20 years as much as her predecessor - Sir Nicholas Serota - changed it in the last two decades.
Given that he oversaw the transformation of the museum from a respected gallery in Pimlico (with a regional outlet in Liverpool) into a global mega art brand, it is a bold claim.
Sir Nicholas built his Tate empire with bricks and mortar, refurbishing existing galleries and creating new venues such as Tate Modern. Balshaw will take a different approach with her expansionist agenda, focussing more on people rather than real estate.
Roughly speaking, according to statistics collected by the newly-renamed Department of Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, around 50% of the British population visit a museum or gallery at least once a year, meaning - of course - 50% do not. These absentees are her target audience.
She says: ""We should absolutely reasonably expect 75% of the population to love the fact we have a national collection and feel happy to be visiting Tateâ€¦ and every young person should be given the opportunity to think and play and experiment in the spaces Tate holds. And that is a big, big shift.""
Her clarity of vision is impressive, but her ability to explain how it will be realised is less exact. She wants to usher in ""an easier language to talk about the joy of art"" but couldn't be specific beyond saying that arcane words should be either avoided or explained.
She talks of a radical transformation in audience profile, of a lack of representation of people from BAME background among the staff and in the sector more generally. But when it comes to the organisation she is now leading, which is to be the agent for the change she desires, she says, ""it's not that we need to change anything particularly"".
There is no doubt she is sincere in her ambitions, and probably more capable than most in the museum and gallery world when it comes to broadening the audience.
But if she is to be successful in her aims she will need to take a leaf out of Sir Nicholas's job application for the Tate director's job back in the 1980s - in which he wrote that for the institution to change he would need to grasp the nettle.

"A parody video that mocks American skiers and plays on stereotypes about US tourists has gone viral on the internet, but not all viewers are finding it amusing. The profanity-laced comedy sketch by 26 Minutes, a news satire programme broadcast by Radio Television Suisse, follows ‘Jeff Randl’, who travels to Switzerland to compete in Xtreme Verbier. With more than 300,000 views on YouTube since late March, some viewers said they were offended or didn’t find the humour in the show’s over-the-top depiction of Americans on the slopes in Switzerland. The comedy sketch follows 'Jeff Randl', who travels to 'Sweden' to compete in Xtreme Verbier . Jeff, portrayed by one of the French-language show’s presenters, is a blonde, mop-haired snowboarder who tells the camera he has travelled from Lake Forest, California to ‘Sweden’ to compete in the freeriding event. The Bible-toting and pot-smoking character plays on the usual stereotypes about US tourists – from being loud and inconsiderate to arrogant and less worldly. Scenes show Jeff smoking a ‘joint’ while travelling up the mountain on a gondola, saying ‘Excuse me, I’m American’ as he pushes his way past other skiers or snowboarders, and barrelling down the slopes without care or caution. At one point, Jeff tells the camera: ‘Sweden, I think that’s one of the 50 states of Europe or something. I don’t like it too much here, you don’t give a s*** what people are saying.’ Jeff (right) offends others by being loud, jumping queues and smoking marijuana on a gondola . He later takes offence to a rainbow-coloured gondola, saying: ‘Hey, this machine is gay. I don’t like it.’ The end of the video shows Jeff being buried in an ‘avalanche’ and pulling his Bible out of his jacket. When he is hauled out of the snow by a rescue team, he believes he is saved by God and shouts: ‘I’m American, and God bless America.’ The video has received mixed reviews on YouTube, although the majority of comments appear to be from those who found humour in the satire. The snowboarder takes offence to a rainbow-coloured gondola at the Swiss ski resort of Verbier . Of the negative reviews, one viewer wrote: ‘Kind of offended by this, definitely not entertained. Pretty poorly thought out satire.’ Another said: ‘Still trying to find the funny in this.’ Of those who found it funny, one viewer said: ‘I’m an American… and I freaking love this’. Another wrote: ‘Gotta love the Bible toting Californian surfer dude who snowboards… All it needed was for him to eat a Big Mac.’ Jeff holds his Bible after he was 'buried' in an avalanche and pulled from the snow by rescuers . Comedian Vincent Kucholl, who played the role of Jeff, told Swiss newspaper Le Matin that he has enjoyed seeing the response from Americans, and he rejected suggestions that the sketch was racist. He said: ‘It’s funny that they are reacting ... but we did nothing wrong. This was for people here, not in America.’ He told the newspaper that viewers' reactions suggests that Americans have less self-deprecating humour than the Swiss."
"The Lib Dem site was called ""May & Co"" - the same name as a Chelsea estate agent established in 1920.
The firm's boss, John Yianni, said he started getting abusive and ""weird"" phone calls when the campaign appeared on Twitter.
The Lib Dems said it was ""an innocent mistake"" and the site had been changed.
A party spokesman blamed an ""over-enthusiastic volunteer"" who had released an early version of the campaign which had not been checked.
He said the party had apologised to Mr Yianni.
The Lib Dem site is now called ""Theresa May and Co"" - but Mr Yianni said it was still close to the name of his company and he was concerned it was affecting his business.
""The damage has been done and it's probably going to get worse. You don't want to be politically biased in your business.
""People were saying: 'What are you doing getting into bed with them?'""
He said he had contacted Sir Vince Cable and the Lib Dem headquarters to ask for the campaign to be dropped.
""I was a Vince Cable supporter. I told him that,"" said Mr Yianni, who said he would not now be voting for the former business secretary.
He added: ""This company has been going since the 20s. They should have just checked before they unleashed it.
""They have changed it into something slightly different thinking it's going to be OK but it's still the same.""
Lib Dem candidate Sir Ed Davey earlier staged a protest against Conservative social care reforms, which the party has dubbed the ""dementia tax,"" with ""Theresa May & Co"" placards.
Plans to make people receiving care at home liable for the full costs if they are worth at least Â£100,000 have proved controversial since they were announced in the Conservative manifesto.
Theresa May later said proposed changes to social care funding in England would include an ""absolute limit"" on the money people will have to pay.
She has repeatedly stressed that people will not have to sell their homes while they are alive to fund care.
Speaking at the protest, Sir Ed said there are other ways of funding social care than ""setting up May & Co estate agents to come after your home""."
"Brendan Rodgers has insisted that Raheem Sterling will be going nowhere this summer and that he is 'relaxed' about the star's stalled contract talks. The Liverpool manager was reacting after the 20-year-old admitted in a television interview that he is not yet ready to sign the new £100,000-a-week contract tabled by the club, fuelling speculation that he could leave Anfield this summer. But although Rodgers admitted the interview was conducted without the club's consent and 'surprised us all', he said Sterling was still young and 'sometimes makes mistakes'. He added that Liverpool were a 'superpower' in world football and didn't have to sell their star assets before saying that Sterling just has to 'concentrate on his football'.

Sterling also shook hands with his manager as the players reconvened after the international break. And in his press briefing ahead of the Arsenal match, Rodgers said: 'The concentration a few weeks back was to purely focus on his football, and help him continue with his development at the place he’s made great strides over last couple of years. 'The last time we sat down with the player and his representatives that was the intention. 'Raheem has come out and made his feelings clear on that, and hopefully will continue to focus on his football until the end of the season. 'What he said absolutely underpins everything we’re trying to achieve here. Raheem says his ambition is to win trophies, and that’s perfectly aligned with what we’re trying to do.' Rodgers added: 'This is Liverpool, one of the great clubs of the football world. It is an honour for him to play at a club like Liverpool and he understands that. 'What he’s saying is that he’s got two-and-a-half years left; he’s quite relaxed as I am, he just wants to concentrate on football. Sterling trains alongside Brazilian Philippe Coutinho as the Liverpool team get ready for Saturday's match . 'I'm quite relaxed on it. It's part of the modern game. People who look after players have different ways of working. 'The focus is purely on the football. He has been involved with the first team for two-and-a-half years and is the player he is today is because of this environment and what we’ve created. 'He's got a lot of improvement to do and this is the best place for him to do it. 'He's not going anywhere in the summer. The focus on trying to make him the best player we can.' When asked whether money talked in situations like this, Rodgers replied: 'This club has shown that’s not the case. Liverpool is one of the superpowers of football and the owners have made it clear and we’ve seen it before that money doesn’t come into it. 'If the club doesn’t want to sell it won’t sell. That’s that case with any player, Raheem or anybody else. 'It’s about continuing to nurture a young player so he can be consistently playing at the top if his game. 'For Raheem it’s purely about the football and he’s made it clear that he’s happy here. Trying to put off all the talk. He’s a boy who loves his football. He understands and respects the opportunity that he’s had. 'Still has two-and-a-bit years left of his deal so it’s not something we’re overly concerned about. Hopefully we’ll get it sorted out.' Sterling and Emre Can leap during one of the training ground exercises on Thursday morning . Sterling takes his turn on the ladders as Liverpool prepare for Saturday's vital match against Arsenal . Rodgers did concede that the interview was carried out without the club's permission: 'There was no permission by the club, it was something that surprised us all. 'He’s a young player who has to learn and sometimes they makes mistakes. Our relationship is strong. He will learn as time goes on. We all make mistakes, especially when you’re young . England international Sterling confessed in the BBC interview that he was 'quite flattered' to be linked with Arsenal and added that he used to dream of playing abroad. Despite turning down the six-figure contract, described by Rodgers a few weeks ago as an 'incredible offer', Sterling insisted he is not a money-grabber. 'It's not about the money at all,' Sterling said. 'It's never been about money. I talk about winning trophies throughout my career. That's all I talk about. 'I don't talk about how many cars I'm going to drive, how many houses I've got. I just purely want to be the best I can be. Sterling denied he was a 'money-grabber' in the interview, saying he was only concerned about football . 'I don't want to be perceived as a money-grabbing 20-year-old.

"While pounding on the treadmill day in and day out may work for some people, for others it is a torturous task that makes exercise nearly impossible to enjoy, let alone commit to. Enter 'Retrosweat'. Founded by former NIDA graduate Shannon Dooley, 30, the aerobics classes with a twist are all about 'making fitness fabulous'. Described as 'freestyle aerobic workout,' Retrosweat is inspired by the era of old-school VHS workouts made famous by Jane Fonda, and involves choreography to match the Eighties soundtrack. Scroll down for video . Getting physical: Shannon Dooley has founded 'Retrosweat' - an Eighties-inspired aerobics class in the style of Jane Fonda's iconic workouts . Skin and pins: Typical Retrosweat attire is all about showing off your legs in skimpy Eighties leotards . Pop it like it's hot: A Retrosweat class will have you popping, squatting and grinding to a retro soundtrack . A 50-minute workout, it has 12 dance tracks and Dooley regularly mixes up the soundtrack to keep people excited each week - and on their toes. 'There's a fusion of jogging, jumping, athletic movement and dance - and a lot of huffing and puffing' says Dooley. 'Basically there's a warm up, warm down, both high and medium impact movement that targets all areas of the body. 'There will be a leg track with squats and lunges and an arm track with push ups.' Eighties alter ego: Dooley says class goers  tend to adopt a complete alter ego as their costume collection grows . Iconic: Olivia Newton-John's aerobic anthem Let's Get Physical inspired many a skimpy lycra ensemble . 'Being freestyle though, I like to change up the tracks and let people request songs, but also give people the structure of the same key moves each week.' It also promises to have you 'sweating litres, laughing loads and getting buns of steel and a core to die for.' And according to Dooley, there's nothing else like it on the market. 'What makes it different is it's theatrical - people can come into a space that’s all about the 1980s and escape 2015 for an hour,' says Dooley. 'Not to mention being physically and creatively expressive while getting exercise they need.' And it's not just for those stuck in a Eighties time warp either. Tutti Frutti - In Summer Dooley adds 'Pineapple squat challenge' a modern take on a kettlebell workout . 'The demographic is quite wide. We have girls in their early twenties that come, ladies in their thirties, ladies in their forties who used to listen to Eighties music during high school, women in early sixties who are relieved freestyle movement is back and who used to do it five times a week in the Eighties.' 'Oh and we definitely have men come along too,  they love it.' Overall Dooley says people just like to come along because they love Eighties music, want to put an amazing costume on, feel fabulous - and release endorphins - 'It’s one big healthy party!' When asked where she got her inspiration,  surprisingly it wasn't from watching her mum do Jane Fonda workouts. Diva demographic: Dooley say there's no set demographic - attendees include men and women aged from their twenties to sixties . 'No strangely. My mum was actually an amazing tap dancer so while all my friends were in aerobics classes I watched my mum do tap exams,' says Dooley. 'She is though an amazing choreographer so that’s where I get my inspiration from.' As for attire? 'I wouldn’t turn away anyone who isn’t in a leotard,' laughs Dooley. 'But as people come back, gradually each week they will start to build collection. A leotard from eBay, leg warmers from American Apparel and after a while they build this whole alter ego and when then they will come in wearing a G-string leotard and no one will even blink.' On her own wardrobe, Dooley takes her job very seriously, admitting she's never worn the same outfit twice, 'an I've been teaching for three years - so yes my lycra costumes take up a whole room now' - (65 leotards to be precise). Fit and fun: Dooley says unlike  treadmill workouts, Retrosweat is about having fun and forgetting it's fitness . 'I like to set the standards through my face, hair and body so people feel invited to be themselves,' she says. Aside from the costumes, music and theatrics, Dooley also throws in some novelty competitions and spin off Seventies and Nineties classes to mix it up for regular aerobic goers. 'In summer, we do the pineapple squat challenge - so someone in the room will hold a pineapple in the squat track (which weighs about 2kgs) and it works just like a kettlebell, except your using the resistance of pineapple. Fonda fitspo: Dooley credits Jane Fonda as one of her main sources of inspiration behind Retrosweat . 'When we do Seventies class I will mix it up with a disco ball!' Dooley says the Seventies and Nineties nights she likes to throw in for good measure and to mix up the moves, as well as give herself a break from Eighties decade for a bit. 'Nineties goes off, we dance to fresh prince and that classic song ‘Sing hallelujah!’ So with all this fun and flair, how does the fitness measure up? 'For me, other than getting people to smile, escape life for an hour and enjoy themselves, the best feedback I get is about fitness. People will say, I lost four kilos and I didn't even notice!' says Dooley. 'My class is all about the simplicity of moves': Dooley says those with two left feet won't have any difficulty . 'A lot of exercise these days is scientific, counting reps and scooping protein powder. I respect that but that’s not me. My exercise has always been jumping on my bed and having fun, and I know there is a big group out there that has brains that work the same as mine,' says Dooley. 'People want variation, they want a ballad and they want to go nuts when the chorus hits. And the great thing about using songs is they're only 3.5-4 minutes long so there’s comfort in the fact you’re jumping up and down  but there's ‘just one more chorus’ and then we’ll be done.' So for Dooley it all just boils down to getting people excited and wanting to have a 'bodacious body.' 'I love seeing people improve their quality of life through the magic of music and star jumps - as sentimental as that sounds.' As for those with two left feet, Dooley says you won't have any trouble. Baby one more time: Every now and again a Seventies or Nineties class is thrown into the mix, which Dooley says 'go off' 'My class is all about the simplicity of moves. I think it's much more enjoyable to do simple moves well and enjoy it than struggle with something complicated and not enjoy it. So whether you've never danced or are a dancer who wants to keep their skills up,  Retrosweat is all about simplicity and completely inclusive.' And it seems this 'blast from the past' class is only growing. Dooley now runs additional side business 'Dial-a-sweat' where she takes hens parties for a class, and has travelled all around Sydney from Bowral, Newport and Kirrabilli overlooking the harbour bridge. And with two current locations in Alexandria and Surry Hills that run weekly (and Bondi for a while), Dooley believes the demand is strong and she already has her eyes on even bigger things. 'I want the whole world Retrosweating, that’s the plan.' 'And if I have too much make-up on and have sweat running on my face then that’s all part of it.'"

"With the polls refusing to shift, Ed Miliband today went looking for divine inspiration in the hopes of winning the election. The self-confessed atheist Labour leader visited a Christian group in Croydon on the latest stop o his campaign trail. He bowed his head while church leaders 'put their hands forward towards Ed' as they prayed for him in Croydon. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband stopped off at Praise House Community Church in Croydon for a question and answer session with worshippers . Last year Mr Miliband described himself as a 'Jewish atheist', but all party leaders are now trying to reach religious groups in the scramble to win votes. On Friday night David Cameron addressed 45,000 Christians at an event at the Excel centre before joining 15,000 Sikhs for a Vaisakhi parade yesterday. Today Mr Miliband stopped off at Praise House Community Church in Croydon for a question and answer session with worshippers. He told the congregation that a Labour government would install an envoy for religious freedom in the Foreign Office to tackle persecution overseas. 'We must do everything we can to make sure that religious freedom is protected,' Mr Miliband said. He was bombarded with requests for selfies, as is now commonplace on the campaign trail. During the visit Mr Miliband ws bombarded with requests for selfies, as is now commonplace on the campaign trail . Last year Mr Miliband described himself as a 'Jewish atheist', but all party leaders are now trying to reach religious groups in the scramble to win votes . Mr Miliband was joined by Labour peer Baroness Lawrence, whose son Steven was murdered in 1993. Mr Miliband discussed his faith during a visit to Jerusalem. He said: 'I have a particular faith. I describe myself as a Jewish atheist. I'm Jewish by birth origin and it's a part of who I am. 'I don't believe in God, but I think faith is a really, really important thing to a lot of people. It provides nourishment for lots of people.' In a separate intervention today, the Labour leader made a direct pitch for the support of disaffected centre ground Conservatives who feared the return of Mr Cameron to No 10 could lead to rising inequality and jeopardise Britain's place in the EU. Mr Miliband was joined by Labour peer Baroness Lawrence, whose son Steven was murdered in 1993 . In an interview with The Observer he said: 'I am a politician of the left, but I am positioned where the mainstream of politics is positioned. I am on the centre ground of politics,' 'I want to reach out to Tory voters, to Liberal Democrat voters, to Ukip voters, to non-voters ... to people who feel that David Cameron can't answer the challenge of our time, who worry about our place in the European Union, who really think to themselves, 'we can do a lot better as a country'.'"
"He said his election after a landslide win in May was ""a historic moment"", and pledged no reconciliation with those who had ""committed violence"".
The retired field marshal overthrew President Mohammed Morsi last July.
He has since been pursuing a crackdown on Mr Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, which urged a boycott of the elections.
Liberal and secular activists, including the 6 April youth movement which was prominent in the 2011 revolution that ousted long-serving President Hosni Mubarak, also shunned the 26-28 May poll in protest at the curtailing of civil rights.
Mr Sisi, 59, made no mention directly of the Muslim Brotherhood in a speech at a Cairo presidential palace late on Sunday.
But he said there would be no reconciliation with anyone who had ""blood on their hands"".
He said: ""Defeating terrorism and achieving security is the top priority in our coming phase.
""There will be no acquiescence or laxity shown to those who resorted to violence.""
Mr Sisi was earlier sworn in for a four-year term at a ceremony shown live on television.
He said: ""Throughout its extended history over thousands of years, our country has never witnessed a democratic peaceful handover of power.""
Mr Sisi's victory came almost a year after he ousted Egypt's first freely elected president, Mohamed Morsi, following mass protests against his rule.
At the swearing-in, the Supreme Constitutional Court deputy head, Maher Sami, said the ousting was not a coup, and that Mr Sisi had responded to the will of the people.
Who is Egypt's new president?
Profile: Abdul Fattah al-Sisi
In the May elections, Mr Sisi secured 96.9% of the vote and his sole challenger, left-winger Hamdeen Sabahi, received only 3.1%. Turnout was less than 50%.
Mr Sisi inherits a nation that is divided and weary, the BBC's Orla Guerin in the Egyptian capital reports.
Experts warn that if he cannot deliver in the next year or two he could also face a mass revolt.
One student, Israa Youssef, told Reuters: ""Sisi has to do something in his first 100 days, people will watch closely and there might be another revolution. That's what people are like in this country.""
Mr Sisi faces an array of challenges, including fixing the economy, preventing further political crises and easing poverty.
More than a quarter of Egyptians live below the poverty line. Mr Sisi has pledged to build 26 new tourist resorts, eight new airports and 22 industrial estates.
He has promised to restore security in a country where attacks by Islamist militants have left hundreds of security personnel dead over the past 11 months.
The militants have stepped up attacks in response to the crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and its allies, in which more than 1,400 people have been killed and 16,000 detained.
Mr Morsi and other senior leaders of the Brotherhood, which has been designated a terrorist organisation, are standing trial on a series of charges. They strongly deny any wrongdoing.
Critics fear Mr Sisi will continue to show little tolerance for dissent."
"The Patriots are being investigated over allegations they under-inflated balls in beating the Indianapolis Colts to reach the showpiece event.
But, despite trailing 24-14, they rallied to become the first team in Super Bowl history to trail by double digits in the second half and win.
The Patriots took the lead with two minutes left and held on for victory.
The New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was named the most valuable player of Sunday's Super Bowl, with the 37-year-old throwing four touchdown passes, including two in the fourth quarter.
He set a new record for career Super Bowl touchdown passes with 13 to break the old mark held by his childhood idol Joe Montana. Brady's 37 completions also set a new Super Bowl record.
Pop star Katy Perry was the star attraction at the interval and she was joined by special guests Lenny Kravitz and Missy Elliott.
Perry entered the pitch on a giant golden robotic lion as she sang her hit 'Roar' before Kravitz provided some rock and Missy Elliott some hip-hop.
The climax saw Perry lifted 50 feet off the ground by a mechanical contraption and she sang 'Firework' as she floated above the pitch.
Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll was criticised for his decision to throw, rather than run the ball with powerhouse Marshawn Lynch, with his team a yard out and just seconds remaining.
""That play call will haunt Pete for the rest of his career,"" said former Cowboys receiver Terrell Owens.
""Why get cute at that point?"" ex-Green Bay Packers player Bucky Brooks commented.
However, Katy Perry received some praise. Pop star Britney Spears said: ""That half-time show! Katy Perry you rocked it."""
"The increase of 15,000 seeking work was precisely matched, according to the Office for National Statistics survey, by the fall of 15,000 in the number of Scots seeking work at some point during the spring months. One thousand more Scots were in work.
Watchers of the Scottish figures won't feel this more welcome jolt to be much of a surprise. It's been a bumpy ride in recent months, most of which have seen the Scottish employment picture worsen relative to the UK as a whole.
These most recent figures return Scotland to a better position (just) of 5.5% unemployment, while the UK is at 5.6%. The Scottish employment rate remains higher.
The unusual aspect of the UK-wide jolt is that rising unemployment has been accompanied by a sharp increase in pay. Economists don't usually expect those to go together. But these continue to be abnormal times, as the labour market adjusts towards something like normality, or perhaps a new normal.
The Scottish job statistics show that most jobs growth is in full-time work. The number of people in part-time work is growing more slowly, and fewer of them are telling ONS surveyors that it is because they can't find full-time posts.
The numbers in temporary posts have been falling. It appears that women have been the ones leaving temporary posts and going full-time, while there's also a rise in women taking a second job (more than 60,000 of them in Scotland).
The number of men in temporary roles is on the rise too, but they're much slower to get a second job.
The overall picture emerging from this reflects the strengthened bargaining position of workers, while employers accept they have to sacrifice some of the flexibility of the temporary, contractorised job market if they're to get the people and skills they need.
At 3.2% annual growth rate for June earnings, including bonuses, that's the fastest rate for five years, and with consumer price inflation back at noflation, it means a significant rise in real earnings.
It helps fuel speculation that there could be more inflation coming back into the economy, for which the Bank of England may have to consider an interest rate rise.
The pay figures bear out the view shared by trade unions and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that ""Britain deserves a pay rise"".
Not the public sector, though. It has been pegged back to no more than 1% for each of the next four years, though Holyrood could choose to vary that, if John Swinney can find the money. You can see tensions stoking up between public and private sector pay.
George Osborne's announcement of a ""national living wage"" in the Budget last week, which caught the headlines, is now catching the ire of business bosses, in some sectors at least.
The chairman of Wetherspoon's has weighed in with a warning that the higher pay creates ""considerable uncertainty"" about the future of the pub industry.
It's already suffering from very tough competition from off-licences, notably supermarkets, while drinking habits are changing unfavourably.
His reckoning is that a Â£1 pint of beer sold in an off-licence carries staff costs of about 10 pence. But a Â£3 pint sold in a bar carries staff costs of 75 pence. With his trading update, he's reporting squeezed margins.
What, then, of Scotland's growth figures? A rise of 0.6% for January to March is reasonably healthy, given other more negative indicators at the start of the year.
It is slightly ahead of the UK thanks, once again, to the figures showing construction in Scotland has been out-growing that of the UK more widely.
Construction output is up 21% compared with the start of 2014, whereas it was up only 4.5% in the UK figures.
That may be partly explained by the big projects currently under way, many of them funded by the Scottish government; the Border railway, the Forth Replacement Crossing, the M8 upgrade in Lanarkshire.
Also helping to grow the economy more than most were hospitality (in a strong year for tourism), transport equipment (such as bus-building in Falkirk) and chemicals and refined petroleum (at Grangemouth).
The sector that's been performing much less well is textiles, with output down 13% in the year to March.  The metals and machinery sector has performed poorly too.
The Scottish economy grew by 2.8% between the first quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of this year, while the UK economy grew by 2.9%.
But remember that the population is growing at different speeds, largely due to migration, and the output per head is an important measure of whether productivity is on the rise.
That growth rate per head in the year to March was 2.5% for Scotland and 2.2% for the UK. Since 2012, output per capita was up 5% in Scotland, ahead of 4.6% in the UK as a whole.
That suggests something is going relatively right. But it's relative to a poor performance. The whole of the UK needs to do more to get productivity rising, not least to make those wage rises sustainable."
"The Board of Community Health Councils (CHCs) is refusing to say why chief executive Tony Rucinski was suspended.
Emails show that before his suspension Dr Rucinski raised concerns the board's chair Mutale Merrill may have been influenced by a government minister to stop him doing media interviews.
Ms Merill said she does not accept the emails' content is ""factually correct"".
Dr Rucinski said he has been ""instructed not to comment.""
The organisation describes itself as the ""independent voice of patients"" in Wales.
It and the seven CHCs it oversees had an annual budget in 2015-16 of Â£3.8m.
Dr Rucinski was appointed as chief executive of the Board of Community Health Councils in a newly-created role in July 2015.
At the time, he told BBC Wales that he had been ""put in place to make things happen"".
He said he wanted CHCs to become a ""much more proactive and effective patient voice"".
Four months later the Welsh Government appointed Ms Merrill as the board's new chair.
Dr Rucinski was then suspended in February 2016.
Several sources have told BBC Wales that there was tension between Mr Rucinski and Ms Merrill prior to his suspension.
In emails written to Ms Merrill before his suspension, obtained by BBC Wales, Mr Rucinski raises concerns about being stopped from doing interviews on a Welsh Government digital health initiative in December 2015 and on a report by the OECD think tank comparing UK health services in February 2016.
In the emails Dr Rucinski stated that his job description involved doing media interviews and suggested he felt Ms Merill's instructions to him not to do interviews may have been influenced by a meeting with a Welsh Government minister.
He wrote: ""I am genuinely concerned about the comments you have relayed from your meeting with the minister.""
Following his suspension, a board meeting was held in which Ms Merrill appears to try to explain the disagreement over media coverage between her and the chief executive.
The minutes state that Ms Merrill said a ""media embargo"" had ""only been imposed on the chief executive regarding this one news item [the OECD story]"", and ""it was noted that there was some context behind this decision which could not be shared, however the board chair had required the chief executive to provide a briefing prior to the commenting on any issue in order to decide the best approach and deliver the message to the media"".
""A conversation regarding a need for a media protocol had been discussed with the chief executive,"" the minutes said.
The document also said that the chief executive had shared a text message from Ms Merrill with staff ""without her knowledge and without context of previous discussions"".
Following his suspension Dr Rucinski claimed in an email to the Wales Audit Office in April 2016 that Ms Merrill ""informed me verbally that the minister had instructed her to not let me do any further media engagements or public appearances"".
In that email he also said he believed ""the independent voice of patients and the public in Wales has been gagged during a crucial time for healthcare debate nationally"".
Alyson Thomas and Clare Jenkins are in ""acting chief executive"" roles.
Dr Rucinski was previously chief executive of the Macular Society from March to November 2014.
Ms Merill said: ""I can confirm on behalf of the Board of Community Health Councils in Wales that there are ongoing personnel processes relating to the chief executive officer and due process is being followed in respect of those matters.""
Ms Merill added that she did not accept that Mr Rucinski's allegations in the emails were factually correct and said she was unable to provide further comment at this stage whilst internal processes are ongoing.
Dr Ruckinski said: ""I have been instructed not to comment.""
BBC Wales understands the Welsh Government was made aware of the suspension.
A spokesman for Welsh ministers said: ""The suspension of Mr Rucinski is wholly an internal matter for the CHC Board.
""It is not appropriate for us to comment any further.""
A spokeswoman for public spending watchdog the Wales Audit Office said: ""We have received correspondence on this matter but after careful consideration we have concluded that it seems to fall outside of the remit of the auditor general, though we will naturally keep a close eye on any developments."""
"A family in far eastern Russia has adopted an orphaned bear cub which was found alone after its mother was likely killed by poachers. The Shcherbakov family has been caring for the cub, which is unable to survive on its own, since it wandered up to their house gate three weeks ago. With scenes reminiscent of the fairy tale Goldilocks and the Three Bears, the family matriarch cooks porridge for the little bear at the family’s home in Tulun, in Russia’s Irkutsk region. The Shcherbakov family adopted the bear cub after it wandered up to the gate at their home in Tulun, Russia . The family matriarch (pictured) feeds the bear porridge and milk from a refashioned beer bottle . She also feeds him milk from a refashioned beer bottle, and she told Reuters that he loves snacking on sweets. The bear, nicknamed Mishutka, may be a cute little cub right now, but he will soon grow to become a massive beast that will pose a danger to the family and become expensive to feed and shelter. The family is hoping to find a new home for the hand-reared bear and has posted adverts on the internet. They hope the publicity will encourage a circus or zoo to take him in. Wildlife experts caution against bringing an orphaned bear cub or any other wild animals into the home . The bear, nicknamed Mishutka, will soon become a massive beast that will pose a danger to the family . The family has placed adverts on the internet and are hoping the publicity will lead to a new home for the bear . While it may seem like a heartwarming tale local hunter and biologist Nikolai Tereshenko said there are few places to relocate a bear in that region, and he told Reuters that people should not adopt wild animals. He said: ‘In a home setting, when he's small, he's safe. But when he grows up, there are a lot of cases in the past, where a grown bear could even kill his caretaker. ‘To kill with one move of his paw and tear up, and do anything. So I wouldn't recommend taming a wild beast, and I have never done it myself, although I have had a lot of chances.’"

"The 23-year-old needed 6,200 points for Olympic qualification and achieved it with ease in Austria.
World silver medallist Brianne Theisen-Eaton defended her title, setting a world-leading 6,765-points total.
Latvia's Laura Ikauniece-Admidina was second, with Germany's Carolin Schafer third.
Johnson-Thompson, the 2014 champion, was second overall after setting three personal bests on a promising opening day, but fell behind on day two after failing to shine in the long jump and javelin.
The Liverpudlian recorded two legal jumps in the long jump, the furthest of which was 6.17m - the sixth best of the field and some distance below her lifetime best of 6.92m.
But while her performance in one of her favoured events diminished her chances of challenging reigning champion Theisen-Eaton for the title, it was enough to keep her on course for Olympic qualification - and a step towards eradicating the demons of last year's World Championships in Beijing.
It was the long jump, her disastrous three fouls, which ruined her chances of winning a medal last summer and the Briton had admitted she would be nervous on the runway in Austria.
When asked whether she was worried about the long jump in Rio, she replied: ""Yeah, I'm not going to lie, there will be but I know I can get through it. It's just about getting my confidence back.
""I know that I have a big jump in me. The shot put is definitely a bigger concern for me.""
This was her first major competition after undergoing a knee operation last autumn and she had repeatedly stated her main aim was to obtain the points needed for Rio, where she is expected to vie for gold with reigning Olympic champion Jessica Ennis-Hill and Theisen-Eaton.
Needing 35m or more to keep her on course for Rio, Johnson-Thompson threw 36.66m in the javelin - the second worst in the field - which left her requiring a time of 2:24.50 or better in the 800m.
With a personal best over two laps of 2:07.64 there was little to worry about, although the strapping on her left leg perhaps explained why she took it easy in the race, clocking 2:16.81 for the 11th quickest time overall.
""I didn't want to push and injure myself so I just took it as an easy day. The feeling is one of relief more than anything else,"" she said.
""My goal is definitely a gold medal still in Rio. I've got a lot to work on between now and then but this is my first time back after surgery, so I know exactly what I need to work on.""
British teenager Morgan Lake withdrew from the competition after a disappointing opening day in Austria which left her 29th overall and unlikely to achieve the total needed for Rio.
Her coach and father, Eldon Lake, revealed the 19-year-old had been suffering with an adductor injury, missing a number of weeks of training leading up to the competition.
""It was always a gamble trying to compete while managing an injury and, on this occasion, it didn't pay off,"" he told BBC Sport.
Lake, who will have other opportunities to qualify for Rio, said on Twitter: ""Disappointed doesn't come close to how I feel right now, but it has made me even more determined to get the qualifying score and fight for my place in Rio.""
The 6,200-points total is more than was needed for London 2012, while attaining that mark would require Lake to break her personal best of 6,148, set in Eugene in 2014 when she became world junior champion.
In the decathlon, Britain's Ashley Bryant fell 44 points short of the Olympic qualifying standard of 8100.
The 25-year-old, who had to borrow vaulting poles after Swiss Air had lost them, could only clear 4.40m - 30cm below his personal best.
Compatriot John Lane, competing for the first time since injury, withdrew after the first day as his poles also failed to arrive.
He tweeted: ""Some things are manageable... trying to pole vault in Austria when your poles are in Birmingham is not. Cheers @FlySWISS."""
"Fifty people were on the First Great Western rail replacement service from Oxford to Didcot when it was hit at Drayton, at 00:30 GMT.
One of the three people taken to hospital sustained serious but non life-threatening injuries, police said.
The southbound carriageway has been reopened but investigations are continuing.
The remaining passengers, who did not require hospital treatment, were taken to Abingdon police station.
Passenger Rebecca Crow posted a picture of her injuries on Twitter and wrote: ""I was on the bus, it was insane. Very thankful for no fatalities; just a bust up face!""
The bus was a replacement for the 00:05 First Great Western service from Oxford to Didcot.
Bus passenger Adam Graves said on Twitter: ""One moment the bus power failed, a minute or 2 later the lorry hit us. Bus ended up part down the embankment. #a34""
He later told BBC News: ""It sort of jumped forward. There were people screaming inside.
""Then you suddenly noticed you're falling out of your seat - everyone was flying everywhere.
""Once that initial shock had passed people were quite calm.
""A lot of people on the bus had been coming back from a gig in Oxford, that's where I'd been, that kept people calm as a few recognised each other.""
In a statement, a First Great Western spokesman said the firm was ""keen"" to offer support to all of the bus passengers and their families.
He said initial reports from its own contractor ""suggest the driver followed correct safety procedures"", but added police were investigating.
""We are offering them any assistance we can to understand the full details of the incident,"" he said.
The A34 was shut between the Botley and Milton interchanges.
It had been due to reopen at 11:00 but was delayed due to difficulties in recovering the vehicles, police said.
Officers on site were having problems earlier with drivers ignoring the closure and driving through, according to BBC Radio Oxford travel reporter Sara Dumbell.
She said diversions had also led to lengthy traffic delays in the area."
"Peter Moore (above), from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, received a letter from HM Revenue and Customs last week telling him he had died . A father-of-two has been sent a letter from the Government telling him he is dead. Peter Moore was shocked after receiving the document from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) last week. The letter was addressed to the 'representative' of Peter William John Moore and apologised for the family's 'recent bereavement'. It added that officials needed to sort out whether Mr Moore had paid enough - or too much - tax. The 47-year-old pottery factory worker, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, yesterday demanded an apology from the Government. He said: 'I don't know how that kind of mistake could have been made. 'I used to work away in the week so if that would have happened my wife could have really started to worry. ‘She opened the letter when I was out of the house. Fortunately I came back home about five minutes after she read it so she knew it was a mistake but that might not have always been the case. 'I rang the tax people and the lady on the other end said she couldn't believe it. I was just really shocked, it's just all a bit strange.' Mr Moore's wife Debbie, an accounts assistant, said she was left ‘gobsmacked’ until her husband walked through the door. The 43-year-old added: 'It's really not nice getting a letter from HMRC - especially when what they're saying hasn't really happened. I was gobsmacked. 'When I read it I thought it was a scam or some sort of joke. I showed it to Pete when he came in and he got straight on the phone to the tax office.' The letter from the Government department read: 'I am sorry to hear about your recent bereavement and recognise that this is a difficult time for you. The letter was addressed to the 'representative' of Peter William John Moore, pictured outside his home last week, and apologised for the family's 'recent bereavement'. It added that officials needed to sort out whether Mr Moore had paid enough - or too much - tax . Dear Sir/Madam, . Estate of MR PETER MOORE . I am sorry to hear of your recent bereavement and recognise that this is a difficult time for you. When someone dies, I need to work out if they paid the right amount of tax before their death. In many cases, HMRC repays tax to the estate. I need to know details of the person responsible for finalising their affairs. This person can be known as the executor, administrator or the personal representative. [...] . The personal representative may want to nominate somebody like a solicitor or an accountant to act on their behalf. If so, they can use the other side of this letter to do this. [...] . Yours faithfully, . Derek Hughes . Deputy Director, Personal Tax . 'When someone dies, I need to work out if they paid the right amount of tax before their death. In many cases, HMRC repays tax to the estate. 'I need to know details of the person responsible for finalising their affairs.'

"The 32-year old, who has won 12 caps for his country, has been signed to provide injury cover.
Ospreys tight heads Dmitri Arhip and Ma'afu Fia are currently sidelined and Rhodri Jones is in the Wales squad.
""Brian has proven quality at the top level and will add so much experience to the squad, particularly over the coming weeks,"" coach Steve Tandy said.
Mujati has played in Super Rugby with Lions and Stormers, in Top 14 in France with Racing Metro, and in England with Northampton Saints and Sale.
At Northampton Mujati was a losing Heineken Cup and Premiership finalist, and an Anglo-Welsh Cup winner.
Ospreys Head Coach, Steve Tandy, said he is expecting Mujati to make a big impact.
""This is an important signing for us given the injury situation with Dmitri and Ma'afu. Our performances this season have put us in a really strong position but we still have eight PRO12 games to go, and a Challenge Cup quarter-final in April,"" he said.
""In Rhodri Jones and Daniel Suter we have two young men who will be heavily involved but we can't go through such a big run of games with only two fit pro tight heads on our books, particularly with Rhodri still a part of the Six Nations squad and potentially away on Wales duty. It's a critical position and we felt that we had to act now."""

Referring to a woman at the check in desk, he said: 'Thank God she let me through. Man, she almost didn't let me she said the bad boy in my pants was too big to be concealed as hand luggage. I didn't even have a f***ing boner.’ O’Reilly’s TV show Dapper Laughs: On The Pull was cancelled by ITV last year after more than 60,000 people signed a petition for it to be axed.

And he admitted he had allowed himself to get 'carried away' with his own success after finding fame on social media. 'It's completely ruined everything that's going on with me as a comedian. The bad press and everything that's happened - it's wrecked my life to a certain extent,' he said.

"Supported by 89 from Steven Mullaney, Root hit two sixes and 10 fours in his 93-ball first List A century, as Notts recovered from 92-4 to reach 303-6.
Jonathan Trott hit 14 fours in his 104, his 21st limited-overs century.
But the holders fell short on 293-9 to lose by 10 runs, a third straight loss.
Warwickshire needed 49 from the last five overs as the pressure mounted, and after Rikki Clarke and Keith Barker both holed out, that became 16 needed off the last over, bowled by Luke Fletcher, but two run-outs sealed the hosts' fate.
Bears captain Ian Bell made 51, but he was the second of three victims for Mullaney, who crucially accounted for Trott, no sooner than the former England batsman had reached three figures - for the fourth time in his last 10 One-Day Cup innings.
After starting their defence of the trophy with an impressive 10-wicket win against Warwickshire, the Bears' third straight defeat now leaves them second bottom in North Group ahead of Sunday's visit of winless Lancashire.
Notts climb to fourth in the group, three points behind leaders Worcestershire, ahead of Sunday's home fixture against Leicestershire at Welbeck Colliery.
Warwickshire's Jonathan Trott told BBC WM:
""We lost our way a little bit with the bat and lost too many wickets at crucial times, including myself. I shouldn't have got out when I did.
""If I had got a few more runs, 120 or 130, it would have been a lot easier for the rest of the guys coming in.
""Mullaney and Root batted well to get them up to a defendable total but the disappointing thing is that we had chances in the game to close it out and win it and unfortunately we couldn't do it.""
Nottinghamshire batsman Billy Root told BBC Radio Nottingham:
""The century just snuck up on me really. I wasn't thinking about it. It was just a question of trying to score as many runs as possible.
""There were a lot of high-fives in the dressing-room which was nice. I haven't checked my messages yet but I am sure there will be one from Joe.
""It's nice to be selected for the start of a competition and then it's your job to try to contribute and I am happy to have done so. It's a great dressing-room to be in at the moment. Everyone is in such a good place."""
"Ed Miliband last night repeatedly refused to admit he had got it wrong over the past five years about jobs, crime and the effect of tuition fees. Labour has previously confidently predicted that the Coalition's austerity programme would see unemployment and crime soar, and the number of poor students going to university fall. But, in each case, the opposite has happened – and last night the party's leader was challenged over whether this called into question the judgment of him and his team. Scroll down for video . The Labour leader rejected a string of statistics read out by Evan Davis on how the situation in all three cases had improved – saying these facts were not what voters were talking about . Mr Miliband repeatedly refused to admit he had got it wrong over the past five years about jobs, fees and crime . Mr Miliband replied: 'I don't think that's a judgment that people are going to make at the election.' The refusal to accept that he had been proved wrong since the election came in a combative interview with Evan Davis on the BBC's Newsnight. The Labour leader rejected a string of statistics read out by Mr Davis on how the situation in all three cases had improved – saying these facts were not what voters were talking about. Mr Miliband also refused to say how much Labour would be borrowing by the end of the next Parliament, saying: 'The way you get credibility is not by picking out an arbitrary number in six years' time.' And he gave the strongest indication yet that Ed Balls would be Chancellor in a Labour-led government. Mr Davis brought up the subject of Mr Balls' comment four years ago that it was 'fantasy' to think Britain would get job growth with all the cuts being made in the public sector. He asked the Labour leader: 'What's happened to jobs over the last five years?' Mr Miliband replied: 'What Ed Balls was doing was quoting what the Office of Budget Responsibility were saying, which is there'd be a very, very big impact on public sector jobs, and there were deep questions about whether the private sector jobs could make up the shortfall.' The Newsnight presenter challenged Mr Miliband on jobs, crimes and fees - but the Labour leader refused to admit he had got it wrong on each occasion . In the interview, Mr Miliband refused to say how much Labour would be borrowing by the end of the next Parliament . When Mr Davis said he wanted to 'focus on the number of jobs', Mr Miliband had to admit: 'The number of jobs has gone up, but you know, I'm going to let people in this election make the judgment about whether that means the economy's fixed or not.' Mr Davis interjected: 'It's gone up by two million, hasn't it? About a thousand a day.' The presenter then moved on to crime; quoting shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper who said earlier this Parliament that the cuts are 'risking public safety and the fight against crime'. When asked what had happened to crime, Mr Miliband at first answered: 'Violent crime's actually up. So there are worries about violent crime. And there are big questions about what's going to happen to policing in the next parliament.' Mr Davis then asked him twice: 'What's happened to crime overall?', forcing Mr Miliband to reply: 'You're definitely right that there are a number of statistics that the Government cites to say everything's fine in the country and everything's doing well. Certain areas of crime have gone down; certain areas of crime have gone up. But let's go to the big argument of this election.' Mr Miliband gave the strongest indication yet that Ed Balls would be Chancellor in a Labour-led government . Chuka Umunna said he believed one in seven company directors should be from ethnic minority backgrounds – reflecting the population. The shadow business secretary told the London Evening Standard he would support an official target for boardroom diversity. During an LBC Radio phone-in he was asked if he would either stand as a candidate for Labour leader or London Mayor. He said he had 'no interest' in being mayor. Pressed on the leadership, he replied: 'I'm not getting into that conversation at all.' The presenter interrupted him again to point out that the crime survey of England and Wales showed it was at its lowest level since 1981. Mr Davis then moved on to the rise in tuition fees, quoting Chuka Umunna saying in 2010: 'How can these proposals do other than deter people from poor backgrounds from going to university?' Mr Miliband said: 'What I know is that there are 12 times more people from advantaged, privileged backgrounds going to university than disadvantaged backgrounds. And that isn't good enough for me and the country.' After the Labour leader declined twice to say what had actually happened to rates of enrolment from poorer students, Mr Davis told him the number had in fact increased by around a third. Mr Miliband replied: 'There are some more people going to university from different backgrounds. So the problem's fixed is it?' Asked: 'The judgment that was made was wrong?', he replied: 'No, it wasn't wrong. It isn't good enough for me that you're 12 times more likely to get to university from an advantaged compared to a disadvantaged background.' Mr Davis asked: 'So on issues about jobs, crime, social mobility, comments, predictions made by people in your team turn out to have been wrong. These are important areas. 'These are not minor quibbles are they? These are huge issues that have had a large part to play in the last five years.' ■Fuel duty would rise 'in line with inflation' under Labour, climate change spokesman Caroline Flint said yesterday. The last Labour government introduced the fuel duty escalator which saw the price of a litre of unleaded petrol rise by RPI inflation plus one pence. However, under the Coalition it was frozen for a fifth year in succession, allowing the Chancellor to boast that motorists have had '£10 off a tank with the Tories'."

"A University of Florida redshirt freshman football player faces charges after a robbery at a Gainesville apartment. Gainesville Police said Jerald Christopher 'JC' Jackson, of Immokalee, Florida, entered an acquaintance's apartment Saturday with two men. Police said the 19-year-old cornerback left the apartment, and then one of the other men allegedly pulled out a gun. Police said they took two video game consoles, marijuana and $382 from the apartment's three residents. University of Florida redshirt freshman JC Jackson, of Immokalee, Florida, was arrested on Saturday after a robbery at a Gainsville apartment . Jackson never returned, but he later called one of the victims, police said. The other two suspects allegedly made the victims get on the floor, and one victim told Gainsville Police that one of the men pressed his handgun against his face while the other suspect demanded to know where to find drugs and money, according to AL.com. Jackson, who had reportedly been to the apartment to smoke marijuana at other times, was identified, according the police report, and he  turned himself into the Alachua County Sheriff's Office. An investigation into the identities of the other suspects is ongoing. Jackson entered an acquaintance's apartment with two men, and shortly after he left the other men pulled out a handgun and demanded money and drugs, police said . The former-four-star recruit was booked into the Alachua County Jail on Sunday on a charge of robbery with a firearm. He was held on $150,000 bond . The former-four-star recruit was booked into the Alachua County Jail on Sunday on a charge of robbery with a firearm. He was held on $150,000 bond. Jail records didn't show whether he had an attorney. In a statement, Florida first-year head coach Jim McElwain said in a statement that he was aware of Jackson's actions, according to AL.com. 'We are aware of the news involving JC Jackson, and he is currently dealing with a serious issue,' he said. He added: 'We don't condone any of his actions, and it is not something that reflects on the expectations we have in the program. It is being handled accordingly due to the severity of his actions.' Jackson has been on the Florida Gators football team since last season. He was injured in the first game and took a redshirt . This is the third time since December that Jackson has made headlines for non-football-related activity. In December he was driving in his hometown with two other when someone in a passing vehicle began shooting at them. A bullet grazed Jackson during the shooting. Earlier that same month he and two fellow Florida football players, quarterback Treon Harris and cornerback Jalen Tabor were stopped for speeding on campus by university police. The University of Florida Police Department found two small bags of drugs in the car after reporting that the vehicle smelled like marijuana. Since the vehicle did not belong to any of the three athletes who were in the car at the time, none of them were charged."
"Whether he is in a car park, a factory or even a field, Ed Miliband is never far from a lectern during the election campaign. The Labour leader has been touring the country with the prop in an attempt to make him appear more statesmanlike. He has delivered key speeches in the campaign stood behind the lectern. But it has also been deployed when he is just making some brief remarks or holding question and answer events with members of the public. The Labour leader has been touring the country with the prop in an attempt to make him appear more statesmanlike - using it in a north London street on April 16 and then in Lincoln the next day . He has delivered key speeches in the campaign stood behind the lectern - including at a NHS rally in Leeds on April 23 (left). But it has also been deployed when he is just making some brief remarks or holding question and answer events - and even in the middle of a field in Nuneaton yesterday (right) Mr Miliband’s enthusiasm for speaking from behind a podium comes after his disastrous party conference speech last September when he forgot to mention the deficit while speaking without a lectern or autocue. As Mr Miliband launched Labour’s election campaign at the top of the ArcelorMittal Orbit in Olympic Park last month he spoke in front of the lectern branded with a Union Jack flag and the Labour logo. When he unveiled the party’s manifesto in Manchester he also spoke from behind the lectern. And during his audience question and answer in the first televised leaders’ debate on Channel 4 and Sky News he chose to speak from behind a lectern, while David Cameron chose instead to have a stool on stage. The lectern has also been used in some more unconventional settings though. As he spoke in the car park of an engineering factory in Loughborough the lectern was put on a small raised platform next to a puddle. When he visited the national Composites Centre in Bristol he conducted a Q&A in front of an aeroplane with the lectern. The revelation that Mr Miliband had brought in leadership coaches after Mr Miliband faced ridicule yesterday after being pictured standing at a lectern in the middle of a field in a bid to look prime ministerial. Then this week as he launched Labour campaign billboards in Nuneaton, he spoke from behind a lectern, even though he was in the middle of a cricket pitch. The constant use of the lectern is thought to be part of a strategy to make Mr Miliband look more like a man who could be prime minister. Last month it was reported that he had hired US speech coach Michael Sheehan on a £10,000 daily fee to improve his delivery and charisma. Mr Sheehan’s website includes a video where he advises politicians on how to speak at a lectern, including not holding onto the sides in what he calls a ‘death grip’. It comes as it was revealed that Mr Miliband has hired a 'leadership consultancy' firm which coaches people to look 'authentic' and cope with anxiety, it has emerged. The Labour leader, who has seen his party's lead in the polls slip with less than two weeks until the general election, has engaged the services of 'ExtendedMind' – a specialist firm offering 'performance coaching'. Labour leader Ed Miliband meets supporters at Oaktree Community Centre in Acton, west London, where he posed for pictures after speaking to local Labour Party members . Mr Miliband has hired a 'leadership consultancy' firm which coaches people to look 'authentic' and cope with anxiety . Mr Miliband's dire personal ratings have long been seen as a major electoral asset for the Tories. However in recent weeks there has been a marked upturn in his popularity - as voters get to see more of the Labour leader. A Labour spokesman today did not deny Mr Miliband had hired a consultancy firm to help his performances. He said: 'We never comment on anybody we may or may not have employed.' According to the ExtendedMind website, they provide help 'in order to build leadership skills that deliver lasting organisational change'. According to its website, the company works to help body language and breathing, and to tackle 'the anxiety we all feel to different degrees when communicating an important message to others'. They provide intensive coaching to work on body language and how to look authentic. Its website boasts how it works with 'leaders' to 'communicate their messages with greater impact' and insists that learning 'new communication techniques' does not mean someone is in-authentic. 'Any new behavior will feel inauthentic at the beginning, and will seem so to others, too. But with repeated practice we move from 'acting' to 'being'.' Ed Miliband, speaking at Chatham House in London this morning, has hired a 'leadership consultancy' firm which coaches people to look 'authentic' and cope with anxiety, it has emerged . The Labour leader, who has seen his party's lead in the polls slip with less than two weeks until the general election, has engaged the services of 'ExtendedMind' – a specialist firm offering 'performance coaching' But Conservative Michael Ellis said the revelation showed there was 'nothing authentic about Ed Miliband'. He said: 'He's had to hire someone to tell him how to act like a leader. Even after all his extensive coaching, could you imagine him standing up to Putin on the world stage? He should ask for his money back.' Mr Miliband has staked the success of his campaign on performing better then public expectations in head to head debates with David Cameron. He even hired US speech coach Michael Sheehan on a reported £10,000 daily fee to improve his delivery and charisma, it has been reported."

But Mr Cosby's lawyers said he was only one of many people who introduced the sedatives - Quaaludes - into their ""consensual sex life in the 1970s"".
They said that at no point had Mr Cosby admitted to having any non-consensual sex or giving any women drugs without their knowledge.
""Quaaludes were a highly popular recreational drug in the 1970s, labelled in slang as 'disco biscuits', and known for their capacity to increase sexual arousal,"" a statement said.
Mr Cosby's legal team is attempting to stop a judge unsealing the full set of documents from the case, including the confidential settlement agreement.
More than 12 women have accused Mr Cosby of sexual assault, but he has denied all of the claims.
2002:  Lachele Covington, a 20-year-old actress, reportedly files a police report saying she had been inappropriately touched. No further action was taken.
2005:  Andrea Constand sues Mr Cosby for sexual assault. The case is eventually settled out of court in 2006.
2014: Over the year, dozens of women make public accusations that Mr Cosby sexually assaulted them. Live shows are cancelled across the country amid protests
November 2014: TV network NBC scraps plans for a new show with the comedian following allegations by TV presenter Janice Dickinson that he had assaulted her in 1982. Repeats of the Cosby Show are also pulled from cable TV
December 2014: Judy Huth sues Mr Cosby for molesting her in 1974 when she was 15 years old. Mr Cosby counter-sues, claiming she is trying to extort money from him
May 2015: Mr Cosby speaks publicly about the allegations for the first time. ""I can't speak; I just don't want to argue; I don't talk about it,"" he told ABC News.
July 2015: Court papers made public from Constand's 2005 civil case reveal Mr Cosby admitted obtaining sedatives with the intent of giving them to women he wanted to have sex with."
"Just 8p in every £10 spent looking after dementia patients goes on research into the causes, shocking figures reveal. The outlay on stroke research is little better, with 19p allocated from each £10 spent on the health and social needs of patients. A study says the amount spent by the Government and charities studying dementia and strokes is ‘still way too low’. Just 11 per cent of research funding from he Government and charities into the UK’s leading causes of death and disability was allocated to dementia, research has found . Despite extra cash pumped into the two diseases recently by government bodies, they remain underfunded given the economic and personal impact felt by millions of sufferers and their families, say researchers. In comparison to cancer and coronary heart disease they are still poor relations, according to calculations by Oxford University academics. The amount spent on cancer research is around 13 times higher than dementia, and almost six times more than stroke. The spend on heart disease is eight times that of dementia and triple the amount spent on stroke research, says the study published in the online journal BMJ Open. Researchers assessed central government and charity research expenditure in 2012 into the UK’s leading causes of death and disability – cancer, coronary heart disease, dementia and stroke which together accounted for over half of all deaths. The combined amount of research funding allocated by the Government and charities to the four conditions came to £856million in 2012, almost two-thirds of which was allocated to cancer. Around one-fifth was devoted to coronary heart disease, while just 11 per cent was allocated to dementia and 7 per cent to stroke research. The study found a significant shift in funding since 2008, particularly after a commitment by the Coalition to new money for dementia research. But the sums allocated by charities have scarcely budged since 2008, possibly because they rely on public donations which may be affected by ‘a form of ageism’ where dementia and stroke are seen as inevitable only in the elderly. Research leader Professor Alastair Gray, of the Health Economic Research Centre at the Nuffield Department of Population Health, Oxford University, said overall research funding has not been cut but priorities had shifted. Almost two-thirds of research funding allocated by to the four conditions was allocated to cancer . Overall research spending by government bodies went up 20 per cent over the period, but there was a change in diseases that benefited. In 2012, £157million was spent on cancer research by government bodies, down from £267million in 2008. Prof Gray said: ‘There was increasing recognition that expenditure on dementia should rise and this was reflected in the Coalition agreement. ‘As a consequence less was spent on cancer because of the increasing emphasis on dementia and stroke, but these areas remain underfunded when compared with the burden of disease.’ He said research funding was ‘still way too low’ in both diseases, especially for stroke. There are at least 800,000 dementia patients and 1.2million stroke victims needing health and social care each year in the UK, compared with 2.3million cases of cancer and the same number of heart disease cases. Costs of healthcare were highest for cancer at £4.4billion and lowest for dementia at £1.4billion and stroke at £1.8billion. But social care costs of dementia outweighed social care costs of the other three conditions combined. Health and social care for dementia cost £11.6billion in 2012 – more than double the equivalent bill for cancer. This means that for every £10 of health and social care costs attributable to each condition, £1.08 in research funding was spent on cancer, 65p on coronary heart disease, 19p on stroke, and just 8p on dementia, the researchers calculated. Hilary Evans, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said the charity has more than doubled its annual commitment to research since 2008. She added: ‘It will be vital for the next government to make dementia research a priority if we are to defeat the condition.’ Dr Doug Brown, of Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘Alzheimer’s Society has pledged to spend at least £100million on dementia research over the next decade – more than ever before – but if we’re going to improve the quality of care, develop better treatments and ultimately cure dementia we need politicians to pledge continued commitment and set out an ambition to create a step change in research funding.’ Dr Dale Webb, of the Stroke Association, said that if the ‘wholly inadequate’ level of research funding into stroke remains the same, ‘we will not be ready for the challenges a growing and ageing population will bring’."
"The Greens pledged to end ""period poverty"" by providing towels and tampons to secondary school pupils and women in financial need.
A 5% tax on sanitary products has caused controversy and 320,000 people have signed a petition to abolish it.
The pledge may be funded by a tax on airship sales and aircraft repairs.
Sanitary products are not exempt from VAT, as some medical products are. Campaigns to end the tax on them have taken place in countries across the globe.
In the UK, a further row broke out in April when it was revealed some of the money raised from the tax and promised by the government to women's charities had been given to an anti-abortion group.
Of the Â£12m given to 70 UK charities, Â£250,000 had gone to Life.
Green MEP Molly Scott Cato, who has pressed in the European Parliament for a VAT exemption on tampons, towels and mooncups, said it was an ""outrage those on low incomes are forced to use socks or newspapers during their period because they can't afford a sanitary product"".
Children in secondary school from low-income backgrounds were routinely missing days at school, she said.
The Green Party said it wanted to work with health companies to provide the free products.
It will look at funding them by taxing other products and services such as air craft repairs and maintenance and airship sales."
"She may not look it, but this 72-year-old is a master con artist. Cathryn Parker has lived under at least 74 aliases in Los Angeles, mainly those of Hollywood production workers. But after 15 blissful years skipping over legal hurdles, it all came to a grinding halt when she was stopped for a traffic violation. Police started to investigate Parker after realizing she gave the traffic officers a false name. Tracking down her house, they found she was leasing under another false name. The case quickly unraveled into one of the biggest cases of identity theft the state has ever seen. Master con? Cathryn Parker, 72, has been living as 74 different people, mainly Hollywood production staffers . 'I've been a cop for 20 years... and this is the first case where I've had this many aliases,' LAPD's Detective Danny Gore told the LA Times. He predicted Parker would have continued to operate under the various identities for the rest of her life. 'It's like a way of life. I don't know that there was an end,' he remarked. 'You have to be dedicated.' Efforts to find a phone number for Parker were unsuccessful. It wasn't immediately known if she has an attorney. As of Friday, Parker was in federal custody in Northern California, where she was wanted for probation violations. She was convicted in 2000 for federal mail fraud in Hawaii after she used the Jenny Craig Corp's corporate travel account to purchase plane tickets and then sold the tickets privately for $500 apiece. Parker has repeatedly violated the terms of her release since then and was wanted by the U.S. Marshals, according to records. According to police, she also paid utilities under false names and acquired credit cards with other people's financial information. After she serves time in Northern California, she'll be sent down to Los Angeles County to answer for the alleged identity thefts, Deputy U.S. Marshal Laura Vega said. Until that time, investigators are looking for more victims. Though the current victims only date back to 2012, Gore said he believes there could be incidents going back to 2010. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."
"A federal grand jury has charged millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst, a convicted felon, with unlawful possession of a firearm. In this week's indictment,  Durst, 71, is accused of possessing a .38 caliber revolver, which authorities allegedly found in his hotel room last month. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if found guilty of that charge, according to the indictment. The charge is the latest in a litany of accusations. A Louisiana judge ruled last month that Durst, who is charged with first-degree murder, will be held without bail at a facility near New Orleans. Durst was featured this spring in ""The Jinx,"" a HBO documentary about him. He's accused of killing his friend  Susan Berman at her home in California in 2000. He also faces state weapons and drugs charges in New Orleans. Last month, court documents claimed that Durst had a loaded .38-caliber revolver, marijuana, his passport and birth certificate, a latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair attached and more than $40,000 cash. He also had a UPS tracking number. The package was intercepted by the FBI, prosecutors said, and it contained clothing and more than $100,000 in cash. But the bigger courtroom fight will probably unfold in Los Angeles, where the district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against Durst last month. He awaits extradition to Los Angeles to face that charge. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Durst of ""lying in wait"" and killing Berman, a crime writer and his longtime confidante, because she ""was a witness to a crime."" Berman was shot in the head in her Beverly Hills home in December 2000, shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst. Durst has long maintained that he had nothing to do with Berman's death or his wife's disappearance. It's not the first time he has been accused of murder. He admitted killing and dismembering his neighbor at a 2003 trial, but he was acquitted after arguing that he acted in self-defense. FBI agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Unsolved cases in Vermont, upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California are among those getting a new look, the official said. Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said it's a sign that authorities are desperate. DeGuerin has said Durst has serious medical conditions. He is suffering from hydrocephalus, which required brain surgery a couple of years ago, DeGuerin said. Doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head, the attorney said. ""At the same time he was in the hospital, he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer. So he's got some serious health issues. ... He's lost a lot of weight. He's not in good health,"" DeGuerin said. DeGuerin also said that Durst is ""mildly autistic"" and has received treatment in the past from one of the country's leading experts in Asperger's syndrome and autism."
"Patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million GP appointments last year, shocking new figures have revealed. A study reported in the British Medical Journal found that 90 per cent of patients were able to get an appointment in 2013/14. The 10 per cent who could not amounts to around 33.8 million unsuccessful attempts each year - or 81 per surgery each week. The shambolic situation is responsible for as many as a quarter of A&E visits, the researchers say. Lack of access: Patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million GP appointments last year . The figures, from the GP Patient Survey, also show that patients who report worse access to conventional GP appointments are more likely to use out-of-hours   services. And surgeries where patients were able to see a GP within two week days had lower rates of A&E department visits. Other research has suggested that greater access to GP surgeries is linked with lower rates of emergency admissions for conditions such as heart failure and stroke. The figures come just a day after it was revealed one in five visits to A&E are unnecessary. A fifth of patients turning up in A&E have self-treatable conditions including sore throats, athlete’s foot and head lice, a study has claimed. Researchers have calculated that more than 4 million visits a year are unnecessary – costing the NHS £290 million. Doctors have even reported patients showing up because they were hungover, their false nails were hurting or they had paint in their hair. The analysis of data from 15 A&E units by consultancy firm IMS Health found that 19 per cent of patients had what is called a ‘self-treatable condition’. The data covered one in ten A&E units across England, so if the trends are mirrored across the country, then an estimated 4.1million of the 21.7million visits last year were for minor ailments. The problem is largely caused by the fact that patients find it difficult to see a GP, particularly out of hours. Many go to A&E in the knowledge that they will at least be seen by a doctor that day, even if they have to wait four hours. Today's piece, written by academics from Imperial College London and New York University, points out that more GPs are required if access is to be improved. But they add politicians' promises of an extra 5,000 to 8,000 GPs are likely to be challenging to achieve. Effect: The situation is responsible for as many as a quarter of A&E visits, the researchers say. The new figures come just a day after it was revealed a fifth of patients turning up to casualty have self-treatable conditions including sore throats, athlete’s foot and head lice . So despite election pledges by the Tories and Labour to improve access to GPs appointments, they argue these promises are unlikely to be achieved within a parliamentary term. The 'public should [therefore] question the promises of politicians', they said. The BMJ report said largest increase in GPs over a previous parliamentary term in the past 20 years was 5,414 GPs (from 2004/05 to 2008/09) under Labour. But Labour's previous pledge for all appointments within 48 hours was 'far from being achieved', it adds. Only 81 per cent of patients ended up able to see a GP within two weekdays in 2009/10 when the party was last in government. The researchers add there is also no firm proof that more patients getting to see their doctor will lead to fewer A&E attendances. David Cameron has promised patients will be able to access GP surgeries between 8am and 8pm seven days a week by 2020 if the Tories are re-elected. Ed Miliband has guaranteed appointments within 48 hours if Labour are voted in. But the piece said these pledges may prove unrealistic, adding that the evidence behind them has not been made clear - and the problem with access has not been precisely defined. Denial: The study authors say that despite election pledges by the Tories and Labour (David Cameron and Ed Miliband are pictured, left to right) to improve access to GPs appointments, these promises are unlikely to be achieved within a parliamentary term . 'The aims and rationale of the policies outlined by the Conservative and Labour parties do not seem explicit,' the analysis said. 'One aim is undoubtedly to win election votes. But the aims for the NHS and for patients are less clear.' The analysis suggests five points of action 'for policy and research if improvements in access are pursued'. These are: . * Evaluating the extended opening hours pilot scheme carried out by the Tories . * Making general practice consultation data routinely available . * Looking at employing practice staff besides GPs . * Evaluating new types of appointment such as telephone consultations . * Considering alternatives to general practice such as pharmacist-led minor illness services. Lead author Thomas Cowling, of Imperial College London, said: 'Both parties have made bold promises about access to GP services, but the evidence behind their pledges is lacking. 'It's important that policies like extended access are independently evaluated before being implemented more widely. 'The pledges on increases to the GP workforce are very ambitious and unlikely to be met within a parliamentary term.' Instead, he recommended the NHS evaluates the use of new types of appointment that have been proposed to increase GP capacity, such as consultations and triage by phone or online. 'It should also consider other types of staff who could take on some of the work of GPs.'"
"Jamie Carragher believes Chelsea captain John Terry is the best defender to have ever graced the Premier League. Terry, 34, has enjoyed another impressive season at Stamford Bridge and was the star performer as he led Jose Mourinho's side to a 0-0 draw against Arsenal on Sunday. The draw at the Emirates means Chelsea now need just six points from five games to claim their first Premier League title since 2010. John Terry celebrates after the Premier League match between Arsenal and Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium . Jamie Carragher believes the Chelsea captain is the best defender to have played in the Premier League . Carragher insists Terry deserves much of the credit, saying on Sky Sports: 'There’s no doubt that, just behind (Eden) Hazard in this Chelsea team, Terry has been the most influential. 'We’ve seen (Cesc) Fabregas, (Nemanja) Matic and Diego Costa feature in the early part of the season, but if you look at Terry’s display (against Arsenal) he was outstanding. 'We talk about Chelsea being a defensive team, but sometimes you’ve got to say they defend brilliantly, and Terry is the best. Carragher (left) claimed Terry has been almost as influential as Chelsea's star man Eden Hazard . 'There have been a lot of great centre-backs in Premier League history, but I think he has been the best that we’ve seen.' Blues boss Mourinho was also quick to praise his captain after Sunday's draw and even claimed it was Terry's best performance in a Chelsea shirt. Mourinho said: 'I told John Terry in the dressing room that he made fantastic performances with me in six years but for me this was the best I have seen from him. 'It was the best JT has ever played. His defensive performance was absolutely amazing.' Terry looks to get the better of Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud during the 0-0 draw in north London . Blues boss Jose Mourinho hailed Terry's performance against Arsenal as the 'best' he has seen ."
"Birmingham academies Park View and Nansen Primary - rated inadequate by Ofsted - will have their funding agreements terminated.
Park View Educational Trust said it may be removed from running the schools.
Oldknow Academy and Golden Hillock School, also rated inadequate, were warned they could lose funding unless concerns were addressed.
A head teacher at one of the Trojan Horse schools said parents tried to undermine her authority and descended on the school during an Ofsted inspection.
The head teacher, who wished to remain anonymous, said she heard parents speaking to an inspector about her.
She said she came close to quitting her job on a number of occasions but everything ""fell into place"" when news of the Trojan Horse letter broke.
""From 2012 I felt alone,"" she said.
""I did not know it was happening to other heads. If I had known, I could have rationalised it but at the time I felt embarrassed.
""I started thinking 'maybe it is me, maybe I'm doing something wrong.'""
On Monday, the watchdog published 21 reports into schools allegedly targeted as part of a hardline Muslim takeover.
Five of those schools, including Park View and Oldknow, were rated inadequate.
'Islamic-themed assemblies'
Birmingham City Council said it would work with Saltley School, the only local authority school placed in special measures, and the Department for Education to install a temporary governing board.
In a letter to Park View chairman Tahir Alam, education minister Lord Nash said there were ""deep concerns"" about the way Park View School was run.
The letter said: ""I have decided under clause 5.6 of the supplementary funding agreement for the academy to give written notice of the Secretary of State's intention to terminate that agreement.""
Lord Nash criticised the trust for failing to promote ""spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils"".
""I am deeply mindful of the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations,"" he said.
A similar letter about Nansen Primary School, also addressed to Tahir Alam, said it would have its funding arrangement terminated.
Both letters invited the trust to respond before 4 July.
A spokesman for Park View School said they would challenge the Ofsted report through the appropriate legal channels.
They said terminating the funding agreement would mean the trust could be removed from the running of the three schools.
""What happens to the schools after that would be the decision of the secretary of state, as they are already academy schools under the remit of [the] Department for Education,"" they said.
In a letter to Dr Achmad da Costa, chair of Oldknow Academy Trust, Lord Nash said it was not meeting the requirements set out in its funding agreement.
""Therefore the Secretary of State is minded to terminate the funding agreement unless all the breaches are addressed promptly, in full, and to his satisfaction,"" it said.
Lord Nash set out a list of actions the trust must take before 4 July.
These included ending ""less favourable"" treatment of non-Muslims, ceasing segregation of boys and girls, and drawing up a plan to ensure a more ""broad and balanced"" curriculum.
Oldknow Academy declined to comment on the letter from Lord Nash.
A letter to Tahir Alam regarding Golden Hillock's funding arrangement set out a similar list of demands to be completed within the same timescale.
Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw said ""a culture of fear and intimidation has taken grip"" in Birmingham schools, while a number of head teachers had reported an ""organised campaign to target certain schools in order to impose a narrow, faith-based ideology"".
'Own agendas'
The report into Park View School said the academy's work to keep students safe, including from extremism, was inadequate.
It said external speakers had not been vetted properly and the school had allowed a guest with known extremist views to speak to students as part of Islamic-themed assemblies.
Park View and Oldknow trusts did not comment on the future but one of Saltley School's senior teachers said it hoped to boost its Ofsted rating.
Darren Turner was brought in as associate head teacher on Thursday as part of a partnership scheme with other local schools.
He said there had been ""upset"" among staff and pupils at Saltley's inadequate rating.
""This is all about moving forward, what happens next,"" he said.
""Behind these walls they've got some excellent teachers and they want to get back to doing what they are good at: teaching.
""When this school gets back to 'good' again we want to go further and become outstanding.""
Parents at the schools have criticised Ofsted's reports and accused inspectors of bias.
Health professional Arshad Malik told the BBC the findings were  ""alien"" to his child's experience at Park View.
""â€ŽInspectors came with loaded questions,"" he said.
""People are trying to use this school to push their own agendas.""
He said parents would like to invite Education Secretary Michael Gove to the school for an open meeting about Ofsted's findings and to talk about what evidence was found to support them."
"Cellphone footage appears to show a Minneapolis police officer threatening to break the legs of a teenager who claims he was pulled over because of racial profiling. The March 18 video recorded by Faysal Mohamed lasts for 30 seconds and begins with a police officer giving a violent warning while his gun was trained on the teen and his two friends. 'Plain and simple, if you f*** with me I'm going to break your leg before you even get a chance to run. Be honest. I don't screw around,' says the officer. Keeping calm, Mohamed's friend replies to the officer without missing a beat to say, 'Who said I was going to run?' Scroll down for video . Pulled over: The teens were cuffed and held on the side of the road by the officers in south Minneapolis on March 18 . Filmed: Faysal Mohamed (picture) was in the car when the officer threatened violence against the three teenagers . Put on the backfoot, the unidentified officer justifies his aggressive tone saying, 'I'm just giving you a heads up. I'm trying to be Officer Friendly right now.' According to Mohamed he and friends had just left the YMCa in south Minneapolis when the police officer pulled over their car. They were told to get out and put into handcuffs and when they asked why, the police officer said, 'Because I feel like arresting you'. Mohamed told a CBS News report that they were held for 45 minutes while they were searched and a background check completed on them. Frightened: Liban Yusuf (left), Faysal Mohamed (center) and Hamza Jailani (right) have made an official complaint to the Minneapolis Police Department . The officers claimed they were being investigated for grand theft auto, but were let go. Liban Yusuf, 18, who wa with Mohamed said the officers frightened him. 'They had their guns drawn,' said Liban to Fox News. 'I don't know why they were so aggressive.' Former police officer, Mylan Masson, who teaches law enforcement at Hennepin Technical College in Minneapolis, says what the officers did appeared wrong. 'It's a threat … it's an illegal, you know, you can't threaten people. And the other thing is you can't break legs. It's not part of the Constitution and it's not part of the laws that we have,' Masson said to CBS News. According to Fox News, the officer who made the threats is called Rod Webber and Minneapolis police confirmed an investigation is underway."
"One ex-manager said he was instructed to offer free bets and drinks - in one case it was suggested he could buy lunch for high-spending customers.
Other managers we spoke to said they were paid a bonus if they met financial targets on the machines.
The industry says it takes responsible gambling very seriously.
Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBT) offer simple touch screen play, usually on a version of roulette, where people can gamble as much as £100 per spin, in theory every 20 seconds.
""John"", who was a manager at Coral until recently, said staff were given instructions to offer machine players refreshments as soon as they entered the shop and do ""absolutely anything"" to make them feel comfortable.
""If the shop was too hot for them, we would have to turn the heating down or vice versa. They were the gods of the betting shop,"" he said.
""There was a suggestion from the area manager at one time that if we had a customer coming in their lunch hour, we had to make sure they didn't waste time trying to get a cheese and ham roll instead of playing the machines. You could go out there, buy them a cheese and ham roll and get it ready for them.""
Coral said it takes its commitments to responsible gambling ""extremely seriously"". It added it had ""strengthened protections for all its customers, providing help and support for the very small minority that may have issues with their gambling activity"".
John said managers had to hit their machine profit target and would receive a financial reward if they did.
""I know another firm based their whole wage on how much money they made on machines, so there was every incentive for the staff to encourage people,"" he said.
The two store managers, who still work for Coral, said they felt pressure to hit financial targets on the FOBTs machines.
One passed on internal emails from Coral's central operations department about a new FOBTs game called Big Banker, which gave advice on ""smashing your targets"".
It said: ""Ensure your team has… identified your target key customers to demonstrate our popular feature game. Offer a demo to all of your machine customers to whet their appetite, then encourage them to play with their own money.
""Once you have identified your target customers, it often helps when you use a 'hook' to encourage them to play. 'You like Big Banker, do you have our bonus card yet? It's quick, it's easy and it's free.'""
Case study: 'Red mist' of gambling
Tony Franklin has had a problem with gambling since he was a child. He had managed to stay out of the bookies for a year, but over a couple of hours 18 months ago, he blew it all.
Having avoided high-street bookmakers for a year, he cleaned out his bank account in just an hour after a trip to the barbers.  As he left he was drawn to one of the many betting shops on his high street and one of its FOBTs.
""I was totally devastated and just completely caught up in the gambling, in the red mist of it,"" he says.
His addiction has had a devastating effect on his personal relationships.  He had been due to bring his wife and child over to the UK to set up home but his expensive relapse put his plans on indefinite hold.
Now Tony keeps his betting shop receipts from that day as a reminder of how quickly he can lose control when faced with temptation. He feels the industry should be doing more to stop addicts like him losing control.
Under the industry's code of conduct, all staff should be trained to identify and help problem gamblers.
But one woman, who works for another unnamed bookmakers, said that did not always happen.
""I have never actually been trained. All we have is a leaflet and are told to give them out if we feel people have a problem. But working on your own at night, or even in the morning, makes it extremely hard to hand out leaflets and speak to customers who are clearly frustrated,"" she said.
Malcolm George, from the Association of British Bookmakers, said: ""It is absolutely the case that anyone joining and working in a betting shop will receive training about problem gambling.""
Coral said it rejected the allegations made by the BBC.
It added in its statement: ""Recent health surveys show that problem gambling rates have in fact fallen since the introduction of FOBTs and the average Coral customer's loss per session on a FOBT is around £6-9.
""The introduction of supervised stakes above £50 from April last year has had a profound change in customer behaviour, with an approximate 70% reduction in stakes above that level.
""Training, tools and processes are in place throughout the business to ensure that potential problem gamblers are identified and protected.""

McIlroy, 28, suffered a recurrence of a rib injury at the Players Championship.
However, he said on Tuesday there would be ""no limitations"" on his swing when he opens up at Erin Hills on Thursday.
""I'm totally fine to play. It's just a matter of limiting my practice,"" said the world number two, who confirmed he will play in the Scottish Open in July.
The rib stress fracture, which McIlroy suffered in the close season, flared up as he lost a play-off to Graeme Storm at the South Africa Open in January.
McIlroy was ruled out for a number of tournaments in January and February but after returning to action, he felt the injury again at the Players Championship.
The Northern Irishman was forced to pull out of the PGA Championship at Wentworth and also missed the Memorial Tournament in America, which meant he has had no warm-up events in advance of the season's second major.
However, the 2011 US Open champion was upbeat on Tuesday as he spoke of his preparations for the event in Wisconsin.
""I don't feel like I need a run of events to get back into it,"" added McIlroy, who will play in the Scottish Open at Dundonald in order to fine tune his links preparation for the following week's Open Championship.
""Preparation-wise, instead of hitting five bags of balls I'll hit two. If you hit 100 drivers a day and you swing at 120mph, it's going to take its toll a little bit. So it's just a matter of managing that.""
The long-hitting McIlroy added that he wasn't upset to see the rain falling heavily on Tuesday on the already lengthy 7,693-yard course.
""I wasn't crying when I saw that rain this morning. That's a long golf course that's only going to play longer,"" continued the four-time major winner, who is using a new putter this week."

Keeping Up with the Kardashians' star Jenner, formerly known as Bruce, is at number seven.
She revealed her transition to Caitlyn on the cover of Vanity Fair last month.
The former Olympian, whose famous children include step-daughter Kim Kardashian and daughter Kendall Jenner, is honoured for bringing the experience of being a trans woman to a global audience.
Both the Vanity Fair photoshoot and the ensuing #CallMeCaitlyn hashtag adopted by many fans on Twitter generated huge publicity.
Actress, director and humanitarian campaigner Jolie made number three on the list, which was revealed on BBC Radio 4, for ""using her celebrity to impressive ends"" and the ""Angelina-effect"".
The term was coined after the actress revealed her genetic predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer, sparking other women to seek out testing.
Jolie has spoken openly about her double mastectomy and having her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed to prevent cancer.
The Guardian's first female editor Katherine Viner was at number four on the list, just weeks after taking up the job, while Wintour, editor-in-chief of American Vogue, was at number two.
Whistles chief executive Jane Shepherdson, who was on the judging panel, said the editor ""influences the world in what to wear, how to look, and who to celebrate.
""Like the captain of almost any other industry, Wintour's word is almost law.""
The list was counted down during a special Woman's Hour show from the BBC Radio Theatre, hosted by presenters Jane Garvey and Jenni Murray.
The panel of judges, headed up by journalist and broadcaster Emma Barnett and including human rights lawyer Helena Kennedy QC and Radio 1 DJ Gemma Cairney, looked at well-known women's personal ability to influence others.
Sturgeon is at number one following the Scottish National Party's performance in this year's general election, winning 56 our of 59 possible seats in Scotland.
Though she didn't stand as a candidate, the judges called Sturgeon ""the woman of the moment in terms of influence and hard power"".
Singer, songwriter and music video director Sia made number six, having written for Beyonce, Rihanna, Jessie J and Katy Perry and achieving solo success with hits like Chandelier.
""It is a secret to most how much of a part of the pop music eco-system Sia actually is,"" said Cairney, adding, ""all the while remaining faceless in an industry so much based on, well, face.""
Woman's Hour Power List 2015 - Top 10 influencers
1. Nicola Sturgeon - leader of the SNP
2. Anna Wintour - editor-in-chief of American Vogue
3. Angelina Jolie - actor, director and humanitarian ambassador
4. Katharine Viner - editor of The Guardian
5. Camilla Cavendish - director of Downing Street Policy Unit
6. Sia - singer, songwriter and music video director
7. Caitlyn Jenner - high profile trans woman
8. Karen Blackett, CEO, MediaCom UK
9. Zanny Minton Beddoes - editor-in-chief of The Economist
10. Sara Khan - co-founder of Inspire
Speaking about Jenner's inclusion in this year's top 10, Daily Mail columnist and judge Sarah Vine acknowledged it was controversial, for several reasons.
""Initially... many of us felt that Kim Kardashian would have to appear somewhere - not because any of us felt any particular admiration for the woman, but simply because her influence on millions of women worldwide is undeniable.
""But then the Caitlyn Jenner story broke and I in particular felt that she trumped all others in the celebrity stakes.""
She added: ""I understand why someone like Jenner might make people feel uncomfortable; but she is a human being like the rest of us and should not be denied the same rights - or indeed respect - as those who live more conventional lives.
""As to her influence, it can only be to the good if a wider audience can learn to understand her experience.""
Last year's Woman's Hour Power List, entitled Game Changers, was topped by Doreen Lawrence, while the Queen topped the first list in 2013.
Woman's Hour editor Alice Feinstein added: ""The way power operates in today's global, interconnected society is not straightforward - brokers of hard power like prime ministers, presidents and CEOs are no longer calling all the shots.
""What I wanted to examine in this year's list of influencers is how women are operating outside traditional power structures to get things done."""

"Supermarket Morrisons cut the price of diesel by up to 2p per litre, and Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's followed the move with their own price cuts.
The last time diesel was cheaper than petrol was 2001, according to analysis by Experian Catalyst.
Morrisons said lower wholesale diesel costs meant it could pass on savings.
Mark Todd, petrol director for Morrisons, said: ""This is a milestone in motoring and many younger drivers won't remember the last time that diesel prices were lower than unleaded.""
Pump prices are influenced by factors including the distance from oil terminals and refineries, so not all diesel prices will be lower than petrol, the supermarkets said.
In July 2001, diesel cost 77.92 pence per litre on average, compared with 77.94 pence for a litre of petrol, according to Experian Catalyst data. A month prior, diesel had been as much as a penny cheaper per litre, and a price difference of just under two pence was found in 2000.
There may be some delay until UK motorists see the price dip among all competitors. Experian Catalyst said the on Sunday UK average prices narrowed to 117.10 pence per litre for petrol and 118.33 pence for diesel.
Diesel is normally more expensive than petrol per litre for a variety of reasons, according to the United Kingdom Petroleum Industry Association.
While most recent investment in refineries UK has been for unleaded petrol production, more efficient engines mean petrol demand has been decreasing since the early 1990s, depressing prices by comparison to diesel, it says.
However, increased supply of diesel from refineries outside the UK is likely to be the reason behind this recent price flip, according to the RAC.
""With the price of crude oil standing at $56.50 and the pound relatively strong against the US dollar - the fuel trading currency - there is scope for further price cuts of up to 4p per litre off diesel over the next fortnight, and unleaded may even benefit from a slight reduction too due to the continued oversupply of oil,"" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams.
""Drivers of unleaded petrol vehicles should not feel short changed - what we are seeing is the diesel pump price coming down to a level closer to what it should be due to the effects of greater refining capacity in the Middle East.""
Wholesale prices for diesel have been cheaper than petrol since 27 May, the RAC said.
As crude oil has become cheaper, both petrol and diesel prices have fallen too. However, petrol prices have fallen more slowly allowing diesel to become cheaper, says James Challinor, research director for research and consultancy group Wood Mackenzie. This is caused in part by demand for petrol from the US.
""Fundamentally it is strong demand for European gasoline [petrol] from the US and West Africa that is supporting the wholesale"" petrol price, he said.
Refinery outages in Latin America are creating demand for exports of US petrol into that region, which in turn leads European petrol to be exported to the US, he added."
"The study's lead researcher said the results are a 'surprise', but  it's no excuse to pile on the pounds . For years we have been told that the first step to staying healthy is to keep to a healthy weight - that means making sure your Body Mass Index (BMI) is within the normal range of 18 to 24. Few people are advised to gain weight, unless their BMI is below 18, but could that change? A study published last week suggests that overweight people are less likely to develop dementia. The researchers, drawn mostly from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, analysed the medical records of nearly two million people for up to ten years and found that those who were overweight (with a BMI of 25 to 29) had an 18 per cent lower risk of dementia compared to those with a healthy BMI. Remarkably the obese (with a BMI of 30 plus) did even better; they were 24 per cent less likely to develop dementia. Being underweight increased the dementia risk by 39 per cent. Dr Nawab Qizilbash, a clinical epidemiologist and the lead researcher, called the results a 'surprise', but said it was no excuse to pile on the pounds: 'This is a robust and reliable study that opens up an avenue in the search for factors that protect against Alzheimer's.' But these results are not that extraordinary. Three years ago, an even larger study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reported that overweight people tended to live longer than those of normal weight. The study analysed 100 trials involving three million people. It found that being overweight (a BMI between 25 and 29) reduced the risk of premature death by six per cent compared with someone of a normal BMI. More surprising was that even if someone was at the lower end of obese (BMI of 30 to 34.5) their risk of premature death didn't go up. Being obese started to reduce lifespan only when your BMI went above 35 - here the risk of dying earlier climbed to 29 per cent greater than those with a normal BMI, according to the study, headed by Dr Katherine Flegal, of the U.S. government Centres for Disease Control. So could being cuddly fat, rather than hugely overweight, protect you against dying early? Being overweight (a BMI between 25 and 29) reduced the risk of premature death by six per cent . Professor David Haslam, a GP and chairman of the National Obesity Forum, says something called the obesity paradox is at work: 'Obesity increases your chances of developing disorders such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes but once you've fallen ill, being a bit overweight seems to have a protective effect. 'The obesity paradox had been called 'surreal and unsettling', but it does seem to be real. We need to understand it.' Malcolm Kendrick, a GP and author with an interest in obesity, claimed in his recent book Doctoring Data that being overweight was beneficial. He is suspicious of the word 'paradox' when used with a medical hypothesis: 'It is usually a way of describing something that contradicts your theory. For instance, people who believe high cholesterol causes heart disease use the phrase 'cholesterol paradox' to explain why countries with high levels of cholesterol have low levels of heart disease. They should admit their theory is wrong.' He says that what counts as a normal or 'healthy' BMI has been miscalculated: 'It would make sense if normal was what is now called overweight.' Millions would then not be pushed into losing weight when they did not need to or when it might be harmful. The number of Britons who go on a diet in any given year . These 'paradoxical' results suggest that BMI is too crude a tool on its own to make decisions about what a healthy weight is. It can misclassify athletes packed with muscle as overweight or even obese. Equally, current BMI categories give the wrong picture for what might be called the 'fit fat'; people who may have a lot of fat but also eat well and exercise regularly. Their BMI may classify them as obese, but other markers (blood sugar, fat levels in their blood and blood pressure) can all be in the super healthy range. Apparently healthy-weight people with little muscle mass because they rarely exercise also make BMI an unreliable indicator of health because rather than storing their fat under the skin, they may carry it in their abdomen, wrapped around their organs and pumping out chemical messengers and hormones linked to diabetes, heart disease and cancer. A tape measure is said to be one way to spot if you have this dangerous fat, but leading obesity expert Professor Arya Sharma, chair in obesity research and management at the University of Alberta, disagrees: 'A tape measure still won't tell you whether your stomach fat is unhealthy. Symptoms such as hypertension, diabetes or sleep apnoea are far more informative.' Current BMI categories give the wrong picture for what might be called the 'fit fat' All this suggests it is not a good idea to advise someone to lose weight just on their BMI. Professor Haslam says: 'I'd never do that; I'd need to know about their diet, how much they exercise, what their blood pressure and blood glucose levels were.' He welcomes the latest Alzheimer's and obesity research because it should make people more aware of the complexities of the fat debate: 'We've got too stuck in the idea that when it comes to weight, one size fits all.' Why fatter people should be better protected from Alzheimer's is guesswork, but evidence suggests having more fat reserves when you fall ill is associated with better recovery. 'Heavier people have better survival rates,' says Dr Flegal. 'If you get pneumonia and lose 15 lb, it helps to have 15 lb spare'. Fat is a vital source of the energy needed for recovery and also helps the immune system. Professor Haslam says: 'Those who are elderly or suffering from long-term conditions should be advised to become fitter, but not to lose weight.' One of Dr Flegal's fiercest critics is Professor Walter Willett, chair of nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health. He, too, is concerned that BMI does not provide the whole picture of someone's health but has described Dr Flegal's research as 'rubbish'. He is particularly worried her claims could 'undermine public policies to curb rising obesity rates'. He says they could be 'hijacked by special interest groups such as soft drink manufacturers and food lobbies'. There is no doubt that being obese, and to a lesser extent overweight, is linked to a raised risk of cancers, diabetes, and other chronic disorders. While you might not die prematurely, at the very least you are likely to have a poor quality of life; diabetes complications can include blindness, ulcers and amputations. Nonetheless Professor Haslam believes the new findings cannot be ignored: 'We need to use them to improve the advice and support we give to patients. It's not right to try to discredit them for political reasons.'"
"Quinton ‘Rampage’ Jackson has admitted he has already been through the wringer, even before he steps back into the Octagon. Jackson returns to the UFC after two years with Bellator when he takes on Fabio Maldonado in Montreal on Saturday night. But he had to first endure a protracted legal battle before he was permitted to feature at UFC 186. Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson and Fabio Maldonado face off during the UFC 186 weigh-in on Friday . ‘Everything happens for a reason,’ he said. ‘It was a very stressful period, it was so stressful preparing for this fight. I've never went through this type of thing before. I felt like I had to fight to get here, and that's been a tough fight. 'I probably won't feel any emotions until after the fight or right before the fight. I just wanted to make it here for the fans, though. I feel like the fans wanted to see me fight, a lot of fans bought tickets and wanted to watch the pay-per-view and see this fight so I'm glad to be here. 'He's [Maldonado] good on paper. He's a stand up fighter; on paper it's the type of fight I love so it should be a good show for the fans. But I've heard he's been doing a lot of wrestling so we'll see what happens.’ Jackson, the former light-heavyweight champion, takes on Maldonado at a catchweight of 215lb. Former light-heavyweight champion Jackson has been through a stressful fight to make UFC comeback . 'I'm tired of fighting guys who are cowards, who just want to take you down and lay on top of you. In fights like that, the fans lose,’ he added. 'I am a true definition of a fighter, you know what I'm saying. My style is a brawl, a street fighter. I like the excitement of the surprise of what he's going to bring at me. 'We're both pretty big guys. It was stressful preparing for this fight - it was kind of hard for either of us to keep our weight down. I just think it's fair for both of us [that this is a catch weight fight at 215lbs]. ‘Fighting is mostly mental, even the weight loss part of it. When you're stressing out, there's nothing you can do. The thing you guys want to see is two healthy, strong fighters fighting each other, not people who are killing themselves trying to get down to weight the night before.'"
"NHS bosses have today come under fire after it emerged a hospital paid a temporary nurse £2,200 to cover a single 12-hour shift. The figure, which equates to £183 an hour, was paid by the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. It represents double the rate for a neurologist and was revealed following a Freedom of Information request. It also emerged there were 47 agency nurses working at the trust in December last year. The trust, which runs the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, has been criticised for wasting taxpayers' money. The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust paid £2,200 to a temporary nurse for one 12-hour shift to help amid a shortage of trained nurses, a Freedom of Information request revealed (file picture) Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers will be aghast at the cost of just one shift. 'Agency nurses are far more expensive than their regular counterparts and we have to minimise the number used. 'You can't open a newspaper without hearing how tight finances are in the NHS, but the service has to become far more efficient with the money it already has.' Edmund Stubbs, from independent think tank Civitas, added: 'It is evident that a lack of staff is leading to excessive spending on agency staff, locums and overseas recruitment.' A spokesman for the trust said the £2,200 figure includes VAT, adding that the true figure paid to the nurse, including travel expenses, was £1,864. The shift covered was one in specialist Intensive Therapy Unit on a Bank Holiday. Defending their spending, Sarah Bloomfield, director of nursing at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, said temporary staff had to be used to cover a shortfall in trained nurses. She highlighted their situation is one shared by many hospitals across the UK. She added: 'We have said consistently that we want to recruit more nurses to reduce our reliance on agency and temporary staff and this has been widely publicised with a number of recruitment events taking place recently to attract new staff. 'We have recruited, or made offers to, more than 150 staff nurses and health care assistants in recent months as part of our efforts to recruit more nursing staff to support our wards and departments. Defending the spend Sarah Bloomfield, director of nursing at the trust, said temporary staff had to be used to cover a shortfall in trained nurses. She said in recent months the hospitals have recruited more than 150 nurses and healthcare assistants . 'These new recruits have included a number who have been offered positions through a successful nursing recruitment event at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital just last week, which we will repeat again on Thursday. 'We’ll continue our efforts to ensure that over the coming months we will see fewer agency nurses on our wards as our new starters get settled in, which will mean better continuity of care and more support for ward teams.' Figures obtained by the Nursing and Midwifery Council also revealed nearly a third of nursing recruits in the UK had to be sought abroad last year. NHS spending on temporary staff has rocketed to a staggering £2.5 billion a year because of a chronic shortage of British nurses. The number of foreign nurses and midwives registered in the past 12 months grew to 8,200, up from just 6,200 a year earlier. Around 7,500 came from the EU - particularly Spain, Italy and Portugal - with others came from further afield, including the Philippines. It also emerged that 29 per cent of new nurses were recruited from abroad in the past 12 months, compared to 11 per cent five years ago."
"Pensioners are seven times more likely to develop serious skin cancer today than they were 40 years ago, research shows. Decades of cheap package holidays mean that thousands of retired people every year are paying with their health for sunburn they experienced in their youth. According to Cancer Research UK, men aged 65 and over are around ten times more likely to be diagnosed with malignant melanoma than those of their parents’ generation. Scroll down for video . Pensioners are seven times more likely to develop serious skin cancer today than they were 40 years ago, research shows . And older women are about five times more likely to develop this disease than someone of the same age were in the mid-1970s. Around 5,700 pensioners are now diagnosed with melanoma each year in the UK compared with just 600 a year four decades ago. Many of the patients being diagnosed today suffered cancer-causing sunburn when they were young, experts said last night. Although age is a major risk factor for melanoma, the huge increase is blamed on the cheap package holiday boom dating from the 1960s. Overall, 55.2 of every 100,000 people aged over 65 are diagnosed with skin cancer every year. In 1975 just 7.9 per 100,000 were diagnosed - a seven-fold increase. The figures are part of a worrying increase in incidents that affects all age groups. The continuing obsession with sporting a tan means the toll is likely to keep rising. Getting sunburnt once every two years can triple a person’s risk of developing the disease, scientists suggest . Getting sunburnt once every two years can triple a person’s risk of developing the disease, scientists suggest. Around 13,300 people across a wide range of ages are diagnosed with malignant melanoma in the UK each year making it the country’s fifth most common cancer overall and the second most common cancer in young adults aged 15 to 34. And with sunbeds still very popular, the number of diagnoses is expected to rise to 20,000 a year by 2027. In 1975 the figure was just 1,800. Professor Richard Marais, Cancer Research UK’s skin cancer expert: ‘It’s worrying to see melanoma rates increasing at such a fast pace, and across all age groups. ‘It’s very important for people to take care of their skin in the sun. ‘It’s also important for them to keep an eye on their skin and seek medical opinion if they see any changes to their moles, or even to normal areas of skin. ‘Melanoma is often detected on men’s backs and women’s legs but can appear on any part of the body.’ Each year, 2,100 Britons die from the disease. Dr Julie Sharp, Cancer Research UK’s head of health information, said: ‘Many cases of malignant melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, are preventable by taking precautions in the sun and making sure you don’t burn. ‘Sun damage accumulates over time so avoiding sunburn - and sunbeds - is key, as well as getting to know your skin type so you don’t overdo it on the beach or even in the garden. ‘You can burn at home just as easily as you can on holiday, so remember to spend time in the shade, wear a T shirt and a hat to protect your skin and regularly apply sunscreen that is at least Factor 15 and has four stars. ‘Swapping bad sun habits for good ones could save your life.’ Sue Deans, a 69-year-old retired teacher and mother-of-three from Croydon, south London, who was diagnosed with malignant melanoma in 2000 after having a mole removed, said: ‘I was part of the generation where package holidays became affordable and you could go abroad nearly every year. ‘I don’t think there was much understanding at the time about the impact that too much sun can have on your risk of getting skin cancer. ‘And I loved the sun but suffered quite a bit of sunburn over the years. ‘I’ve always been quite body aware so my cancer was spotted early. ‘I had successful surgery and have been healthy since, but I’m always vigilant in keeping an eye out for anything unusual or persistent that might need to be checked. ‘Now I make sure my grandson knows the dangers of getting caught out in the sun.’"
"The study measured poisonous nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels using 40 sensors in and around the airport.
It then used modelling to predict what would happen in the future.
However, the Aviation Environment Federation (AEF) said the research was ""highly speculative"" and there was no guarantee pollution levels would fall.
Ministers will decide within weeks whether to enlarge Heathrow or rival Gatwick and the environmental impact will play a big part in that decision.
The work was led by the University of Cambridge and has no formal links to any airport or the government.
Prof Rod Jones from the University of Cambridge told the BBC: ""If there is the development of a third runway, we expect there to be a marginal increase in NO2 coming from the airport itself, but that would be against the background of reduced NO2 from other traffic, because of Euro 6 engines and electrification of the traffic fleet.""
In other words, it comes down to traffic on the roads, rather than planes in the air, because that is where the bulk of the poisonous nitrogen dioxide gases come from.
As new, cleaner car, lorry and bus engines become more common, pollution levels should decline, wiping out any increase from a bigger Heathrow.
However, Cait Hewitt, deputy director of the AEF, said that the plan was for the third runway to be operational by the 2020s.
""The assumption would have to be that over the next decade, we'd move from having something like 57% of London's vehicles fleet being diesel vehicles to instead having ultra-clean electric vehicles throughout the capital. There just isn't evidence to suggest that's going to happen,"" said Ms Hewitt.
Prof Jones said using lots of smaller sensors, dotted in hard to reach places, gave them a clearer picture of what was going on.
""By deploying a network of sensors we can tell directly from the measurements, what's been emitted locally from Heathrow airport and what's been blown in, mostly from central London. That's the real strength of the sensor network,"" he said.
""The major result from this study is that we have tested the models far more critically than you can from a single measurement site.""
Currently, the air has climbed above European health limits at several sites near Heathrow. This work suggests that as cleaner engines kick in levels will fall again.
It is a conclusion that tallies broadly with previous research for the government, but that research relied on estimates, whereas this latest work used more accurate, real-world measurements.
Opponents think air quality is the Achilles heel for Heathrow expansion and could be where it is challenged in the courts. That is what happened the last time they wanted to build a third runway.
Keith Taylor, who is a member of the European Parliament's Transport committee and the Green MEP for the South East of England, told the BBC:
""It is entirely speculative to suggest that any assumed reduction in traffic pollution will offset airport expansion.
""The air pollution crisis in the UK responsible for the deaths of an estimated 50,000 people every year, a responsible government would not entertain the idea of endorsing a project that, as the report makes clear, will increase the toxicity of the air we all breathe.
""We need to be striving for the lowest emissions possible, not try to squeak in just under the European targets, by relying on over-optimistic traffic predictions. The right number of new runways is zero"".
Airport expansion has been shoved under a carpet in Downing Street for decades, but now the Conservatives say they want to get on with it.
The current ""hot date"" for a decision is 18 October, but it could change.
Picking Heathrow would put the cat among the pigeons, because a number of high-profile ministers, including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Education Secretary Justine Greening, are against the scheme. Chancellor Phillip Hammond has also favoured Gatwick in the past.
Prime Minister Theresa May could give her MPs a free vote on the issue to avoid anyone having to resign.
Interestingly, Mrs May's constituency sits under the flight-path but it's hard to find her openly opposing expansion. Opponents at the Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise managed to dig out this from her website on May 2010, when the coalition came in and cancelled Labour's third runway scheme. It's not on the website now, they had to use a special archiving service to find it.
Ms May said at the time: ""Like many local residents, I strongly welcome [the] cancellation of the third runway at Heathrow. Expanding Heathrow in this way would have had a detrimental effect on the Maidenhead and Twyford areas by increasing levels of noise and pollution, and today's announcement is a victory for all those who have campaigned against it.""
Her predecessor David Cameron painted himself into a corner over the issue in the run-up to the 2010 election, when he said he would never expand Heathrow if he became PM.
Ministers still have three options: a third runway at Heathrow, a second at Gatwick, or a third scheme that would double the length of one of Heathrow's existing runways.
This latest, million-pound research was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and alongside Cambridge, experts from the universities of Manchester and Hertfordshire, Imperial College London, CERC Limited and the National Physical Laboratory were involved.
Heathrow helped them put the sensors up and British Airways provided some flight data, but neither handed over any money or were involved in the actual work.
Last December, the government told the BBC it had to go away and double-check a few things before making a decision, claiming it was ""subject to further consideration on environmental impacts and the best possible mitigation measures"".
I have asked, but they won't tell me what they've been checking for nigh on a year. And I'm not the only one.
Ravi Govindia, leader of Wandsworth Council, told the BBC: ""We have repeatedly asked for information on the government's latest investigation in airport expansion, but they seem to be operating in secret.
""Our concern is that Heathrow is being consulted on this work while communities surrounding the airport are kept in the dark. Years of detailed analysis have shown that expanding this airport is unlawful and undeliverable.""
Mr Govindia, and plenty of other opponents, argue there's a plane-load of good reasons to biff the Heathrow plan. This study concentrated on NO2, but there are lots of other nasties in the air, then there's the noise, local congestion, cost to the taxpayer from rebuilding the roads, possible air fare rises to pay for it all, and so on and so on.
Even if the government does make a ""quick"" decision, that is just the start of it. Labour backed Heathrow expansion in 2008, but the plan was ditched by the incoming coalition government.
Whichever scheme they pick will meet loud, angry resistance.
Meanwhile in Montreal, the airline industry is inching towards what would be a historic first global deal to curb greenhouse gases. The International Civil Aviation Authority is being asked to agree for the first time that the rise in emissions from aircraft is mostly capped from 2020.
Aircraft would be made more efficient and any extra emissions would be offset by, say, planting trees. Scientists welcome the fact that the industry will face targets, but say they are not tough enough."
"Richards-Ross, 32, revealed in her new book that she had a termination a day before leaving for Beijing 2008, where she won a gold and bronze medal.
She later claimed that every female athlete she knows has had an abortion but the issue is ""not talked about"".
""There is a brokenness there,"" the American told BBC Radio 5 live.
""For me, it was really healing to be able to share that with other friends.
""Now I've had other women reach out to me, not just in track and field but all over the world. They've said 'your courage is helping me to heal myself'. That's meant a whole lot to me.
""I feel bad because I think people misinterpreted when I said 'everyone I know'. I don't intimately know a lot of women in this sport.
""When I started to share my story I was like 'wow', so many women around me have been through the same thing and no matter how close you are, it's something that people don't share.""
Richards-Ross won three Olympic golds in the 4x400m relay for the USA, with her first and only individual gold coming in the 400m at London 2012.
She also claimed seven medals at the World Championships - including five golds - before retiring in 2016.
During her career, the Jamaican-American athlete became well-known for her style on the track - which included wearing make-up and nail varnish while competing.
She hopes that her image, as well as her sporting achievements, will inspire female athletes in the future.
""People ask me 'why do you wear make-up when you run?' and 'why are you so stylish?' and a big part of it for me was to show young girls that you don't have to be butch or masculine to be a great athlete,"" she said.
""I've had so many girls during my career saying 'thanks for making it cool to wear make-up on the track'. My hope is that I've empowered some young women to go towards sports because sport is one of the best life teachers you can have.""
Richards-Ross' time of 48.70 seconds in the women's 400m is the fastest since 2005.
The world record of 47.6 was set by East German athlete Marita Koch in 1985 but there has always been doubt cast over the time.
Koch competed during a period when it is known that East Germany was doping its athletes but she has denied any wrongdoing and never failed a test.
When asked about doping in track and field, Richards-Ross said: ""The more we hear about these horror stories of the best athletes in the world not being clean, it definitely impacts on our sport.
""I think the IAAF [International Association of Athletics Federations] needs to go back as far as they have records to ensure the records we are competing against are clean and fair.
""I want to see the IAAF do everything they can to make sure the sport is clean.""

"The Department for Transport said up to 60 trains, capable of speeds of about 225mph, were needed.
The contract, which will also involve maintaining the fleet, will be awarded in 2019.
The trains are for the first phase of the project, due to open in 2026 and run between London and Birmingham.
Construction will begin later this year and it is expected to reduce rail times between Birmingham and London by 32 minutes.
A second Y-shaped phase of HS2 will open in two stages.
The line from Birmingham to Crewe will launch in 2027, with the remaining construction - which includes a spur taking HS2 to a new station at Manchester Airport - due to finish six years later.
There will be separate contracts in the future to supply trains for this phase.
Transport secretary Chris Grayling said the new railway would carry more than 300,000 people a day.
""Hundreds of jobs will be created in building and maintaining these trains, representing a great opportunity for British-based businesses and suppliers.
""In total 25,000 jobs and 2,000 apprenticeships will be created during HS2 construction and we have held discussions with UK suppliers to make sure they are in the best possible position to win contracts,"" he added.
Friday's launch comes ahead of a formal start of the process in spring 2017, when companies interested in bidding can learn more about the process. Formal invitations to tender will be made in 2018.
Hitachi Rail Europe said it will bid for the contract to build the HS2 trains.
The rail manufacturer is headquartered in London and builds trains at its plant in Newton Aycliffe in County Durham.
Its sales director, Nick Hughes, said: ""Our HS2 trains would be built in Britain, for Britain, and combine world-leading Japanese Shinkansen technology with British manufacturing know-how.""
Gordon Wakeford, managing director of Siemens Mobility, said a manufacturing contract of this scale  was ""exciting news"" for the rail industry and would have a ""positive impact on the wider UK supply chain"".
The company had recently ""ramped up"" its HS2 activity with the appointment of two executives to lead the HS2 rolling stock bid team, he added.
HS2 has been dogged by controversy, with critics saying the scheme poses a threat to swathes of English countryside."

"A former Premier League footballer 'cast his net around' for players willing to take part in a plot to fix lower league matches, a court has heard. Ex-Bolton Wanderers striker Delroy Facey, 34, is alleged to have become involved in the 'ugly side' of his sport by acting as a middleman for two men who have already been convicted of match-fixing. Facey, who also played for West Bromwich Albion and Hull City, denies conspiracy to commit bribery and is standing trial at Birmingham Crown Court alongside former non-league player Moses Swaibu, who also denies the charges. Delroy Facey (right) arrives at Birmingham Crown Court for the start of his trial on Monday. He is accused of being involved in a plot to fix lower league football matches . Facey (right) celebrates after scoring for Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League in 2003 . Opening the Crown's case against both Facey and Swaibu at the start of a three-week trial, prosecutor Nick Mather told jurors they would not need to know anything about football to try the defendants. Mr Mather told the jury panel: 'Football in this case is really nothing more than a means to an end - it's an opportunity to make money. 'It's described sometimes as the beautiful game but football has an ugly side to it as well, and it's that ugly side we are going to be looking at.' After explaining to jurors that match-fixers Chann Sankaran and Krishna Ganeshan were found guilty of conspiracy to commit bribery at a previous trial, Mr Mather alleged that Swaibu was one of the players they had tried to corrupt. Sankaran and Ganeshan, both from the Far East, were at the centre of the conspiracy, the court heard, having travelled to Britain with the specific purpose of fixing matches. Defendant Moses Swaibu (right) on the ball during an FA Cup match between Lincoln and Bolton in 2010 . The Crown alleges that the plot - which aimed to profit from rigged bets - targeted the lower leagues because of the high level of scrutiny surrounding the Premier League. Swaibu played at a semi-professional level between 2009 and 2014, including stints with London-based Sutton FC and Brighton club Whitehawk. Jurors were also given details of Facey's career, which included a spell at Lincoln City in which he earned around £65,000 during the 2010/11 season. Describing Facey's alleged role in the conspiracy, Mr Mather added: 'He was a middleman, a fixer. He was somebody who cast his net around to find players who might be willing to take part in match-fixing.' By the time of the alleged conspiracy in November 2013, Mr Mather told the court, Facey was earning considerably less than previously. 'That may well have been his motivation, the prosecution say, for what took place,' Mr Mather said of Facey's reduced income. Facey (top) in action for West Brom during a match against Norwich City in March 2004 . Informing jurors that another footballer, former Whitehawk FC defender Michael Boateng, was also found guilty at a previous trial, Mr Mather said there was no doubt that an agreement to fix lower league matches occurred. 'This case is not about whether this scheme existed,' the prosecutor told the jury. 'The issue for you to decide is whether you are sure that firstly, Delroy Facey, and secondly Moses Swaibu, was a part of that agreement. 'This case is focused on them and what they did, and why they did it.' Facey, from Woodhouse Hill, Huddersfield, and 25-year-old Swaibu, of Tooley Street, Bermondsey, south London, deny conspiring together with others to commit bribery between November 1 and 27, 2013. Mr Mather said betting on football was not confined to the Premier League and extended from the very top of the sport down to semi-professional leagues. Lower league games in the Football Conference had been targeted, Mr Mather claimed, partly because highly-paid professionals would have to be offered 'astronomical' sums to even think about becoming involved in corruption. Huddersfield's Facey (left) vies with Brentford's Michael Dobson during an old Second Division match in 2002 . The conspiracy came to the attention of the National Crime Agency after initial inquiries by a private investigator who wanted to expose match-fixing led to the identification of Sankaran. A national newspaper then became involved, the court was told, and Sankaran arrived in the UK in November 2013. During a meeting with an undercover investigator on November 16, Sankaran is alleged to have made unsuccessful attempts to contact footballers and made reference to an agent named Delroy who used to play for Bolton. At that point, the court heard, the National Crime Agency took over the investigation, deploying a covert officer to gather evidence. The officer met Sankaran five days later and mobile phones belonging to the defendants, including Facey, were subsequently seized. Mr Mather will continue his opening speech to the jury on Tuesday. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."
"He claims Universal Music have only paid the band a ""miniscule fraction"" of the money they were owed from downloads on sites like iTunes and Amazon.
The musician is suing for compensation, according to legal documents filed in Los Angeles on Wednesday.
The claim is also filed on behalf of his sister, Karen, who died in 1983.
Carpenter hired accountants to examine financial statements from Universal Music and its subsidiary, A&M Records, which has released The Carpenters' music since their debut album in 1969.
He says they found multiple errors, and that the labels ""improperly classified"" revenue from digital downloads of The Carpenters' music as sales of physical records  - which attract a lower royalty rate. He also claims that digital downloads were undercounted.
In a statement, Carpenter said he had been unable to resolve the dispute without suing.
""The Carpenters recordings are among the best sellers in the history of popular music, and after 48 years continue to contribute a substantial amount to [Universal's] annual bottom line,"" he wrote. ""It seems only fair that these companies account fairly to my sister's estate and to me.""
Specialising in radio-friendly soft rock, The Carpenters sold millions of records in the 1970s. The brother-sister duo won three Grammy Awards in 1970 and 1971, including best new artist and best vocal performance for the ballad (They Long to Be) Close to You.
The band's career was cut short when Karen developed anorexia nervosa in 1975. Although they continued to record, the condition eventually led to her death, from heart failure.
Richard Carpenter's legal claim is one of many filed in the US after a 2010 court case involving Eminem, which resulted in a ruling that artists should receive higher royalty payments for digital downloads than they do when a CD or vinyl album is sold.
The difference is substantial. According to Billboard, artists get 15% of the money generated by the sale of a record. For downloads, which are counted as ""licensed content"",  the figure 50%.
Artists including Peter Frampton, Public Enemy, Whitesnake and The Temptations have all sued, or threatened to sue, in order to obtain the higher rate.
Universal Music were not immediately available to respond to the latest case.

"Ministers have set out plans for an ""ambitious new customs arrangement"" with the EU after the UK leaves.
This could include a ""temporary customs union"" after March 2019 to prevent border problems during the process.
However, the first minister said the UK ""should commit to staying in the single market and customs union, period"".
The customs arrangements document is the first in a series of papers to be published by the Westminster government on key negotiation issues. Businesses had called for clarity since the UK announced it was leaving the EU's tariff-free trading area.
Ministers said the plans would mean the ""freest and most frictionless possible trade"" with the rest of Europe.
The newly-published paper says the UK could ask Brussels to establish a ""temporary customs union"" after it leaves the EU in March 2019. During this period it would also expect to be able to negotiate its own international trade deals, which it cannot currently do as a customs union member.
Once any temporary arrangement expired, the paper says the UK would look to agree either a ""highly streamlined"" border with the EU or a new ""partnership"" with no customs border at all.
The plan has drawn a mixed response, with Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer calling it ""incoherent and inadequate"" and ""fantastical and contradictory"". However, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said it was ""encouraging"", and the Institute of Directors said it was ""hugely positive step"".
Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, tweeted that the idea of ""invisible borders"" was ""a fantasy"".
Ms Sturgeon posted an initial reaction to the customs union plan on Twitter, saying: ""Seems UK gov is back to its daft 'have cake and eat it' approach to Brexit. They should commit to staying in single market and customs union, period.""
End of Twitter post  by @NicolaSturgeon
Speaking in Montrose, where the Scottish government's cabinet held a meeting prior to a public discussion event, the SNP leader told BBC Scotland that the plan ""would almost be laughable"" if the issues involved were not so serious.
She said: ""You've got the UK government appearing to say that they don't want to say in 'the' customs union, but they want to stay in 'a' customs union, which would be pretty much identical to the European customs union that we're in already. It's nonsensical and ridiculous.
""I think it increasingly makes the UK government look like a bit of a laughing stock.
""I wish we weren't leaving the EU, but if the UK is leaving the EU then the common sense thing to do is to stay in the single market and to stay in the customs union. Because that will mean we can continue to export goods and services and continue to travel freely like we can today.
""I think the sooner we get into a common sense position the better.""
Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis said he envisioned the future settlement being ""as close as we can to the current arrangements"".
Ms Sturgeon hit out at this, saying: ""Why don't we just stay in the customs union? If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it's a duck.
""They seem to be going to great lengths to differentiate something that is pretty much identical to the customs union from the customs union. That's what makes, I think, the UK government increasingly look a bit ridiculous.""
While customs is a reserved matter, the paper says the UK government is ""committed"" to working with devolved administrations ""to understand the practical impact of new arrangements. It notes ""specific issues"" such as the Irish border and ""implications"" for ports in Scotland and Wales.
Mr Davis said: ""We will take on board their concerns but our primary aim is to look after the people of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This is aimed to help them.
""For example, in NI we want to have an invisible border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and in Scotland we want people who are running businesses there to have frictionless trade, and that's what it's about.""
Scottish and UK ministers are set for further talks about Brexit in the coming weeks after the most recent summit in Edinburgh ended in stalemate."
"This was a key rebel demand during drawn-out talks which led to a peace deal in August. All foreign forces were meant to have left by 10 October.
Meanwhile, a rebel leader has told the BBC the deal is unlikely to work and said he may take up arms again.
Tens of thousands of people have died since the civil war began in 2013.
Uganda's defence chief Gen Katumba Wamala told the press that all soldiers should be out by 1 November.
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Henry Okello Oryem added in a statement that Uganda's intervention ""helped to stop what was likely to be the worst genocide in the region"".
Uganda has not revealed how many troops it has in South Sudan, where they are supporting the government.
But they are stationed in three bases: The international airport in Juba; in Nesitu just south of the capital and at their biggest base in the town of Bor, which is hosting some 3,500 soldiers.
The BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga in Uganda says that a neutral regional force is meant to step in once Uganda withdraws but it is not clear when that will happen.
Senior rebel leader Gen Johnson Oloni said he might resume fighting because of President Salva Kiir's recent decree creating 18 new states.
He called the plan a ""naked power-grab"", the BBC's Tim Franks reports from South Sudan.
He also said the government was undermining the deal with attacks on civilians.
The rebel leader said land appropriations had pushed his ethnic group to use force in the past and they could do so again.
Gen Johnson is head of the Shilluk militia, which has been accused by the UN children's agency Unicef of abducting hundreds of boys and forcing them to become child soldiers.
The US had proposed that he should be subject to a travel ban and assets freeze, along with an army chief, but this was blocked by Russia and Angola at the UN Security Council.
South Sudan's elusive peace:
Five obstacles to peace in South Sudan
Men of dishonour
South Sudan gained independence from neighbouring Sudan four years ago making it the world's youngest country.
Two years later, in December 2013, a conflict erupted after President Salva Kiir accused Riek Machar, his sacked deputy, of plotting a coup.
Mr Machar denied the allegation, but then formed a rebel army.
Much of the fighting has been carried out along ethnic lines, between Mr Machar's Nuer group and Mr Kiir's Dinka, the two dominant ethnic groups in South Sudan."
"Flight cancellations soared by 20 per cent and delays by 7 per cent in the first quarter of 2015. UK passengers faced more holiday chaos than during the same period last year, according to analysis from flight data specialist EUclaim. In the first four months of the year, there have so far been 5,080 flight cancellations, compared to the 4,239 cancellations during the same period in 2014. According to flight data specialist EUclaim, cancellations and delays are on the rise so far this year over last . The number of delays also increased to 2,427 from 2,260 in 2014. It's low-cost carrier Monarch that has seen the greatest increase in delays so far, with passengers suffering 64 incidents compared to 47 during the same period of time last year. That's an increase of 30 per cent. And EasyJet hasn't fared much better, experiencing a 19 per cent increase in delays. During last year's first quarter, there were a reported 206 hold-ups, while this year has already seen 245. However, airlines are refuting the figures. A spokesperson fro Monarch said: 'The recent media report in regards to the on time performance during the first quarter of this year is incorrect and misleading. 'For clarity, during the first quarter of 2015 we experienced winter weather across Europe which has been far worse than the same period last year, which particularly affected our operation to and from France, as well as the recent the French ATC strike which affected many carriers across Europe. It should be noted that during this time frame Monarch Airlines’ did not cancel any flights. 'In the event of strikes or weather disruption, the business model of many other airline carriers is to cancel services; which will protect their on-time performance, but of course have a negative impact on their customers. 'Monarch Airlines will only cancel flights if there is absolutely no viable way of operating that flight thus placing the highest value on getting customers to their destination as opposed to protecting our on-time performance by tactically cancelling our flights.' Low-cost carrier Monarch has fared the worst so far in 2015, experiencing a 30% increase in delays . Despite all the hold ups, it's been a good year for Thomas Cook, which has reduced its delays by 37% . But it may not be entirely the fault of the airlines. Monarch - 39% increase . EasyJet - 19% increase . Jet2 - 17% increase . Virgin - 7% increase . Thomson - 6% increase . Ryanair - 6% increase . British Airways - 11% decrease . Thomas Cook - 37% decrease . Winter weather across Europe this year has been far worse than the same period last year and has particularly affected Jet2, easyJet and Monarch's routes to Chambery and Grenoble in France. Similarly, delays and cancellations could also be attributed to a number of strikes on the continent. The four-day Lufthansa strike in March resulted in some 116 cancellations of flights to the UK. Strikes by Italian Air Traffic Controllers and security staff in Germany also compounded such a problem. Still, despite the external factors, it's been a good year for Thomas Cook, which has reduced delays by 37 per cent, and British Airways also saw an 11 per cent reduction in stoppages. Monarch Airlines contests the EUclaim figures, however, telling MailOnline Travel that 'their source of information is questionable. 'They claim that their data comes directly from the aircrafts on board ACARS and ADS-B systems, but Monarch Airlines use neither of these. 'The reason that our OTP figures appear higher than other airlines is due to the fact that we have not cancelled any flights. 'We put our customers before our OTP and would rather operate with a delay than not at all.'"
"An art student at Syracuse University has taken a positive stand on self love and is sharing her secrets to accepting her flaws through a series of stunning self-portraits - and motivational speaking. Three years ago on New Year's Day, LaNia Roberts was standing in front of her mirror, vowing to change herself - but also to love herself more, after enduring years of cruel comments from her peers, and an ever-present feeling of self-doubt. Now, at only 18, LaNia is sharing details of how she learned to accept herself for who she is – and how, through her love of art, she learned to find beauty within her own appearance. Picture perfect: 18-year-old Syracuse painting student LaNia Roberts recently gave a speech at the university on learning to love one's self unconditionally . The artist: LaNia specializes in self-portraits, which she began painting in high school . Earlier this month, LaNia gave a moving motivational speech titled 'Love Yourself Unconditionally', during which the Louisville native LaNia recounted her journey to self-acceptance and eagerly shared the lessons she has learned. The path to this realization came after LaNia made that New Year's resolution in 2012. She joined the track team at her high school and lost 50 pounds, eventually being able to stand in front of that mirror again and call herself beautiful.  She also began painting self-portraits as a means of embracing her own appearance and finding beauty within every flaw. 'Little did I know that love was so conditional,' LaNia explained in her speech, reports The Daily Orange. 'It was like accepting the terms and conditions that you check when you're making a new Facebook or something.' But then over the summer of junior year, LaNia gained the weight back. 'Every pound that I gained, I lost a pound of love,' she said. 'So you can do the math of how much love I lost for myself. I would look at myself in the mirror and say, ""Oh my gosh.""' Lessons learned: LaNia's journey began after making a New Year's resolution to lose weight and love herself more back in 2012 . Talented: Before coming to Syracuse, the Louisville native had been accepted to a highly-selective art program at The Kentucky Governor’s School for the Arts . However, her paintings tell a different story. 'When it comes to painting a self-portrait, I could turn those things that I didn't really love into something that was beautiful not only to me, but to others,' LaNia told Cosmo. 'Beauty is learned. Beauty is something that we have learned over time,' LaNia told Cosmo. 'Now I'm actually understanding that it's not other people accepting me that leads to happiness.' Focusing more on her artistic flair than her physical appearance, LaNia became more confident, more outspoken, and vowed to take more risks. She was accepted to a highly-selective art program at The Kentucky Governor’s School for the Arts and even had the confidence to confess to a man that she thought he was 'the most beautiful man on this damn earth.' But for LaNia, the real moment of self-acceptance came one night when she was getting ready to go out, and noticed that her jeans were not fitting quite right. 'Little did I know that love was so conditional': LaNia lost 50 pounds after deciding she wanted to change her appearance, but later gained the weight back, which caused her to change her outlook . Taking the stage: LaNia recently decided to share her journey to self-acceptance with her peers . 'My love-handles was poking out a little bit, so I looked in the mirror and said ""Oh, that doesn’t look too good, but somebody’s going to love them someday,""' she explained. LaNia says that she realized then that she could not count on others for validation on loving herself, because, as she told the Syracuse crowd: ' you are the only thing that you are promised your entire life.' 'We learn that if something is flawed, it's supposed to become something else,' she added to Cosmo. 'And I am learning that I, LaNia, my body, everything, it does not need to be like something else.'"

"In return Venezuela accused Chile of ""inadmissible interventionism"" and a ""lack of diplomatic circumspection"".
Braulio Jatar was taken into custody on 3 September after publishing videos of a protest against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
Mr Jatar was born in Chile and also has Venezuelan nationality.
He is an open supporter of the opposition and runs a news website on Margarita island in Venezuela.
The Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based pressure group, called on Venezuela to ""allow all journalists to report freely"".
On Monday. Brazil's foreign minister also criticised the Venezuelan government's actions, saying the country had seen an increase in what he called ""arbitrary detentions"".
Jose Serra told a local newspaper such detentions ""make it even more difficult to have the dialogue between government and opposition that is indispensable for overcoming the dramatic political, economic, social and humanitarian crisis that is affecting Venezuela"".
At the start of September, Mr Jatar released videos of a protest when island residents jeered the president.
Protests have been a regular occurrence in Venezuela as the opposition calls for President Maduro to be removed from power. They blame him for the country's economic crisis and accuse the electoral commission of delaying a referendum that could shorten his rule.
President Maduro accuses the opposition of trying to stage a coup.
Mr Jatar was arrested with about 30 other people on Margarita island. The others have since been released but Mr Jatar is still in detention and his family believe he is not on the island any more.
Some reports said the authorities claimed he had tens of thousands of dollars in cash, which was to be used to attack an international summit starting on Margarita island on Tuesday.
Venezuelan prosecutors have not commented on the detention but the foreign ministry said he was suspected of extortion and fraud.
Chile demanded at the weekend that Venezuela make the journalist's whereabouts known.
The Venezuelan government said it ""rejected"" the demand and accused the Chilean foreign minister of ""bowing to pressure from the most reactionary sections of the bourgeoisie"" who still support General Pinochet, the country's former right-wing dictator.
Chile's response was to say that ""the promotion and defence of human rights do not have borders"" and Mr Jatar had not had access to his lawyer in a week."
"Deaths rates from heart disease between 2004/05 and 2013/14 dropped by 43%, according to official figures.
The number of people dying after a stroke also decreased by 41%.
The Scottish government said the figures showed its strategy for tackling heart disease was working.
Figures from ISD Scotland found the gap in death rates between the most and least deprived communities had narrowed by 33%.
For patients admitted to hospital with their first heart attack, the chances of surviving at least 30 days have risen from 85% to 92% over the same period.
The figures also show a 30% drop in the number of new cases of heart disease.
In 2013 there were 7,239 deaths in Scotland where coronary heart disease was the underlying cause.
Treating and preventing heart disease is a national clinical priority for Scotland.
Public Health Minister Maureen Watt welcomed the figures.
""It's tremendous news that fewer people are developing heart disease or suffering strokes, and that fewer people are dying,"" she said.
""I'm also encouraged to see that health inequalities are reducing in this area, with the gap in mortality rates between the most deprived and least deprived communities falling over time."""
"Fighting lasted for several hours near the city of Mazar-e Sharif in northern Balkh province.
Insurgents targeted those leaving Friday prayers at the base's mosque and others in a canteen, the army said.
The Taliban said in a statement they had carried out the attack, using suicide bombers to breach defences.
Earlier estimates put the death toll as high as 134, but a statement from the defence ministry on Saturday gave the figure of more than 100 killed or injured.
It is one of the deadliest tolls in a Taliban attack on the Afghan army.
At least 10 Taliban militants were also killed in the fighting and one attacker was detained.
The Afghan government has declared Sunday a day of national mourning.
Separately, the US military command in Afghanistan said that Taliban commander Quari Tayib had been killed in a coalition air strike.
It said that Tayib was ""once known as the shadow Taliban governor of Takhar province"" in the north-east, and was killed along with eight other Taliban fighters in the strike on 17 April.
The Taliban fighters who attacked the base wore army uniforms and drove through checkpoints to launch the raid, a military spokesman said.
One injured soldier, Mohammad Hussain, said: ""When I came out of the mosque, three people with army uniforms and an army vehicle started shooting at us. Of course, they had some infiltrators inside the base, otherwise they would never have been able to enter.
""One of them sitting inside a vehicle had set up a machine gun at the car's window and shot everyone in his way.""
President Ashraf Ghani flew to the area on Saturday and visited wounded troops.
US military spokesman John Thomas described the attack as a ""significant"" strike, but he praised Afghan commandos for bringing the ""atrocity to an end"".
There are conflicting reports about casualties. The defence ministry confirmed more than 100 soldiers had been ""killed or injured"" but a security official in Mazar-e Sharif told the BBC that more than 100 had died, including a top military commander.
Relatives of some of the soldiers gathered outside the base to take possession of coffins. They all questioned the security measures in place at the main entrance.
""If strict inspections had taken place, the attackers would not have passed the first gate,"" said Jan Agah, from Jowzjan province. One of his nephews serving at the base died and another was injured in the attack.
The raid shows the Taliban can plan and carry out complex attacks. The militants said four of the attackers had served as soldiers for a long time and had knowledge of every corner of the base.
The base at Mazar-e-Sharif is home to the Afghan National Army's 209th Corps, responsible for providing security to most of northern Afghanistan, including Kunduz province - which has seen heavy recent fighting.
Several German and other foreign soldiers are reported to be garrisoned there.
Last month about 50 people were reported to have died when militants believed to be from the group known as Islamic State targeted patients and staff at a military hospital in Kabul with guns, grenades and knives.
Also in March the Taliban said they had captured the crucial south Afghan district of Sangin after a year-long battle."
"North Korea had requested the body, but has not confirmed its identity.
It was released as part of a deal under which nine Malaysians previously prevented from leaving North Korea have now arrived home.
The two countries had been locked in a diplomatic row in the wake of Mr Kim's murder in Kuala Lumpur last month.
Both countries had banned each other's citizens from leaving.
""The body of the DPRK citizen who died in Malaysia and relevant DPRK citizens have returned to the DPRK today via Beijing,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said during a regular press briefing, using the country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
North Korea is widely suspected of having orchestrated the killing with a nerve agent in Kuala Lumpur's airport.
Three North Koreans who had been wanted for questioning have now been allowed to leave Malaysia, Malaysia's chief of police said.
""We have obtained whatever we wanted from them'' and are ""satisfied"" with the statements, Khalid Abu Bakar said.
In the wake of Mr Kim's killing on 13 February, Pyongyang reacted angrily when Malaysia refused to hand over the body immediately, without an autopsy.
Malaysian authorities said they had the right to conduct an autopsy as he had been killed on Malaysian soil, and that they would only release the body to Mr Kim's family.
On Thursday, Mr Najib said a formal request had been received from the family, but gave no further details.
A day later, national police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said ""legally speaking, Kim Jong Un is the next-of-kin"" but declined to say who the request had come from.
King Jong-nam's own family previously lived in Macau but they are now thought to be in hiding.
His son Kim Han-sol appeared in a video earlier this month confirming he was with his mother and sister at an unspecified location.
Although he was the eldest son of the former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-nam was passed over for the leadership and was living outside North Korea at the time of his father's death.
Malaysia's refusal to hand over the body prompted a war of words. North Korea's ambassador Kang Chol accused Malaysia of colluding with ""hostile forces"", allegations which Kuala Lumpur dubbed as ""delusions, lies and half-truths"".
Kang Chol was expelled and the Malaysian ambassador to North Korea was also recalled.
Pyongyang then said it would ban all Malaysians in North Korea from leaving until the ""situation was resolved"", which Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak called an ""abhorrent act"" that effectively held his citizens hostage.
Kuala Lumpur enacted a tit-for-tat exit ban on North Koreans.
Under the deal, the nine Malaysian nationals returned to Kuala Lumpur early on Friday, where they were met by relatives.
They include the country's counsellor to North Korea, Mohd Nor Azrin Md Zain, embassy staff, and their families.
The exact circumstances of how the deal was struck remain unclear. Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak described the negotiations as ""challenging"".
Foreign Minister Anifah Aman hailed the exchange as a success of diplomacy and ""level-headedness"".
Reuters reported that television footage showed two North Koreans on the flight to Beijing with the body: Hyon Kwang Song, the second secretary at the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur, and Kim Uk Il, a North Korean state airline employee.
The third was named Ri Ji U, who had been holed up with them in the North Korean Embassy, Reuters quoted the chief of police as saying."
"The Fulham fans in the Jimmy Steed Stand applauded their team at the final whistle. It was not the victory manager Kit Symons had called for but a point away to Charlton probably secures their future in the Championship next season. They are eight points clear of Millwall and bar a miraculous resurgence from one of the bottom three sides will stay up but the fact relegation is still mathematically feasible for a club that were in the Premier League last season is alarming. A vertiginous decline, just one victory in their last seven games had seen them dragged back into a relegation battle and after a painful 4-1 trouncing by bitter rivals Brentford last week, Symons was looking for a quick response from his players. Johann Gudmundsson celebrates his first-half effort as Charlton come from behind to earn a point . The Icelandic winger is joined by his Charlton teammates as they celebrate his equaliser at The Valley . He got it with Ross McCormack giving them the lead after eight minutes. A superb long ball by Michael Turner found Matt Smith who headed on to the Scotsman to loop the ball over the top of Charlton goalkeeper Stephen Henderson in front of the 1620 travelling fans in the Jimmy Seed stand. The passage of time has clearly not dulled the bad feeling Charlton fans harbour towards Scott Parker. The midfielder, who missed the Brentford game through illness, departed the club more than a decade ago but his every touch of the ball was greeted by a chorus of boos. Not that it seemed to affect him as he dictated the pace of the game in the early stages, feeding striker Smith well. Ross McCormack headed over a stranded Stephen Henderson with just eight minutes played in London . McCormack celebrates his goal in front of the traveling Fulham fans with just eight minutes played . Charlton Athletic: Henderson, Gomez, Ben Haim, Johnson, Fox, Johann Gudmundsson, Cousins, Diarra, Bulot (Eagles 70) Vetokele (Church 79) Watt . Subs: Bikey Amougou, Wiggins, Lennon, Dmitrovic, Lepoint . Fulham: Bettinelli, Hoogland, Burn, Turner, Husband, Parker, Tunnicliffe, Guthrie,(Kacaniklic 68), Kavanagh (Ruiz 68), Smith, McCormack . Subs: Kiraly, Stafylidis, Woodrow, Rodallega, Donnelly . But Charlton hit back with a 16th minute equaliser. Morgan Fox’s cross bounced across the front of goal and Frederic Bulot swung a leg at it but could not connect. It was left for a waiting Johann Gudmundsson to fire his 10th goal of the season into the top right corner. Goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli, who seemed rooted to the spot, wisely dragged a furious James Husband, who seemed to believe the goal offside, from a confrontation with the linesman. Almost the whole stadium thought Gudmundsson had nabbed his second when Igor Vetokele set him up with the whole goal to aim at but the winger contrived to miss, hitting the side netting instead. The second half was low in quality but high in chances. The visitors seemed reenergised after the interval, forcing a save in the 46th minute. Matt Smith found space in the centre of the box and got his head on a pinpoint James Husband cross but Henderson did well to thwart the effort. Charlton soon asserted control with Tony Watt going close three times before Parker was booked for bringing him down with a late challenge. The Charlton players were outraged when referee Andy Madley awarded Fulham a free kick 25 yards out deep into stoppage time but McCormack blasted the ball over the bar. Joseph Gomez  and Dan Burn fight for the ball during match between Charlton Athletic and Fulham . Fulham now sit 20th in the table eight points clear of fellow London rivals Millwall, but Symons is refusing to relax just yet. He said: ‘We’re definitely not safe until it’s mathematically sure because this league is topsy turvy at both ends and it is going to go to the wire. 'But I can’t be greedy so I will take the point and I was pleased with the performance.’ Tony Watt skips past Danny Gutherie  during the Sky Bet Championship match  The Valley ."
"Fashion designer Alannah Hill is the least likely candidate for skin cancer as she prides herself on her alabaster skin - even going to the extremes of wearing gloves and using a parasol to protect her from the sun. Therefore it was a blessing in disguise when she broke her foot after attempting the shoo her dog out of the way and went to the doctor who spotted a tiny freckle on her fourth toe of her left foot. The Tasmanian-born designer was diagnosed with an invasive malignant melanoma and if she had waited another three months the cancer would likely have spread and become terminal but thankfully she now has a 'very good' prognosis. This from a woman who never even wore thongs or sandals - footwear that is a permanent fixture on Aussies throughout the long hot summers. Hill had no intention of going public about her shocking story until her doctor encouraged her to speak out to educate others on the disease that affects almost half a million people every year in Australia. Alannah Hill was diagnosed with an invasive malignant melanomaHill has had part of her toe removed and a skin graft from her inner thigh . She still remembers receiving the phone call from the doctor's surgery like it was yesterday. 'Hello Alannah, could you come back to the surgery please? We have something we need to talk about,' she told Fairfax Media. 'The flipping over of my heart could be heard for miles.' Hill has had part of her toe removed and a skin graft from her inner thigh and then after about a week doctors will decide if she needs anymore treatment. Alannah Hill, who has never had more than three weeks off, is taking three months off to recuperate . Upon her doctor's insistence, Hill is taking a three-month break from her new clothing label - Louise Love - she severed all ties with her famous namesake label, that she started two decades ago, in 2013. Hill admitted that she hadn't got around to getting her freckle checked due to her busy lifestyle. 'The main thing to remember – and I can't stress this enough – is that we all, unfortunately, believe we are invincible,' she said. 'No matter how small your little mole is, no matter how insignificant it looks, go to your doctor and get it checked.' Hill couldn't stress enough how humans have a bad habit of feeling invincible. She said her reason for not wanting to talk about her cancer was that she didn't want people to pity her. But her doctor urged her to get the 'message out' after telling Hill heart-wrenching stories about all of the patients he has seen who had left it too late. Hill who admits to not having time to get your freckle checked, is telling her story to warn others ."

"The council's licensing and gambling committee blocked a plan to introduce an annual charge for any establishment staying open after midnight.

"Mr Ordonez said Gen Palomino would be investigated over the alleged creation of a male prostitution ring.
The general is also under investigation for alleged illicit enrichment and conducting illegal wiretaps.
Gen Palomino welcomed the probe, which he said he knew would clear his name.
""I hope that the justice system can restore the dignity which has been taken from me through lies and infamy,"" the general said in a statement.
The investigation was triggered by allegations by a police captain who said he had been abused by higher-ranking officers during his time as a cadet.
Mr Ordonez said that allegation had been backed up by a complaint by a now retired police captain.
According to the complaint, young male police cadets were cajoled and threatened into having sex with higher-ranking officers.
Mr Ordonez said that according to the testimony gathered by his office, a senator had also allegedly been implicated in the prostitution ring, called ""Community of the Ring"".
He also said that the alleged incidents had taken place ""with the help and complicity of police officials, including the director general [Rodolfo Palomino]"".
The wiretapping accusations also relate to the case. Allegedly police officers tapped the phones of journalists investigating the scandal.
Gen Palomino has strongly denied any wrongdoing.
He has also denied allegations of illicit enrichment and has provided prosecutors with documents which he says show where his money and properties come from.
He says the allegations are a political vendetta designed to drive him out of office."
"At first glance the rectangular island of Por-Bajin looks like a foreboding fortress or prison, with its regular structure and ruined sections. But it is unknown for certain what the rectangular island and its labyrinthine ruins, located in a lake in deepest Siberia, was actually used for when it was built 1,300 years ago. Historians and scientists are divided, but some experts believe the isolated area may have been built to attract people instead imprisoning them, and suggest it was a summer palace, monastery, or an astronomical observatory. The mysterious island, Por-Bajin, was found in the centre of a remote lake high in the mountains of southern Siberia . A reconstruction sought to show what the island could have looked like before it was ruined . The fortress is located about 3,800km from Moscow near the Mongolian border . The plot thickens as the way it was built, along with the construction materials use, hint at Chinese architectural tradition . The name Por-Bajin translates as 'clay house' in the Tuvan language, and the island sits between the Sayan and Altai ranges, about 3,800km from Moscow near the Mongolian border. The location was first discovered in 1891, and the purpose of island has still not been explained over a century later. More in-depth research took place in 2007 with archaeologists discovering clay tablets of human feet, faded coloured drawings on the plaster of the walls, giant gates and fragments of burnt wood. Experts say the island was built during the period of the Uighur Khaganate (744-840 AD) but it is not clear what their motive would be for constructing a fortress for in such a solitary place – as it is far from big settlements and trade routes. Archaeologists conducted limited and inconclusive excavations at the site in the 1950s and 1960s . The ruined structures have led experts to believe the island was used as a fortress or prison . The island has baffled experts for over a hundred years who say it could have been anything from a prison, to a palace or monastry . The plot thickens as the way it was built, along with the construction materials use, hint at Chinese architectural tradition. Scientists were able to use laser mapping to create a 3D image of what the 3.5 hectare plot could have been used for. Although it is said to be around 1,300 years old, many walls were intact and well preserved with a main structure in the inner courtyard being separated into two parts, covered by a tiled roof walkway supported by 36 wooden columns on stone bases. Isolated ruins! The fortress is connected to other land via a small walkway . Irina Arzhantseva of the Russian Academy of Sciences is now digging here for the Por-Bajin Cultural Foundation to find out just when the complex was built and why . Even more confusing than the debate of why it was created is the question of why it was abandoned. Researches have noted the lack of heating systems on the island, despite it enduring harsh Siberian weather and being located 7,545 feet above sea level. Russian president Vladimir Putin visited the island with Prince Albert of Monaco in 2007 and echoed the confusion. 'I have been to many places, I have seen many things, but I have never seen anything of the kind,' he said. Por-Bajin ('clay House' in the Tuvan language) was long thought to be a fortress built by the Uighurs . The few artifacts unearthed at the site seem to date it to the mid-eighth century . A Chinese roof tile hints at Chinese influences, (right). Russian president Vladimir Putin visited the island with Prince Albert of Monaco in 2007 and said: 'I have been to many places, I have seen many things, but I have never seen anything of the kind'"
"A recent survey has revealed that more than half of UK children don't have any veg, and 44 per cent have no fruit on a daily basis. With childhood obesity on the rise in the UK, these new figures are incredibly alarming. For more than two decades, I've been in the business of helping children get their daily fill of fruit and veg. So I wanted to share some of my feeding wisdom to help encourage healthier, happier children. It's easy to become locked in a battle of wills when it comes to dishing up healthy, nutritious food. Annabel Karmel has shred her tips on how to make children love eating vegetables . My son was a very fussy eater, so I had to think of ingenious ways to ensure he was getting a wholesome balanced diet whilst enjoying what he was eating. Truth be told, ninety percent of children go through at least one lengthy stage of fussy eating. It's so easy to feel frustrated and powerless when your child simply refuses to eat certain foods. But the key is not to give in or give up. Day in, day out, I persisted with new healthy foods, new recipes and creative ways to hide the good bits my son didn't like. In fact, it was coming up with these new and novel recipes that inspired me to create my very first book – Complete Baby and Toddler Meal Planner. While it can be frustrating when a child rejects the food we give them, it's actually the way that we deal with the situation that impact on their eating habits. It's not ideal to let your child get away with not eating certain foods in order to keep the peace. Giving your children a limited number of foods will only escalate their fussiness, and deprive them of the essential nutrients they need to grow and develop. If I am honest, hiding the good bits in a meal didn't always get past my children, but I found it really important to hide my frustrations. Instead, I gave them lots of praise when they ate well or tried something new. Remember, you are not alone! Keep trying out new ideas and eventually you will see positive results. Don't be afraid to quiz other mums on how they get their children eating healthy food. I used to share my recipes at my son's nursery and it felt so good to be able to help other mums in my position. Annabel says that parents should keep trying out new ideas with their children and eventually they will see positive results when it comes to a healthy diet . Tips for helping kids towards their five-a-day . 1. Try making your own healthy junk food using good quality lean meat for burgers, English muffins for pizza bases and a good way to coat homemade fish fingers is to dip them in seasoned flour, beaten egg and crushed cornflakes. For dessert it's easy to make fresh fruit ice lollies from fruit juice and pureed fruits. 2. Some kids can spot a hidden mushroom a mile off, so sometimes the best thing is to be up front about fruit and vegetables, tell them where they come from and why they are so good for you. Giving them facts could make them more interested about what they are eating. I used to offer a starter - a little teacup or saucer of something new that they could try that would be in addition to their main meal. 3. If your child refuses to eat anything other than junk food, don't worry. They will soon find there's not much point making a fuss if you don't react. 4. Without going to unnecessary lengths, try to make sure your child's food not only tastes good but looks good too. Make mini portions in ramekins, make chicken skewers or thread bite sized pieces of fruit onto a straw. 5. Avoid empty calorie snacks like crisps or soft drinks and keep a supply of healthy snacks on hand – maybe have a low shelf in the fridge with cut up fresh fruit and other healthy foods. When children are hungry, they won't wait. 6. Children like to assemble their own food, so you could lay ingredients out in bowls and let your child fill and fold their own wraps or choose their favourite toppings for their home made pizzas. 7. Most children adore cooking and tasks like squeezing fresh orange juice or cracking eggs are well within the capabilities of a young child. It's amazing how being involved in the planning and preparation of a meal can stimulate a child's appetite. 8. My chilled toddler meals are great for packing in the veggies – especially on those busy days. Based on my favourite cookbook recipes, they taste just like homemade and offer up to three of a child's five-a-day . Mini vegetable balls .

"Under the Dome explains the social and health costs of pollution, and was watched by more than 100 million people online, sparking debates.
It was removed just two days after Premier Li Keqiang called pollution a blight on people's lives.
Mr Li had promised to fight it with all the government's might.
The environmental issue has dominated the current session of the Chinese parliament, the National People's Congress, in Beijing.
The newly appointed environmental protection minister, Chen Jining, had praised Under The Dome, telling reporters it should ""encourage efforts by individuals to improve air quality"".
But having initially praised the documentary, China's communist leaders now seem to have banned it, the BBC's Michael Bristow reports.
It appears to tell an inconvenient truth, something the leaders do not want to hear during the current annual meeting of parliament, he adds.
Standing in front of an audience in a simple white shirt and jeans, Ms Chai speaks plainly throughout the 103-minute video, which features a year-long investigation of China's noxious pollution problem.
At times, the documentary is deeply personal. Near the start of the documentary, Ms Chai interviews a six-year-old living in the coal-mining province of Shanxi, one of the most polluted places on earth.
""Have you ever seen stars?"" Ms Chai asks. ""No,"" replies the girl.
""Have you ever seen a blue sky?"" ""I have seen a sky that's a little bit blue,"" the girl tells her.
""But have you ever seen white clouds?"" ""No,"" the girl sighs.
The film watched more than 100 million times
Under the Dome, a year-long investigation of pollution in China, had garnered more than 100 million views in less than 48 hours.
Made by renowned investigative journalist Chai Jing and funded with her own money, the film sharply criticises the Chinese state's lax environmental laws.
As of Saturday, the film was no longer available on popular Chinese mainland video sites.
A link on the Youku website that previously led to the video now prompts the message, ""We're very sorry, Youku was unable to find the page you requested"".
Neither Youku or Ms Chai responded immediately when asked to comment, the Reuters news agency reports.
China operates the world's most formidable online censorship machine, known as the Great Firewall.
Some social media users in China voiced frustration at the removal of the film.
""When will this country be able to face the attitudes of its own people?"" wrote one Weibo user, quoted by AFP news agency.
Another Weibo user quoted by Reuters wrote: ""Some people have the power to completely smother Chai Jing's Under the Dome on the internet but don't have the power to smother haze in this country.""
Alvin Lin, the Beijing-based China climate and energy policy director of the US-based environmental group the Natural Resources Defense Council, said: ""They've made a big deal about air pollution in the last couple of [legislative meetings]. Under the Dome made it so they really really have to talk about it.""
Willy Lam, a political analyst at the Chinese University in Hong Kong, said: ""They are really serious about this except the problem is really entrenched.
""It is intertwined with all aspects of industry and agriculture and so forth, and it's a really difficult problem to tackle.""
The film is still available on YouTube with English subtitles."
"The party is not happy that it was only allocated 25 seconds of airtime which was aired a month before polling day.
The Electoral Commission and the BBC agreed that to qualify for an election broadcast a party has to stand a minimum of 12 candidates in at least six constituencies
The Workers Party said this rule was ""effectively putting a price tag on political airtime and also ensuring that the larger, better financed, parties can perpetuate the political circus without serious challenge or alternative views being aired"".
The party said it plans to meet with both the BBC and the Electoral Commission after polling next Thursday."
"Nigella Lawson is returning to the BBC to host a show about 'back to basics' cooking for the first time since the explosive court case involving her ex-husband Charles Saatchi. The celebrity chef, who last appeared on the channel with Nigellissima in 2012, will present Simply Nigella on BBC 2, a series which focus on 'a new pared-down approach to cooking and eating'. The show will mark Nigella's first solo venture with the broadcaster since the breakdown of her marriage to Mr Saatchi and the subsequent court case, in which she was forced to divulge details of the pair's tumultuous relationship and her own past drug use. Scroll down for video . Nigella Lawson is returning to the BBC for the first time in three years with a new series 'Simply Nigella' She briefly appeared on screen in the U.S as co-presenter for Taste but was stopped from flying to the country after confessing to taking cocaine during that case. The cook, who has famously fronted shows about cooking decadently, said the new show would be about 'food that makes our life easier, that makes us feel better, more alive and less stressed'. It is said to be focussing on 'healthy everyday breakfasts and substantial weekend brunches', as well as 'quick-to-make, lighter suppers that de-stress'. Nigella was at the centre of a very public court case in 2013, after she and Mr Saatchi accused their former assistants of spending £685,000 on credit cards given to them for work purposes. Months earlier, the couple's marriage had come to an abrupt end after Mr Saatchi was pictured with his hand on his wife's throat in a central London restaurant. But Lisa and Francesca Grillo were acquitted of fraud by a jury. It came despite the fact that Francesca, 35, had used her family card to spend £8,000 on designer clothes in a single day. The show will see the celebrity chef focus on 'a new pared-down approach to cooking and eating'. Pictured: Nigella in the premiere of Taste, a show she co-hosted in the U.S (left) and arriving at Isleworth Crown Court in 2013 (right) before giving evidence in the fraud trial of her two assistants . It will be the first time Nigella has appeared on the BBC since the breakdown of her marriage to Charles Saatchi (with whom she is pictured) and the explosive fraud case that followed . Their defence, which involved lurid drug allegations against their former boss, was that the TV cook let them spend whatever they liked providing they kept quiet about her cocaine and cannabis use. The court case also heard Miss Lawson describe her ex-husband as a 'brilliant but brutal man' who grabbed her throat out of jealousy when she idly wished for grandchildren. She claimed he drove her to drugs with his 'intimate terrorism'. Referring to details of her doomed marriage to Mr Saatchi being revealed in court, the 54-year-old said: 'To have not only your private life but distortions of your private life put on display is mortifying'. After their acquittal, the Italian sisters – dubbed 'the greedy Grillos' by the prosecution – said they had merely won their freedom, while Miss Lawson had established herself as a public favourite. Police said at the time they would not be taking any action after Ms Lawson's admission which came after the end of her marriage to Saatchi. The show will air in autumn this year. Nigella's return to BBC2 is just one of a number of new commissions for the station, which were unveiled today. Kim Shillinglaw, director of the station, revealed that at least eight new shows would be aired on the taxpayer-funded channel during the coming season. The Great British Pottery Throw Down, to be presented by Sara Cox, is among the new shows to air on the station and is being advertised as 'the Great British Bake Off's messier cousin'. Publicised with the tagline: 'It's messy, it's hot, it's pottery,' the show will see ten amateur potters thrash it out to try and win the 'master of the wheel' title. The Hairy Bikers have been asked to host a show which attempts to tackle the issues of an ageing nation . Other commissions include the move of popular show Family Guy to the channel, which will move over from BBC3. The Hairy Bikers have also been asked to host a show which attempts to tackle the issues of an ageing population in Old School by taking pensioners into classrooms to try and improve loneliness. Gareth Malone has also been brought back to the station for new show The Naked Choir, which will see him scour the country for would-be stars, and Hair - a show designed to find the country's best hairdresser - will also return for another series. Hugo Blick, who wrote The Honourable Woman and The Shadow Line, is also currently in the process of writing a new drama for BBC2 and BAFTA award-winning Stefan Golaszewski will bring a new comedy series called Mum. Daniel Radcliffe and Bill Paxton will star in new factual drama Gamechanger while a hard-hitting documentary series will follow Greater Manchester Police's new unit investigating sex offences. Gareth Malone (left) has been brought back to the station for new show The Naked Choir, which will see him scour the country for would-be stars, while Daniel Radcliffe (right) will star in new drama Gamechanger . Announcing the new commissions, Ms Shillinglaw said: 'BBC Two is in great shape. From the critical and ratings success of Wolf Hall, BBC Two's biggest drama series in at least 13 years and Banished, which was our fourth highest drama series launch, to stand out seasons on Food, The Super Rich And Us, Taking Liberties and our Holocaust Memorial content, we've got people talking and watching the channel in significant numbers. 'The sheer range and quality of content I'm announcing today demonstrates the unique role BBC Two plays in enhancing people's lives and contributing to the creative life of the UK. 'From enabling British writing, presenting and directing talent to do their most distinctive, signature work to Factual with real purpose that tackles contemporary issues in lively, intelligent ways or encourages viewers to take their passions further, I want BBC Two to be the place to come for widest range of grown up, opinionated and entertaining content on British television.'"
"Football supporters submitted a Freedom of Information request to obtain the tenancy agreement amid claims the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) would subsidise the rent.
An Information Commissioner has said LLDC, which denied the claims, must now comply with the FOI request.
LLDC had refused to reveal its rent on grounds of commercial sensitivity.
The decision comes ahead of West Ham moving into the stadium for the start of the 2016-2017 football season.
In reaching a decision dated 3 September, the commissioner said neither West Ham nor LLDC had been able to show how revealing the details of the tenancy agreement would place them at a commercial disadvantage or how this information could be exploited by a competitor.
The stadium was built using tax payers' money and is currently in public ownership.
LLDC manages the stadium and is believed to be considering whether to appeal against the independent commissioner's decision.
A coalition of 14 supporters' trusts from around the country called on LLDC head, London Mayor Boris Johnson, to waive its right to appeal.
They said an appeal would further delay the publication of the tenancy agreement, which they argue is in the public interest.
In a statement, the trusts said the deal raised issues over the apparent use of public money to ""subsidise a commercial football business"".
""It seems the taxpayer will be paying the cost of a series of overheads which every other club, rightly, has to pay for themselves,"" they said.
""It is important that the taxpayer is allowed to know exactly what has gone on here, and to judge whether it is a responsible and fair use of public money.""
The supporters' trusts had argued the Olympic Stadium deal could give the Hammers a competitive advantage and asked the government to investigate in August, but the government said the deal had been ""scrutinised"" and rejected their request.
Previously a spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: ""West Ham United has a concession at the stadium and their contributions reflect that status.
""The contract, awarded after an open public competition, has been widely scrutinised and tested in court. The stadium remains in public ownership and the profits from its multiple uses will flow to the taxpayer.""
The Olympic Stadium deal allows West Ham to host all of their home matches at the stadium. British Athletics will take control of the arena for one month every summer.
LLDC has until 8 October to reveal the commercial details of the Olympic Stadium tenancy agreement."
"The case of the missing planes was raised when PM David Cameron met Burmese President Thein Sein.
A Downing Street source said it was ""hoped this will be an opportunity to work with the reforming Burmese government"".
The exact location of the planes is unknown.
The planes were buried in 1945 by the RAF amid fears that they could either be used or destroyed by foreign forces, but in the intervening years they have not been located.
At the time they were unused, still in crates, and yet to be assembled.
Until a general election in 2010, Burma was ruled for almost half a century by a military junta.
It has been reported that experts from Leeds University and an academic based in Rangoon believe they may have identified the sites where the craft are concealed using sophisticated radar techniques.
On Friday, officials said President Thein Sein was ""very enthusiastic"" about the prospect of finding and restoring the planes.
A Downing Street source said: ""The Spitfire is arguably the most important plane in the history of aviation, playing a crucial role in the Second World War.
""It is hoped this will be an opportunity to work with the reforming Burmese government, uncover, restore and display these fighter planes and get them gracing the skies of Britain once again."""
"Riddick Bowe was once seen as the world's best heavyweight fighter and reportedly had $15million, but he is now offering to post tweets for $20 . He was once the double heavyweight champion, with a career that allowed him to retire from the ring with a rumoured fortune of $15million. Now Riddick Bowe, of Maryland, has found himself tweeting happy birthday messages and adverts for insurance firms for anyone who pays him $20. The 46-year-old recently offered to 'tweet anything' for people who credit him through PayPal, sharing the messages with his 450,000 followers. His offer seems a far cry from the fame he enjoyed in the 1990s as the only man who could beat Evander Holyfield. Bowe explained his plan to this thousands of followers in a post. He said: 'I will tweet anything to anyone just paypal me $20 bowe@riddickbowe.com. Thats whats up. Bowe . And as apparent proof of his pledge a number of bizarre messages have since appeared on the former boxing champion's Twitter account. One post read: 'I tell you all now @JakeLeeYes is twice the fighter I ever was. Thats whats up. Bowe' And in others he posted messages from people asking for dates and venting their frustrations at taxi drivers, as well as promoting websites, small businesses and hotels. He wrote: 'Im now in the business of endorsing yo companies helping those small business get off them ground Im try help the little guy thats what i do.' His actions seem a fall from his hey day in the 1990s when Bowe was widely regarded as the best heavyweight fighter in the world. He motched up victories over former champion Evander Holyfield in 1992 at Caesars Palace and Andrew Golota, who was disqualified for low blows. He retired in 1997 and went on to join the Marine Corps Reserves, but dropped out while he was training. Next the boxer's fortunes were to take an even more disastrous turn after he was imprisoned for 18 months for domestic violence after he held his now ex-wife and children against their will. In 2004 he returned to the ring and won three bouts in unconvincing fashion. Bowe posted a message to his 451,000 followers offering to post any messages they wanted, and his tweets since then - from asking for dates to promoting companies - has proved that he means his offer . By 2005 Bowe had filed for bankruptcy - a stark contrast to the days when he was rumoured to have $15million career earnings. His last fight was a win over Gene Pukall in Germany in 2008. By 2009 he was at a New Jersey flea market, according to the New York Times, selling his wares and speaking of his aim to return to the ring. In 2013 Bowe made a comeback as a Muay Thai fighter, but was spectacularly beaten in the second round. At the time he said he had tried the sport because he was bored of retirement and needed the cash. Bowe (right) faced Evander Holyfield (left) in 1992 and became the first person to beat the undefeated boxer . Bowe (left) is pictured in 2004, having beaten his opponent Marcus Rhode at Fire Lake Casino Oklahoma . The boxing champion has a chequered history with Twitter - being forced to apologise last year after he posted a message saying he wanted all Liverpool fans to die. He later said his message was a joke, as a dedicated Everton fan. In the 1990s Bowe became renowned for his victory over Holyfield, who has suffered a similar loss of his fortune. Holyfield beat Bowe the following year in a rematch and also scored several victories over Mike Tyson. But most of Holyfield's £150million fortune has now gone, frittered away on gambling, funding three expensive divorces and maintenance payments for some of his 11 children."
"All but one Welsh council had resettled refugees from the UK government's Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme by the end of last December.
Councils had been criticised for the speed that they were housing people.
Oxfam Cymru welcomed the figures, with Conwy and Denbighshire the latest authorities to become involved.
The charity's Matthew Hemsley said: ""Wales has a proud history of welcoming those in need and it is important to see that tradition being continued.""
The majority of the refugees in Wales were taken in the second half of 2016 - 285.
A total of 5,454 people have been resettled in the UK.
The figures from the Home Office come after the Welsh Local Government Association said Syrian refugees were expected to have been housed in all council areas across Wales by the end of 2016.
In August 2016, it was reported that only nine of Wales 22 councils had taken part up to the end of June.
The statistics said that one authority - Pembrokeshire - was yet to house refugees from the programme at least by the period covered by the figures, which run from October 2015 to December 2016.
However the council says it plans to resettle a family in the county by the beginning of April."

"It is eight long, barren years since an English club claimed the top prize in European rugby and the bookmakers aren't convinced the grim cycle can be broken this year. When Wasps claimed the Heineken Cup in 2007 with victory over Leicester, it seemed unthinkable that the Premiership would not produce another continental champion for so long. Yet since then Irish teams have seized four titles — Leinster claiming a hat-trick — and French teams three, accurately reflecting the balance of power in the European game. This season is not seen as any real exception, despite the presence of four English sides in the last eight of the new Champions Cup. There is a consensus among the bookies that holders Toulon are destined to finish on top of the pile for the third successive year, with Clermont their primary challengers followed by Racing and Leinster. The Aviva Premiership quartet are all away from home this weekend and are all firm underdogs. Francois Louw runs with the ball during the Bath Rugby training session held at Farleigh House . Bath's George Ford practices his kicking during the training session at the Farleigh House complex . Leinster's Jamie Heaslip is tackled by Sailosi Tagicakibau during the Champions Cup match with Wasps . In World Cup year it would provide a clear boost to national morale if one of their elite clubs could shatter the status quo by lifting the trophy on May 2 but there are significant reasons why an English triumph shouldn't happen. The first comes down to money. Northampton, Saracens, Bath and Wasps are well-funded, with strong squads, but their resources are modest compared to French powerhouses Toulon, Clermont and Racing, who have budgets three or four times the size of their Premiership opponents. Across the Channel, squads are awash with Test-class players from around the world, even on the bench. Meanwhile, Leinster have superb recent European pedigree and benefit from the Irish system which sees top players rested from league duties in order to peak on these major occasions.Bath will find themselves in hostile territory at the Aviva Stadium, but they went to Toulouse in January and scorched the earth to win 35-18. If their pack can go toe-to-toe with the hosts, the likes of Jonathan Joseph are capable of wreaking havoc. Make no mistake, Mike Ford's team are capable of winning in Dublin. Also on Saturday, Northampton face an arduous task in trying to storm the Stade Marcel Michelin fortress where Clermont are on a 22-match unbeaten run in Europe. The Saints are the only English team to win an away quarter-final against French opposition — beating Biarritz 7-6 in 2007. English sides have lost the eight other quarter-finals they have played across the Channel.

Nothampton's Stephen Myler (left) and Luther Burrell (right) prepare to tackle Jamie Roberts of Racing Metro . The current Premiership champions were losing Heineken Cup finalists in 2011. To reach that stage again would require a monumental result this weekend, but Clermont are far from infallible, as Saracens proved, thrashing them 46-6 in last season's epic semi-final. The London club lost to Toulon in the final, but they have been the standard-bearers for English rugby in the last two seasons and will believe they can go to Paris and beat Racing, who can be wildly inconsistent. Wasps captain James Haskell provides a link back to the club's distant 2007 success, but Dai Young's men will be confronting a multi-national force in Toulon that would beat most Test teams. If they were to stun the holders, it would go down as one of the greatest shocks in European competition. There is a fair chance that one English team can progress, with Bath and Saracens the more likely candidates. If two were to make it, that would provide a colossal and timely boost to national morale. Wasps captain James Haskell receives a pass during the training session at Twyford Avenue Sports Ground ."
"Every week in the heart of Nima, a slum in the Ghanaian capital of Accra, families congregate at a local mosque. When the time comes, young girls say goodbye to their loved ones and part ways, filing up concrete steps leading up to the floor above. There, inside a large room dotted with brown tables, rows of flashing computer screens await for them. ""When the parents are praying [downstairs], we are teaching the girls upstairs,"" explains tech entrepreneur Regina Agyare, who comes here every week to teach local teens how to code. Agyare's first visit to see the girls -- students at education project Achievers Ghana -- was in January 2014. This was supposed to be a one-off seminar as part of her mentorship initiative ""Tech Needs Girls"" -- however, the students proved quite a draw. ""I fell in love with them, so I decided to set up a coding club and started having regular sessions,"" says Agyare, founder of software development company Soronko Solutions. More importantly, continues Agyare, it offered the opportunity to show ""the community the value of educating girls."" A predominantly Muslim area in a largely Christian nation, Nima has one of the densest populations in Accra. Agyare says life is often challenging for many  local girls, with some growing up without ever leaving the community. ""Girls were being forced to marry early; [denied] their right to go to school. Most of their dreams and aspirations were limited to just what was around them. ""I was shocked... I thought we had progressed as a nation. I thought we had gone past that."" This, in part, was why Agyare lent her support to Achievers Ghana. Set up by local Amadu Mohammad, the non-profit organization supports 250 girls between the age of six and 18, priming them for formal education through extracurricular classes in reading, math, poetry and information technology. Its goal is to break through social barriers and provide Nima with a generation of female role models, and so the group provides school funding to help the girls shape their own future. The project was bequeathed its classroom above the mosque it shares a building with, and Agyare says the two work closely together. Achievers Ghana met initial resistance from local conservatives, but when the mosque's chief imam Sheik Hussein Abdul Rahman championed Mohammad's vision, few maintained their reservations. Now, with parents paying a nominal fee towards the running of the organization, it is in everyone's interest that the girls succeed. Fourteen months after her first visit, Agyare's coding class is well established. She has set up a mentor scheme as part of ""Tech Needs Girls,"" recruiting and training women at university to act as role models for her younger students in Nima. In each class, around 50 girls are taught HTML and run a blog called ""Slum Voices"". ""I definitely feel [technology] has given them more of a voice,"" Agyare says. ""I feel like it's allowed them to express themselves and interact with others... for them, it's important to be heard."" Some girls had never used a computer before the classes began, but Agyare's even-handed approach has brought all her students up to the same standard. Agyare insists that ""we don't leave anyone behind."" To that end, a few young male faces have found their way into her classroom. This was an accidental revelation, according to Agyare. She details the story of one affronted boy. ""He wrote that he didn't like it when he saw girls learning about computers... it was difficult [for him] to see girls being empowered; he wasn't used to that."" Agyare realized that by integrating genders in her classroom she could begin to confront gender expectations. For many boys the role of a girl is ""to be their wife,"" Agyare explains, ""and she needs to be taken care of."" However, by running mixed classes boys from an early age ""can learn to see a woman as a contributing person [within society]."" Now the hope is that many of the young students will be able to go to university -- and Achievers Ghana is working on a scholarship program to make the prospect attainable. Agyare says the goal is not to turn every girl into software developers but to enable them to ""use technology in whatever field they find themselves."" She adds: ""It would be great if we had some girls that decided to go on and study computer science, but really it's about helping them reach their full potential ... and bring change to the community.""

"The rare mineral, only found beneath Treak Cliff Hill, near Castleton in the Peak District, is so called because of its distinctive colour.
The new vein has been named the Ridley Vein after Gary Ridley, the miner who found it after attempting a new mining method with a stone chainsaw.
He said he could not ""believe his eyes"" when he came across the Blue John.
The stone was fashionable during the Regency period in the early 1800s and is displayed at Buckingham Palace and Chatsworth House.
Mr Ridley, who manages Treak Cliff Cavern, said he tried out the new saw near the tourist route.
""Having spotted a small amount of crystallisation near the handrail it was just an easy and convenient place to see how well the saw would cut...
""I couldn't believe my eyes when within a few minutes I had uncovered a substantial deposit of Blue John unlike any other vein I had ever seen before.""
Vicky Turner, whose family have owned and managed Treak Cliff Cavern since the 1940s, said the Ridley Vein has ""swirling patterns of purple and blue"" and will be made into decorative bowls and other pieces.
Each vein has its own colour and banding of blue, purple, yellow and white. Historically, there have been 14 distinct veins of Blue John including Millers Vein, Treak Cliff Blue Vein, 5 Vein, 12 Vein and Old Tor Vein.
The Ridley Vein has now entered the record books as variant number 15."
"A former High Court judge who led the inquiry into the Bradford stadium fire which killed 56 football fans has dismissed claims the blaze was not an accident saying they are 'nonsense'. A new book by author Martin Fletcher has revealed a series of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time of the tragedy in 1985. The official inquiry into the blaze, led by Mr Justice Oliver Popplewell, concluded that the fire was an accident, probably caused by a spectator dropping a cigarette into rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand at the Valley Parade ground. Former Bradford City chairman Stafford Heginbotham, left, with Mr Justice Popplewell in the aftermath of the Bradford City fire. Today, the former judge has dismissed claims the blaze was not an accident . The stand at the Valley Parade ground burns after a fire in 1985. 56 football fans were killed in the tragedy . Today Sir Oliver was asked about the new allegations in an interview on BBC Radio Leeds, where he rubbished Mr Fletcher's claims. The retired judge said the main flaw in the argument that the fire was arson was that the stand involved had no insurance value as it was due for demolition. He also added that the fire was examined by experienced and thorough investigators, who found nothing suspicious and that no question of arson was ever raised in civil legal proceedings. He explained: 'I'm sorry to spoil what is obviously a very good story but I'm afraid it's nonsense for a number of reasons.' Sir Oliver also rejected claims his inquiry was held too quickly, three weeks after the fire. He added: 'I can quite understand after having previous fires some suspicion being raised but, as far as I’m concerned, we conducted our inquiry perfectly properly and I have no reason believe it was other than an accident.' The new claims about the fire at Valley Parade are contained in the book Fifty-Six by Mr Fletcher, who was 12 at the time and escaped the blaze. Author Martin Fletcher has revealed a series of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time of the tragedy in 1985. He is pictured here with his mother Susan as a 12-year-old . The fire broke out near to half-time during Bradford's game against Lincoln City on May 11, 1985 and within four minutes the stand was completely ablaze. Mr Fletcher lost three generations of his family in the tragedy, including his 11-year-old brother Andrew, the fire's youngest victim, as well as his father John, 34, uncle Peter, 32, and grandfather Eddie, 63. The book, published today and being serialised in The Guardian, does not make any direct allegations but Mr Fletcher says Mr Heginbotham’s history with fires, which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around £27 million in today’s terms, warranted further investigation. He asks: 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham had been?' The disaster also occurred at a time, according to Mr Fletcher’s evidence, when the businessman was in desperate financial trouble - and two days after he discovered it would cost £2million to bring the ground up to safety standards required by Bradford’s promotion from the old Third Division. The fire at the ground broke out close to half-time during Bradford's home game against Lincoln City on May, 11, 1985 . An official inquiry found that the fire was started by accidentally when a fan discarded a cigarette on to rubbish below the timber stand . Mr Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, which took place three weeks after the fire . Mr Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, describing it as inadequate and saying it took place far too close to the event. Meanwhile Mr Heginbotham’s son James, 47, has defended his father, who died in 1995. He told told the Daily Mirror: 'When you actually do your homework and see what he did for Bradford City Football Club it is a sickening accusation. It is just absolutely ridiculous. 'He never recovered from the fire. The stress of it is what killed him eventually. 'He’s no longer here to defend himself. It’s a real shame it has come to this.' Meanwhile, yesterday former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe said the new allegations do not justify a new inquiry into the disaster. The remains of the stand after the fire. West Yorkshire Police said the force would consider any new evidence about the blaze, which also injured 265 people . Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited Valley Parade to survey the damage to the stand and pay her respects with her husband Dennis . Mr Sutcliffe, MP for Bradford South and deputy leader of Bradford City Council at the time of the tragedy, said he knew Mr Heginbotham 'flew by the seat of his pants' in terms of the finances of the club, but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry. West Yorkshire Police said the force would consider any new evidence about the fire. Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley, of the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: 'The jury at the inquest in 1985 delivered a verdict of misadventure. 'However should any evidence come to light which was not available to Her Majesty’s Coroner at the original inquest, then we will consider its significance and take appropriate action.' A minute’s silence is due to be held at every Premier League and Football League match on Saturday, April 25 to mark the forthcoming 30th anniversary of the fire. It was the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land. The final of game of the season should have been a day of celebration for Bradford City. Before kick-off the team were presented with the trophy for winning the Third Division title as 11,076 fans watched on. But instead, May 11, 1985 ended in tragedy as flames engulfed the Main Stand at Valley Parade. The Valley Parade blaze is considered the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land . The fire was spotted at 3.40pm towards the end of the first half and within minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was fully ablaze. The disaster left 56 supporters dead and a further 265 injured. In the years that followed,  new legislation was introduced governing safety at the nation's sports grounds. The tragedy brought about an unprecedented  community spirit in the city, with, among many other initiatives, a fundraising drive for the Burns Unit at Bradford Royal Infirmary. In 2010, on the 25th anniversary, there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city's Centenary Square but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to Valley Parade."

"A pair of turkey-sized ‘egg thief lizards’ dubbed Romeo and Juliet were found lying next to each other in a 75-million-year-old rock in the mid-90s, but it has taken until now for experts to determine the sex of the 'lovers'. Now, researchers believe they have come up with a way to tell fossils of small feathered male dinosaurs from those of females. They say that the key differences between the sexes lie in bones near the base of the tail. A pair of turkey-sized ‘egg thief lizards’ dubbed Romeo and Juliet were found lying next to each other in a 75-million-year-old rock (pictured) in the mid-90s. Palaeontologists led by Scott Persons (pictured) believe they can tell males and females apart from certain tail bones . Paleontologistsat the University of Alberta examined a pair of fossils found in Mongolia, which were first described in 2001. One is a complete skeleton, while the other is missing the middle and end of its tail. ‘Determining a dinosaur’s gender is really hard,’ said graduate student Scott Persons, who is lead author of the study, published in Scientific Reports. ‘Because soft anatomy seldom fossilises, a dinosaur fossil usually provides no direct evidence of whether it was a male or a female.’ So instead, the researchers looked at indirect evidence of sexually dimorphic display structures, which are evident today in birds. Examples include the fans of peacocks, the tall crests of roosters or the long tail feathers of some birds of paradise, which are used to attract and court mates. They are almost always much larger in males who do the courting, than in females, who do the choosing. They suggest that male oviraptors had broader and longer chevron bones in their tails so they could shake their feather-tipped tail to woo potential mates (illustrated), much like modern peacocks . The team theorised that like birds, small feathered dinosaurs such as oviraptors used long feathers on their tails to attract mates, rather than for flying. ‘My analysis of the tail skeletons supported this theory, because the skeletons showed adaptations for both high tail flexibility and enlarged tail musculature - both traits that would have helped an oviraptor to flaunt its tail fan in a mating dance,’ Mr Persons said. After studying the fossils carefully, his team found signs of sexual dimorphism in the length and shape of blade-like bones called chevrons, which point downwards from the vertebrae near the base of the tail. A number of chevrons in one of the fossils were longer and had broader tips than those in the other specimen, indicating the creature is male, the experts said. They suggested that males had larger chevrons to anchor the muscles that controlled their flexible, feather-tipped tails. The researchers suspect that male oviraptorosaurs shook their tail feathers in intricate displays to woo potential mates, akin the behaviour of modern-day peacocks. They suspect females had shorter chevrons to make laying eggs easier. Scientists have recently shown that peacocks shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear. Their mating ritual may bear some resemblance to that of small feathered dinosaurs . Scientists have shown that peacocks (stock image) shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear . Scientists have shown that peacocks shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear. Male birds may make the infrared rumble to scare off an approaching rival or to attract a mate. Researchers at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, have shown that the birds make infrasound noises - below 20 hertz - using their tails and that other peacocks respond to them. Humans hear a rustling sound when this happens, but the experts found that the birds hear a loud sound of between 70 and 108 decibels, according to the study published in the journal Animal Behaviour. Male and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers, with males shrieking out in response. Experts are unsure how the birds detect infrasound, but know that some can feel vibration through their legs. Graduate student Angela Freeman observed that male peacocks were most likely to make the low sounds when they showed off their train feathers, producing two displays which she called the ‘shiver train’ and the ‘pulse train’. The shiver train is produced by vibration of the train feathers from the centre feathers to the outside of the array and is used by males when females are far away. The pulse train is produced by a vibration emanating from the base of all the train feathers and it is used when the female is nearby. Peacocks’ tails are a sign of strength and good genes, so a strong noise may reinforce a message of virility, Ms Freeman said. This could be especially useful as the birds live in scrubby woodland, where high noises can only travel over short distances and birds sometimes can’t see each other. ‘We think that possibly these signals could signal to females and males who are out of sight behind a bush or over the hill,’ she added. The two raptors were discovered in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. Both died and were buried next to each other when a large sand dune collapsed on top of them, creating the interesting fossil. When they were first unearthed, the two oviraptors were given the nicknames Romeo and Juliet because they seemed reminiscent of Shakespeare's famously doomed lovers. ‘We discovered that, although both oviraptors were roughly the same size, the same age and otherwise identical in all anatomical regards, “Romeo” had larger and specially shaped tail bones,’ Mr Persons said. ‘This indicates that it had a greater capacity for courtship displays and was likely a male.’ By comparison, the second specimen, Juliet, had shorter and simpler tail bones, suggesting a lesser capacity for peacocking, and has been interpreted as a female. According to Persons, the two may very well have been a mated pair, making for a romantic story, as the dinosaur couple was preserved side by side for more than 75 million years. While the theory is compelling, Thomas Holtz, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Maryland in College Park told Nature that it’s not yet completely convincing, because only one pair of oviraptor specimens have been studied. Therefore, there is a possibility that the difference in Chevron shape was a variation, rather than a sign of sexual dismorphism."
"Former NFL cornerback Will Allen and his business partner are facing civil fraud charges from federal regulators over allegations the pair ran a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme. They're accused of reaping more than $31 million in a Ponzi scheme that promised high returns to investors from funding loans to cash-strapped pro athletes. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges Monday against William D. Allen, Susan Daub and their Capital Financial Partners investment firms. Allen, 36, was a cornerback in the NFL from 2001 to 2012, playing for the New York Giants and the Miami Dolphins. Accused: Former NFL cornerback Will Allen and his business partner are facing civil fraud charges from federal regulators over allegations the pair ran a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme (file photo) He was signed by the New England Patriots in March 2012 but was placed on injured reserve the following August, and he left football in March 2013. Daub, 54, is a financial professional who also lives in Florida, according to the SEC. The SEC said Allen and Daub paid about $20 million to investors but received only around $13 million in loan repayments from athletes. To make up the gap they paid investors with other investors' money rather than actual profits on the investments, in a classic Ponzi scheme, the agency said. The SEC said Allen and Daub misled investors about the terms and even the existence of some of the loans, telling them they could receive interest on the loans of up to 18 percent from the athletes. The pair used some funds from investors to cover personal charges at casinos and nightclubs and to finance other business ventures, the agency alleged. The SEC's criminal complaint quoted the website for Capital Financial as saying 'In many cases, athletes' contracts do not allow them to access their guaranteed money during the off season or early in the season when they may need a significant sum to purchase a house or car, pay the bills, or meet a financial demand. 'By pooling the resources of a network of investors, CFP gives athletes access to money when they need it while providing investors with solid, short-term returns on investment.' The SEC said its lawsuit against Allen and Daub was filed under seal in federal court in Boston last week and unsealed on Sunday. The agency won an asset freeze against them from the court last week. Two of their firms are based in Boston. Scam: The SEC alleges that Allen and his business partner Susan Daub used some funds from investors to cover personal charges at casinos and nightclubs and to finance other business ventures (file photo) The SEC is seeking an injunction against Allen and Daub and the firms, as well as unspecified penalties and restitution of allegedly ill-gotten gains. Paul Levenson, director of the SEC's regional office in Boston, said in a statement: 'The defendants sold investors on the idea of lending money to pro athletes, but we allege that’s not where a large portion of the investors’ money went. 'As in any Ponzi scheme, the appearance of a successful investment was only an illusion sustained by lies.' The telephone wasn't answered at a listing for Will D. Allen in Davie, Fla., where Allen is said to live. A person answering the phone at Daub's home said there was no comment. They are not represented in the case by attorneys, according to the SEC."
"A woman stabbed her boyfriend through the heart after he arrived home to find her in a short dress and stockings about to have sex with her lover, a court heard. Natasha Elderfield, 41, chased her partner off the boat they shared after he discovered her below deck with her lover, whose trousers were around his ankles, a jury was told yesterday. The court heard how she flew into a rage when boyfriend Robert Dobinson interrupted her attempts to have sex with another man. Natasha Elderfield, 41, is on trial at Oxford Crown Court accused of the murder of her boyfriend Robert Dobinson, 33, in Abingdon, Oxfordshire . She told police officers who arrested her, ‘my God, it’s so ******g funny’, after stabbing Mr Dobinson and leaving him to die on the banks of the Thames, the jury was told. Mr Dobinson, 33, had been dating mother-of-two Elderfield for about two years. The couple had had sex in the morning of the day he was killed, the court heard. The court heard that Elderfield’s lover, Tony Steggles, had brought a large amount of alcohol to the boat, and a ‘sulky’ Mr Dobinson had left to spend the afternoon with a friend. As Elderfield and Mr Steggles spent the afternoon drinking and dancing, Mr Dobinson repeatedly called his girlfriend in a jealous rage – with his constant interruptions making her more and more infuriated. At one point, she became so enraged that she called the police, telling the 999 operator ‘he’s had his ******g due, I’m not having this any more’. The court heard how, within ten minutes of that phone call, blood-soaked Mr Dobinson was staggering desperately along the bank of the river, yelling ‘help me, I’ve been stabbed’. Describing the afternoon the two lovers spent on the boat, prosecutor Charles Ward-Jackson told the court: ‘Natasha Elderfield had on a short dress and for a while she also had on stockings and they were getting affectionate and were on the point of having sexual contact. ‘She had spent a very pleasurable evening with her new lover Mr Steggles – drinking, dancing, the promise of sex – and it was being interrupted by her very irritating ex-partner and she was fed up of it. ‘That is the background against which Mr Dobinson arrived.’ After storming back to the boat, moored where the couple lived in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, Mr Dobinson went below deck to find his girlfriend and her lover in a tryst. The scene of the alleged murder on the banks of the River Thames in Abingdon, Oxfordshire . Mr Ward-Jackson told the jury: ‘It is likely that Mr Dobinson knew or suspected about this affair and not surprisingly resented it. ‘Within a short space of time Mr Dobinson arrived on the boat. Natasha Elderfield and Mr Steggles were down in the cabin and were about to have sex. ‘He had his trousers down when Mr Dobinson came down into the cabin and his arrival must have been extremely unwelcome.’ The court heard a fight broke out, with Elderfield throwing crockery at Mr Dobinson’s head and he in turn hitting her over the head with a fire extinguisher. The jury heard she then chased him out of the cabin armed with a 4.5in kitchen knife and stabbed him through the heart. ‘She returned to the boat, still holding the knife in an overhand grip, and told Mr Steggles: ‘I’ve stabbed the bastard.’ Elderfield, who told police that Mr Dobinson had accidentally walked on to the knife during a heated argument, denies murder. The trial continues. Police cordoned off a large section of the river bank after Mr Dobinson was found with fatal stab wounds . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."
"A prank video featuring a young girls dressed up as a vampire scaring late-night wanderers in a park in southern Ukraine is spreading on social media. The video, filmed in Moon Park, Odessa, sees film-makers hide in the bushes while the 'vampire girl' preys on unsuspecting passers-by. The young girl dressed in a white, bloodstained nightgown, waits until concerned locals walk up towards her before screaming, causing them to run off in terror. Pranked: The video sees a 'vampire girl' prey on unsuspecting late-night walkers in Odessa, Ukraine . In other scenes she spotted singing a hauntingly horrifying melody, feasting on a fake carcass or chasing her 'victims' through the park holding a blood stained teddy bear. After the video went viral, an Odessa television channel tracked down some of the victims seen running for the hills in the clip. Alexandr Gvozdikov, 21, said: 'I almost wet myself when I saw her. I was riding an expensive bicycle, but I dropped it and ran off like a madman. 'She was so real, she was my worst nightmare. 'It was not funny at all, and it is not OK to prank people like that.' Scary success: The video showing the 'vampire prank' has gone viral on social media . Friendly face? The young girl was painted like a demonic 'vampire' and wore a bloody nightgown . Scary: The vampire girl hides her bloody make up as a man walks up to her, appearing concerned . The man behind the prank video Andrey Yakubovich, told local media: 'Nobody has ever done anything like this before in the Ukraine, and it was our first scary prank video. 'We were very curious what the reaction from the passers-by would be.' However, despite the video's viral success, not all the commentators have been amused. One person pointed out that they film-makers had been lucky that nobody turned violent and punched the child. Another said that somebody with a weak heart might not have survived the scare . In one scene, the girl can be seen chasing her 'victims' through the park holding a blood stained teddy bear . Not what it seem: While sitting down with her head bowed, the little girl looks lost and not slightly scary ."
"Frankie Dettori made it six winners in four days as well as three flying dismounts with a treble at Newbury on Saturday centred around a neck success on Charlie Hills-trained Greenham Stakes winner Muhaarar. Spring has sprung this week and Dettori has been bouncing higher than Tigger. In this sort of form, those who suggested his best days were well behind him will have to eat their words. Frankie Dettori leaps from his mount  after riding Muhaarar to win The AON Greenham Stakes at Newbury . Dettori rides Mr Singh to win The Al Basti Equiworld Maiden Stakes at Newbury racecourse . Thursday’s announcement that Dettori’s boss Sheik Joaan Al Thani had signed up Gregory Benoist to ride the French-based horses in his expanding string, means the 44-year-old Italian can concentrate on Britain. That means less tiring criss-crossing of the Channel for Dettori as well as having another positive spin-off – being available for rides going spare with old boss John Gosden after winter staffing rehuffles. So far, Dettori has been mopping them up. Three of the jockey’s winners – Derby prospect Golden Horn, who won the Feilden Stakes at Newmarket, Oaks candidate Star of Seville, who scored at Newbury on Friday, plus maiden winner Mr Singh on Saturday were all prepared for action by Gosden. Dettori said: ‘The Greenham was good. They went very fast and Muhaarar is a horse that needs to settle. He did and produced. ‘I don’t think I have had thee flying dismounts before so early. I have had a fantastic week. It is brilliant and being back at John’s – I have gone full circle. I am back to where I started.’ Dettori riding Muhaarar to victory in the The AON Greenham Stakes at Newbury on Saturday . Dettori had spoken of his enthusiasm for the season ahead when unveiled as the new ambassador for his home course Newmarket last week. He showed that on tricky Ayaar, 7-1 Luca Cumani-trained winner of Newbury’s Spring Cup. He now has nine winners from 29 rides, not sound seismic but it is significant compared to the last two seasons. The 2014 campaign had only 37 successes and, a truncated 2013 season when he returned from the doldrums of splitting from Godolphin and a six-month cocaine ban had him walking around like yesterday’s man. Dettori riding Ayaar win The Be Wiser Insurance Spring Cup at Newbury racecourse on Saturday . He is no longer champion jockey material but he does look to have significant better chances of good rides in quality races. His 1,000 Guineas ride will be Richard Hannon-trained Nell Gwyn Stakes winner Osaila, who runs for Sheik Joaan, while he must pick from Hannon-trained Craven Stakes third Moheet and John Quinn’s Group One winning two-year-old The Wow Factor in the 2,000. Hannon has insisted both Greenham Stakes second and third Istidhkaar and Ivawood will join his Craven Stakes winner Kool Kompany in the 2,000 Guineas. He also might still run Tiggy Wiggy, runner-up to Ralph Beckett’s Redstart in the Fred Darling Stakes Saturday, in the 1,000 Guineas. But after a disappointing show, some bookmakers have taken her out of the ante-post betting."
"Thousands of protesters took to the streets to call for Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi to resign.
Mr Sisi has faced heavy criticism over his executive decision to give away the Red Sea islands, during a visit by Saudi Arabia's King Salman.
The uninhabited islands have been under Egyptian control since 1950.
The protesters in Cairo chanted ""Sisi out"" and ""We own the land"".
Mohamed Hussein, an engineer, told Reuters: ""I'm protesting because of the overall situation in the country, not just the islands.""
Some also chanted ""The people want the downfall of the regime!"" - a slogan from the 2011 Arab Spring uprising that toppled former leader Hosni Mubarak - as well as ""Sisi - Mubarak"".
At least 80 people were arrested in Cairo and Alexandria, officials said.
The White House said the US would watch the situation in Egypt, a key ally, carefully.
Both secular and Islamist activists had called for people to demonstrate against the transfer of the uninhabited islands.
Mr Sisi was forced to publicly defend his decision to give away the islands, Tiran and Sanafir, which are situated at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba.
He said they had always belonged to the Saudis and Egypt had simply been asked to look after them.
""We did not surrender our rights but we restored the rights of others,"" Mr Sisi said. ""Egypt did not relinquish even a grain of sand. All the data and documents say nothing except that this particular right is theirs.""
Critics of the deal say Mr Sisi's decision to hand over the islands without parliamentary approval, and only announce the deal after it was done, was improper.
Others have accused the president of giving the islands away in return for Saudi aid and investment.
Mr Sisi has faced increasing criticism in recent months on a range of issues, including Egypt's lacklustre economy.
The president, a former army general, previously enjoyed broad support after winning the election in 2014, but has faced a backlash in recent months."
"Hodor hodor hodor. Hodor hodor? Hodor. Hodor-hodor. Hodor! While this sentence might puzzle many, fans of the hit HBO show Game of Thrones, the fifth season of which had its US premiere last night, will understand the reference. Hodor is the brawny, simple-minded stableboy of the Stark family in Winterfell. His defining characteristic, of course, is that he only speaks a single word: 'Hodor.' Hodor, a character in Game of Thrones, earned his name because he says only the word 'Hodor' over and over again. He may have expressive aphasia, according to Jordan Lewis, of Penn State Medical School . But those who read the A Song of Ice and Fire book series by George R R Martin may know something that the TV fans don't: his name isn't actually Hodor. According to his great-grandmother Old Nan, his real name is Walder. 'No one knew where 'Hodor' had come from,' she says, 'but when he started saying it, they started calling him by it. It was the only word he had.' Whether he intended it or not, Martin created a character who is a textbook example of someone with a neurological condition called expressive aphasia. LOSING THE ABILITY TO SPEAK . In 1861, French physician Paul Broca was introduced to a man named Louis-Victor Leborgne. While his comprehension and mental functioning remained relatively normal, Mr Leborgne progressively lost the ability to produce meaningful speech over a period of 20 years. Like Hodor, the man was nicknamed Tan because he only spoke a single word: 'Tan.' Just a few days after meeting Dr Broca, Leborgne passed away. Dr Broca's autopsy determined tissue damage, or a 'lesion', in the frontal lobe of Mr Leborgne's left brain hemisphere, just next to a brain fold called the lateral sulcus. In 1861, a French physician called Dr Broca found a particular part of the brain is involved in language. It became known as Broca's area (pictured  in red). Damage to Broca's area causes language problems . Over the next two years, Dr Broca acquired brains from 12 more patients with Mr Leborgne's symptoms – all of the autopsy evidence was strikingly consistent. Neuroscientists are still examining this small region of the brain, now often referred to as 'Broca's area' to work out its many functions. Most research has focused on a patient's inability to form syntactically complex sentences when this area is damaged. More recent work using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has also reported that Broca's area is active during language comprehension tasks, interpretation of movement and comprehending various gestures also associated with speech, such as waving goodbye. HOW BRAIN DAMAGE AFFECTS SPEECH . In collaboration with French scientists in 2007, a group at the University of California revisited the brains of Mr Leborgne and Mr Lelong (another of Mr Broca's patients who could only speak five words) using MRI scans. One of their most interesting findings was that their lesions extended much deeper than Broca had reported, suggesting that multiple brain regions were probably contributing to their speech deficits. This evidence of widespread damage is unsurprising. Mr Leborgne, Mr Lelong – and even Hodor – are actually more extreme examples of individuals with expressive aphasia. The new series of Game of Thrones, featuring Hodor, played by Kristian Nairns, aired yesterday . More commonly, a person with the disorder will express themselves in 'telegraphic speech', which usually comprises three or so words, including a noun and a verb. For example, someone may say, 'Anne, dog, walk' to mean 'I walked the dog with Anne today.' The most common cause of expressive aphasia is stroke, which occurs when a blood clot blocks a vessel in the brain, resulting in tissue damage due to lack of oxygen. It's estimated that expressive aphasia occurs in 12 per cent of stroke patients, while roughly 35 per cent of stroke patients suffer from a language aphasia of some form. Expressive aphasia can also be caused by a tumour, haemorrhage, a haematoma in the membrane covering of the brain, or trauma to the head. It has been reported that Mr Leborgne suffered from epileptic seizures as a child – some have speculated that he may have experienced head trauma during one such episode. So what's Hodor's story? Did he sustain a blow to the head, suffer a stroke, or was he simply a giant baby dropped by his mother? He may only speak one word, but like the other characters in the show, Hodor too may have a quite an interesting backstory."
"The hashtag #KamiTidakTakut has emerged in the aftermath of Thursday's attacks.
A common meme, of a peace sign with a Jakarta landmark in its centre, was adapted from an image used on social media after the Paris attacks.
Where the Eiffel Tower stood in the Paris version, this shows Indonesia's National Monument.
It stands in the centre of Jakarta as a symbol of the country's struggle for independence. It is a famous landmark and popular meeting point in the city.
A photograph that appeared to show a satay seller continuing to work at his stall after blasts were heard was circulated widely online.
Some Twitter users wrote alongside it: ""Fear is not in our dictionary.""
The photograph was first uploaded to a local social media site, with a comment saying the stall was 100m away from the site of the bombs, which had happened two hours earlier.
The satay seller has since been interviewed by Indonesian media.
Another popular hashtag was #JakartaBerani, which can be translated as ""Jakarta is Brave"".
Soon after reports started to filter through on Thursday morning (local time) that explosions had been heard, Twitter users started to use the hashtag #PrayforJakarta. It is not a new hashtag. It had previously been used in cases of severe flooding, but was used again as people from Indonesia and around the world shared their sympathy for the city.
Aulia Masna, a technology blogger in Jakarta, said the morning's events had shown Indonesians used Twitter as much as ever for updates.
He tweeted that ""everyone flocks to Twitter"", and the microblogging site was not being ""abandoned"" by Indonesians as some had said."
"Beaten FA Cup semi-finalists Reading lost again as they were defeated by Birmingham in a scrappy Sky Bet Championship game at the Madejski Stadium on Wednesday night. Although Reading dominated most of the match, they wasted several chances in the closing stages of the first half. Birmingham held firm and grabbed the winner seven minutes from the end, when Clayton Donaldson nodded in his 16th goal of the season. Clayton Donaldson (left) scored a late headed winner for Birmingham City as his side defeated Reading 1-0 . Donaldson, who signed from Brentford in the summer, scored his 16th goal of the season . READING: Federici, Gunter, Cooper, Hector, Ake, McCleary (Appiah 63), Karacan, Chalobah, Obita, Mackie (Stacey 63), Blackman (Novakovich 81) Subs not used: Kelly, Norwood, Akpan, Andersen . Booked: Obita . BIRMINGHAM CITY: Randolph, Spector, Morrison, Kiernan, Caddis (Dyer 62), Tesche, Gleeson, Fabbrini (Shinnie 34), Grounds, Donaldson, Thomas (Gray 77) Subs not used: Cotterill, Novak, Doyle, Davis . Referee: Lee Mason . Attendance: 14,604 . Reading were involved in a dramatic 2-1 defeat against Arsenal, after extra-time, in the last four of the Cup at Wembley on Saturday. Goalkeeper Adam Federici, whose fumble led to Alexis Sanchez's winning goal, was retained against Birmingham - as were six of his fellow starters from Wembley. At least Reading had no pressure on them, the last lingering doubts of relegation having been removed when Millwall lost 2-0 at Blackburn Rovers on Tuesday night. Birmingham had little to play for either, apart from trying to improve on a poor recent record of just two wins in eight league matches. A predictably dour opening, with neither side keen to force the pace, ended when Wes Thomas aimed at Federici. But it was a weak effort that did not trouble the Australian goalkeeper. Reading, with only two wins in 13 league games behind them and no wins in six, responded swiftly as the game warmed up. Garath McCleary, scorer of Reading's equaliser against Arsenal, fired wide after a long pass from Jake Cooper. A Cooper header lacked the power to test Birmingham keeper Darren Randolph, Jamie Mackie shot wide after Jem Karacan had been blocked out, and Mackie and Nick Blackman had close-range efforts cleared to safety. Randolph made a flying save to keep out a fierce McCleary shot and the keeper also had to stop two decent long-range attempts from Nathaniel Chalobah. Reading fans showed their support for Adam Federci following his blunder at Wembley on Saturday . Donaldson goes one-on-one with Federici, who was hoping to make amends for his mistake against Arsenal . Birmingham threatened only rarely, Paul Caddis blazing over from a Diego Fabbrini cross, which Donaldson had missed, and Jonathan Grounds heading straight at Federici from a Caddis corner. Reading kept up the momentum after the interval but, as Birmingham defended stubbornly, the home side spoiled good approach work with poor final touches. Nathan Ake did manage to fashion a chance when wriggling clear of his markers but drove straight at Randolph. Reading lost their second game in as many matches as their poor Championship form continues . Birmingham continued to sit back, inviting the pressure. Jordan Obita missed with a powerful drive and then drilled over a low cross that no team-mate was able to reach. Andrew Shinnie was off target from distance but Reading regained the upper hand with efforts from Chalobah, a 20-yard shot saved by Randolph, substitute Jack Stacey and Ake. Birmingham rallied late on, with Federici having to make two smart saves to deny substitute Demarai Gray. And the visitors broke the deadlock in the 83rd minute. Stephen Gleeson delivered a corner from the left and Donaldson rose unchallenged to glance a header past the helpless Federici."
"A woman whose designer crocodile-skin handbag was seized by the UK Border Force has triumphed in a test case bid to get it back. The £2,000 designer tote bag, hand-made in Japan, was a 50th birthday gift for Hampstead woman, Sabine Smouha, from her husband Jeremy, the director of an investments company. But, when it arrived in Britain in 2013, customs officers confiscated it because Nile crocodiles are a protected species and it didn't have the right documentation. High end: A £2,000 designer tote bag, hand-made from Nile crocodile skinin Japan by exclusive designer Hikiji . The Border Force has repeatedly refused to return it to her, because it it did not have the required endangered species import permit. Now, however, Mrs Smouha - who said she was 'very sad to lose her birthday present' - has been handed victory by a tribunal judge. Judge Anne Redston said the crocodile was farmed and Mrs Smouha had relied on the reputable Japanese manufacturer to get the formalities right. She had acted entirely honestly and the Border Force's repeated refusal to hand over the bag was irrational and disproportionate. The judge said Mrs Smouha's birthday was approaching and her husband wanted to buy her a special present. She spotted the 'very pretty bag' on the website of elite Japanese handbag maker, Hikiji. The black bag, complete with bronze cowhide lining and matt gold finishings, was the creation of top designer, Mayumi Kondo. Her husband paid $3,400 for it and it arrived in the UK by express mail, in time for Mrs Smouha's happy day. Sabine Smouha was handed a victory at the Royal Courts of Justice, left, after a two-year battle. Judge Anne Redston ordered UK Border Force to reconsider their ruling on a designer handbag made from Nile crocodile, right, that they confiscated on the grounds that it was not imported with the right documentation . The bag was made from the skin of a Nile crocodile, a protected species under the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). But it didn't have the required documentation and customs officials seized it at the international mail hub, in Coventry. Representing herself, Mrs Smouha told the First-Tier Tribunal at the Royal Courts of Justice that she had been told by Hikiji that import formalities would be 'taken care of'. Endangered species are protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Countries all over the world have signed up to the agreement imposing special responsibilities on anyone importing any of the hundreds of plant and animal species listed in the convention . It's designed to stop the illegal killing of these species by destroying the market. It applies to anything from that species, such as skin, fur and teeth . Under British and EU law, you must apply to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for a permit before importing anything on the list . When something is imported, it must also have a permit proving it was sourced legally by the country of export . Without these documents, your items can be confiscated by customs officials - but you have the right to appeal . There is also other international legislation applying to the trade of endangered species. Some can impose fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars and carry jail terms . It was the first time that the Japanese company had exported to the UK, but she was unaware of that. The crocodile skin, which had been farmed 'in a controlled environment' in Zambia, was legally imported into Japan before being re-exported. Judge Redston said: 'She was very sad to lose her birthday present and had done everything she could to remedy the position'. She had even offered to 'pay a reasonable fine' so long as the bag was returned to her. Ruling in Mrs Smouha's favour, Judge Redston said the Border Force had failed to consider the individual facts of her case. The skin had not been smuggled into the UK in defiance of CITES and Mrs Smouha had 'reasonably relied' upon Hikiji, whose duty it was to obtain an import permit. The judge added: 'Mrs Smouha did not ignore CITES. She communicated with Hikiji and understood that CITES had been complied with. 'She is not in business and the bag was a birthday present. This was her first experience of CITES. 'The bag cost $3,400 and she did everything she could to rectify the position after she realised the mistake. 'Mrs Smouha acted honestly and in good faith throughout'. Judge Redston gave the Border Force six weeks to reach a fresh decision in the light of her ruling."
"Mark Bellamy, president of the Intensive Care Society, told the BBC the problem of resistance would get worse unless new and effective antibiotics were developed.
Sepsis is triggered by infections and causes around 37,000 deaths a year in the UK.
NHS England says hospitals should work together to tackle the problem.
Sepsis usually develops from blood poisoning and involves a dramatic reaction by the body's immune system.
If not treated quickly it can lead to organ failure or death.
Early symptoms can include a high temperature and a fast heartbeat.
The Intensive Care Society recently launched a campaign to raise awareness of sepsis to avoid what it says are thousands of preventable deaths.
There are 37,000 deaths a year in the UK because of sepsis, compared with just more than 35,000 from lung cancer and 16,000 from bowel cancer.
The society, along with the UK Sepsis Trust, argues that there is inadequate recording of sepsis cases by hospitals and insufficient knowledge of the steps required to recognise and treat it early.
Julie Bignone nearly died because of sepsis and spent seven weeks in hospital - some of them in a critical condition.
Feeling feverish, she assumed she had a bad dose of flu. After a weekend in bed, she went to her GP and was told to come back if her condition worsened and antibiotics would be prescribed.
But later that day, with her family growing more anxious she was taken to hospital by ambulance.
Julie was found to have pneumonia in both lungs and sepsis and doctors feared she might not survive.
She only pulled through after several weeks in intensive care and heavy doses of antibiotics.
She feels now that she should have acted on her instinct early on that she was suffering from something a lot worse than flu.
Julie says: ""There's a lot of scope for getting it wrong with sepsis because the symptoms are not specific enough - we need to get a system where doctors listen to patients more and allow them to have more of an opinion"".
Prof Bellamy, who is based at the Leeds Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, said:  ""For the first time this year I have had a couple patients for whom we had no effective antibiotic treatment, it's rare - but two years ago it would still have been regarded as a theoretical problem.""
He says it is crucial to raise the profile of sepsis, and to ensure it is tackled early to give the patient the best chance of survival.
The diminishing impact of antibiotics, in his view, underlines the urgency of the task.
He said there was a ""spectre emerging of moving into a post-antibiotic era"".
NHS England has acknowledged the scale of the problem.
Bruce Warner, its deputy director of patient safety, said: ""We know there are many preventable deaths due to sepsis each year and our top priority has to be saving those lives we can save and having as big an impact as we can.""
NHS England wants to encourage greater co-ordination within hospitals to ensure sepsis is diagnosed and treated quickly.
It cited Nottingham University Hospitals Trust, which has been praised for use of laptops by staff to record patient data and symptoms and ensure they are analysed quickly by clinicians."
"A British university student has been ordered out of Russia amid claims she is a spy. History postgraduate Laura Sumner, 24, was given ten days to leave the country after being fined £23.50 for an alleged visa violation. But Russian media reports have branded her ‘Agent Sumner’ and linked her to a bizarre claim of a revolutionary plot. Laura Mary Sumner, pictured, has been ordered to leave Russia within ten days after being branded a 'spy' A pro-Kremlin website claimed she was one of a number of students carrying out research in Russia by British historian, Professor Sarah Badcock. The report claimed the Nottingham University academic’s work was ‘important for the plans of the West to create a “colour revolution” in Russia’. The term describes the overthrow of governments in former Soviet states, such as the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine. Professor Badcock, 40, is supervising Miss Sumner’s PhD thesis on early Soviet Russia but there has been no suggestion outside Russian media that either woman is involved in espionage or plans to foment revolution. Russian authorities accused her of conducting research in the country without the appropriate visa . Ms Sumner, left, was researching Soviet rule from 1917 to 1921 as part of her PhD under Professor Sarah Badcock of Nottingham University, right, who is acknowledged as one of Britain's leading Russian experts . Questions have been raised over whether Miss Sumner has fallen victim to a tit-for-tat punishment by Russia. It came on the day that it emerged Britain had granted political asylum to a wealthy supporter of a prominent Russian opposition leader called Vladimir Ashurkov, who has been accused of embezzlement. And diplomatic relations have remained tense following Britain’s decision to launch a public inquiry into the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko in London. Action was taken against Miss Sumner by the Federal Migration Service but sources claimed officers from the FSB, the successor to the feared KGB, were in the courtroom. Federal Judge Ilya Varlamov, pictured, ordered that Ms Sumner must leave the country within 10 days . Ms Sumner, left, appeared in court along with an interpreter, right, and was ordered to pay a £23.50 fine . A migration service spokesman said the hearing on Wednesday April 1 in the city of Nizhny Novgorod was ‘not an April Fool joke’. Nottingham University said Miss Sumner appeared to have fallen foul of a ‘minor infringement in visa regulations’ but did not respond to the spying claims. She has been offered consular support by the British Embassy. Miss Sumner, from Solihull, describes herself as a feminist and dog lover on Twitter, and has been working on her thesis for more than a year. She has been to Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod at least twice to carry out research. She was unavailable for comment and her Twitter account had been deleted yesterday. Professor Badcock was also unavailable and was said to be on holiday with her family."
"The Football Association will be contacting QPR and Chelsea after an incident which saw Branislav Ivanovic struck on the head by a cigarette lighter thrown from a section of home supporters at Loftus Road. QPR are unlikely to face disciplinary action over the incident which happened as Chelsea players celebrated the winning goal in Sunday's 1-0 victory. It is understood however that the FA will seek observations from each club and will ensure that QPR and the police are taking the necessary steps to identify the culprit via CCTV and for them to face a banning order. Jubilant Chelsea celebrations were marred by objects being thrown onto the pitch by the crowd . During the Chelsea celebrations at Loftus Road, the Blues were targeted by objects thrown from the crowd . QPR are reviewing CCTV footage and have promised to ban those involved.

The sale was announced by administrators from FRP Advisory.
The Grade B listed building consists of 161 rooms and has planning permission for a 20-bedroom extension at the rear of the property.
FRP said it was continuing to operate two other hotels in Aberdeen which were also placed under administration following EDC's collapse.
The Holiday Inn in Westhill and Holiday Inn Express on Chapel Street will be placed on the market ""shortly"", the administrators said.
Joint administrator Iain Fraser added: ""Trade has been firm over the festive period and the administration of EDC represents a rare opportunity to acquire quality hotels in Aberdeen in busy locations.
""We would therefore encourage interested parties to contact the Aberdeen office of FRP Advisory as soon as possible."""
"Jose Mourinho's side had applied incessant pressure on the Foxes from kick-off, and Romelu Lukaku missed a second-half penalty prior to the goals, as they found it difficult to break the steadfast backline.
I think we frustrated them for large parts of the game
They finally breached the last line of defence when Rashford converted Henrikh Mkhitaryan's corner three minutes after coming on.
And then midfielder Fellaini stuck out his knee to divert fellow substitute Jesse Lingard's drive past Kasper Schmeichel.
United are the only side to have won all three of their opening league games this season and have yet to concede a goal.
United peppered the opposition area with crosses in the first half, but aside from a Paul Pogba strike that drifted narrowly wide, the threat from the wings was comfortably dealt with by the Foxes' defensive giants Wes Morgan and Harry Maguire.
There was a shift in manager Mourinho's thinking in the second half as his side began to breach the 18-yard area with shorter balls from a more central position.
That probing should have resulted in the opening goal. Leicester were once again on the back foot in their area before Anthony Martial struck a shot that came off Danny Simpson's arm. Referee Michael Oliver declared it to be deliberate handball.
...plus reaction & video here
Lukaku stepped up to the spot, but his hopes of a fourth league goal this season were thwarted by Schmeichel's dive to the right.
Leicester continued to come under pressure and eventually succumbed when Rashford's instinctive shot flew past the Dane in goal in the 70th minute.
Holes now began to appear in Leicester's previously watertight defence as they went looking for an equaliser.
United capitalised again as substitute Lingard's low drive was diverted into the net by Fellaini, although replays suggested the Belgian was fractionally offside.
Leicester manager Craig Shakespeare should not be too despondent.
His side's valiant defensive display was reminiscent of those during the Premier League-winning campaign two seasons ago. It was at the other end that his men disappointed.
At Old Trafford, both Jamie Vardy - the Foxes' star striker of 2015-16 - and Shinji Okazaki were ineffective, while Riyad Mahrez teased the United defence without an end product.
Vardy was withdrawn with 15 minutes left, to be replaced by Islam Slimani.
The closest Leicester came to scoring was when substitute Andy King forced a brilliant point-blank save from David de Gea in the final few seconds of the match.

Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho on winning the first three matches: ""We can look into perspective. Last season we won against Leicester at home so that doesn't make a difference, but we had too many draws at home last season.
""The difference is the quality of our football, we're playing better today. If we hadn't won this match I wouldn't have anyone to blame.
The team is playing very well and I'm very confident. We are comfortable on the ball and dangerous on the counter-attack. But nine points after three matches is nothing different for us, because we did that last season.

Leicester boss Craig Shakespeare: ""I think we frustrated them for large parts of the game. When you come to Old Trafford in the form they are in, they will have big moments. We had our moments too, but could not see the game through.
""Set-pieces are our Achilles heel at the moment. We need to organise better.
""It was a harsh penalty, but a great save form Schmeichel. To go 1-0 down, it knocked a bit of spirit from us. I'm disappointed in the overall result, but we were nice and solid for large parts.
""You have to be disciplined; you know what the opposition's strengths are. We tried to attack in the second half.
""Maguire was carrying a knock but was desperate to play - he was solid.""

"A BBC Freedom of Information request revealed 27 completed inquiries have resulted in potential disciplinary action against up to 15 officers.
Eighteen forces are the subject of complaints about the handling of abuse.
These include what the IPCC has called potential ""high-level corruption"".
Of the investigations, 56 cases relate to alleged failures by South Yorkshire Police in responding to child sexual exploitation in Rotherham; 46 follow allegations against the Metropolitan Police, and 58 against Essex Police.
Julian Blazeby, the IPCC's director of major investigations, said: ""We continue to receive referrals on police actions in child sexual abuse cases from forces across the country.
""The IPCC is committed to investigating the most sensitive and serious incidents of alleged police wrongdoing and many child sexual abuse cases fall within that remit.""
Some of the cases date back decades and include damaging claims that investigations were brought to a halt despite evidence of abuse being uncovered.
In Rotherham, the 2014 report by Professor Alexis Jay revealed police suppressed evidence of the widespread sexual abuse of teenagers and failed to arrest the abusers.
In London, allegations also centre on investigations being halted and evidence suppressed.
They include claims that investigations were shut down prematurely or prosecutions not pursued because the suspects were politicians.
However, in May 2016 one claim - that a prosecution was stopped when a defendant threatened to name the former prime minister, Sir Edward Heath, as an abuser - was dismissed by the IPCC.
The suggestion that the powerful have been protected by the police is far from being proven.
The current allegations span 17 English police forces and one in Wales.
There are 84 independent IPCC inquiries - in which the commission directly investigates - under way, into:
There are 102 managed inquiries, in which the IPCC oversees internal police investigations, in four forces:
There is one supervised case, in which IPCC managers monitor the internal police investigation, taking place at Norfolk Police.
The 27 completed cases have resulted in disciplinary action against two officers and disciplinary proceedings against 13 more.
The IPCC says it is liaising closely with the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse and Operation Hydrant, the police team co-ordinating child abuse investigations.
In an attempt to handle the increase in complex inquiries, the commission has created a new directorate of major investigations.
The National Police Chiefs' Council lead for child protection, Chief Constable Simon Bailey, said the police service has ""risen to the challenge"" in changing the way it engages with victims and how it investigates abuse.
But he added: ""Although we have improved our response, there is still more to do.  If there is concern that a victim hasn't received a full and impartial investigation into their allegations this should be referred to the force or IPCC to be scrutinised."""
"The Duchess of Cambridge's sister took civil court action against a ""person or persons unknown"" after her account was said to have been hacked.
The Sun reported it was offered the images, which included shots of Prince George and Princess Charlotte.
A 35-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of an offence under the Computer Misuse Act and later bailed.
The allegations emerged after private pictures were said to have been offered to the newspaper via encrypted messaging service WhatsApp.
The Sun said it had been approached by someone using a pseudonym and asking for Â£50,000 within 48 hours.
Barrister Adam Wolanski, who led Miss Middleton's legal team, said she thought there had been a ""genuine hack"".
He said it was a ""flagrant"" and ""criminal"" act which had caused Miss Middleton ""considerable distress"".
Police said they were investigating the allegations and a 35-year-old man had been released on police bail pending further inquiries. He was arrested at an address in Northamptonshire late on Saturday.
In the summer, Miss Middleton and hedge fund manager James Matthews confirmed their engagement, with a wedding planned for next year.
Several high-profile figures have had images stolen from their iCloud accounts, including actress Jennifer Lawrence and singer Rihanna.
In July, American Edward Majerczyk pleaded guilty to running a phishing campaign to steal private pictures and videos from film and TV stars, in what was known as the ""celebgate"" affair."
"The family of Valentina Milluzzo said the doctor treating her refused to abort the foetuses because he was a ""conscientious objector"" to abortion.
The hospital involved has categorically rejected the family's claims.
The woman's burial has been postponed while further investigations are carried out.
Milluzzo was admitted to Cannizzaro hospital in the Sicilian city of Catania on 29 September after suffering complications and going into premature labour in her 19th week of pregnancy. She had had fertility treatment at another health centre.
She was in a stable condition in hospital for more than a fortnight but on 15 October her blood pressure and temperature dropped and her condition worsened.
According to the family's lawyer, one of the foetuses was suffering breathing problems. The lawyer alleges that the gynaecologist refused to abort the foetuses in order to save the mother and said: ""As long as it's alive, I will not intervene.""
No action was taken while the troubled foetus was still alive and hours later both had died, the lawyer said.
Overnight, the mother's condition deteriorated and she contracted an infection. On 16 October she was transferred to intensive care, where she died.
Angelo Pellicano, the head of the Cannizzaro hospital, said the lawyer was wrong.
""There was no conscientious objection on behalf of the doctor that intervened in this case because there was no voluntary termination of the pregnancy, but (the miscarriage) was forced by the grave circumstances,"" he told the Ansa news agency. ""I rule out that a doctor could have told the family what they say he told them.""
Sources told Ansa that the doctor had not been registered as a ""conscientious objector"".
Catania's prosecutor has halted Milluzzo's burial while a post mortem examination is carried out. There are unconfirmed reports that some of the hospital's medical staff may be investigated.
A senior doctor at the hospital, Paolo Scollo, told the Corriere website that all the doctors in his department were ""objectors"", and external doctors were called in when necessary. ""However, in this case we're talking about a spontaneous miscarriage, no external help was needed. So we do not think the doctor was negligent,"" he said.
It emerged earlier this year that the proportion of Italian gynaecologists refusing to carry out abortions in 2013 was 70%, according to Italian government figures. Italy is a predominantly Catholic country.
But in southern Italy the proportion was even higher and in Sicily it was 87.6%.
Abortion has been legal in Italy since 1978, provided it is during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
After 12 weeks it is allowed only if the life of the mother is at risk or there is a problem with a foetus.
If there is a chance the foetus can survive outside the womb, termination is lawful only if pregnancy or delivery is a serious risk to the woman's health.

"Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been seriously injured in an air strike and is no longer in control of the terrorist group, according to an Iraqi source. The source said that he was wounded by an attack from the US-led coalition while travelling in a three-car convoy in March in Nineveh, Iraq. At first his chances of survival were deemed by his lieutenants to be low, but he pulled through. Scroll down for video . Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) has been seriously injured in an air strike and is no longer in control of the terrorists, according to an Iraqi source . However, he was left so weakened that his inner circle reportedly mooted the idea of naming a new leader. He is slowly recovering but does not have the reins of the organisation, according to The Guardian. Two officials confirmed to the paper that the strike on the convoy did indeed take place, on March 18 in the al-Baaj district of Nineveh, not far from the Syrian border. One, a Western diplomat, told the paper that Coalition generals weren’t sure whether al-Baghdadi was in the convoy. News of the attack follows contradictory accounts of al-Baghdadi being killed in air strikes in November and December . Another, an Iraqi expert on Isis used by the government in Baghdad in an advisory capacity, revealed that he had in fact been wounded. He said: ‘Yes, he was wounded in al-Baaj near the village of Umm al-Rous on 18 March with a group that was with him.’ This area is known to be largely lawless and a hotbed of jihadi activity, with very little Coalition air presence. Raffaello Pantucci, Director of International Security Studies for defence think tank the Royal United Services Institute, told MailOnline that it’s entirely plausible that the infamous leader had been hit, but warned that it might not have a long-term impact on the group if he didn't survive. He said: ‘We’ve heard these stories before. It's possible, as they would be going after him and they would be trying to drone him, but it’s right to be suspicious. 'If he was killed it would have a big effect on the group as a lot of the group is wrapped up in his identity. The whole of Islamic State is built on success and if the leader is bumped off it’s harder to say you’re winning. ‘But it’s quite a resilient group. They would do a PR piece on it and say he’s gone to a better place – but coherence often comes from leadership. ‘However, it would not mean the end of the group by any stretch.’ Last year there were two reports that Baghdadi had been wounded, but they turned out to be inaccurate. He escaped death in December when US jets attacked a two-car convoy on the outskirts of Mosul. His close aide Auf Abdul Rahman al-Efery was killed when a rocket fired from a war plane hit one of the cars. Baghdadi was believed to be in the second car, which was not hit. Figures from February showed allied airstrikes, including those carried out by British warplanes, had killed more than 6,000 fighters since September. The figure included more than half of the militants on the IS ruling council. Among the dead jihadists was also Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, a former Iraqi army lieutenant colonel considered Baghdadi’s number two and the most senior IS militant in Iraq. His death and that of as many as nine others on the 18-man leadership council forced Baghdadi to promote local warlords to the status of regional commanders, as his inner circle of trusted advisers and battle-hardened loyalists became increasingly small. Baghdadi, 43, was the head of al-Qaeda in Iraq before founding the Islamic State in Iraq in 2010, while he was declared head of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in 2013. In June last year, the Islamic State declared itself a caliphate, with al-Baghdadi declared as its ‘Caliph’ or ruler."
"England have finally arrived home from Turin after their delayed flight landed at Manchester Airport following Tuesday night's 1-1 draw with Italy.

"Maj Gen James Johnston was faced with 40,000 prisoners at the Bergen-Belsen camp and set up a hospital to treat them for typhus, TB and starvation.
His son, Anthony Johnston, said: ""He had to deal with people dying by the hundreds every day.""
The plaque was unveiled in Northiam, East Sussex where Gen Johnston lived.
Born in Glasgow, he moved to the village with his family in 1973.
About 60 people, including members of Gen Johnston's family, gathered for the unveiling at the pump house on the village green.
Gen Johnston was commanding a mobile medical unit close to the German-Dutch border in April 1945.
He was ordered to move his unit to take charge of the sick and starving at Bergen-Belsen, which had just been liberated by the British.
Around 70,000 people had died at the camp in northern Germany.
Mr Johnston said his father had been reluctant to talk about his World War Two experiences, due to modesty and wanting to block out such a traumatic event.
""There were times in his life when former inmates, who he had come across at the time, got in touch with him and wanted to acknowledge him,"" Mr Johnston said.
""Other than that, he didn't talk about it.""
In an account which is now in the Holocaust Museum in Washington, Gen Johnston wrote: ""Little did I know that I was about to be faced with the greatest test of my career, with a situation that would remain engraved on my memory for the rest of my days.
""[It] would instil in me a lasting abhorrence not only of those who had perpetrated this crime on humanity, but also of those who had condoned it."""

Jack Duggan's late winner secured a 1-0 victory on Tuesday and set up a third-round tie at Wycombe in January.
Stourbridge had gone out in round two in three of the previous five seasons.
""This has got to be the biggest (achievement) beating a League One side at home,"" Hackett told BBC WM 95.6.
""This is what the FA Cup is about.""
Hackett, who has been in charge of his home-town club since 2004, continued: ""I thought we were outstanding. We certainly didn't get lucky, we were the better team.
""It's one of those special nights and it's a great occasion for everybody connected with the football club.
""Everybody connected with this football club are heroes. I spoke to a gentleman who comes on the coach every week and never misses a game home or away - I told him 'these nights are for you'.
""Hugh (Clark, Stourbridge president) has been here 50 years and experienced some tough times at this football club, so he gets rewarded. We all do.""
Northampton, who are 13th in League One, started the match four divisions and 89 league places above Stourbridge - who began the day eighth in the Northern Premier League - in the English football pyramid.
Manager Rob Page told BBC Radio Northampton: ""The better team won and that hurts me to say that, but credit's got to go to them.
""It's a hard one to take and I'm embarrassed at the minute. We'll take any criticism we get and we deserve every bit we get for this.""
The former Wales international defender added: ""I apologise for that performance, I didn't expect that at all. Stourbridge deserved their victory, we congratulate them and wish them all the best, but we're all hurting."""
"A single bikini-clad woman silhouetted against a spectacular sunset, a tiny figure facing a swirl of stars, a hot spring whose improbably lurid hues seem like something from another planet - these stunning images combine colour and light to capture the wonders of the natural world. Last year Hawaiian-born photographer Dustin Wong, 31, abandoned his job as an engineer to travel the world with only his camera for company. Inspired by ancient Hawaiian beliefs in the sacredness of the landscape, Dustin Wong, 31, has journeyed from the Arctic Circle to Australia, capturing moments where men and women are alone with the power and splendour of the natural world. This single bikini-clad woman stretches her curvaceous body while silhouetted against a spectacular Hawaiian sunset . Faced with the rapid destruction of habitats through pollution and overpopulation, the photographer hopes his images will inspire the viewer with awe at the intricate and diverse world we live in and encourage them to protect the planet. He writes on his website: 'I have a desire to experience the natural world and to let those feelings inspire me. Life on this planet is older than any of us can comprehend, and there is a beauty in that history and power. However, these days our natural spaces are being encroached upon by human development. A man gazes upon a whirl of stars in the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, where the salt-covered land cracks into spectacular patterns . Last year Hawiian-born photographer Dustin Wong, 31, abandoned his job as an engineer to travel the world with only his camera for company . 'Through my images I try to convey a sense of awe of the incredibly intricate and diverse world we share. I want to encourage people to interact and experience nature for themselves. I think this way more people will care about protecting and preserving natural environments.' He started taking photographs 15 years ago before taking it up full time last year. He traveled all over the west coast of the US living out of a van for five months and visited as many national parks as he could. In Queensland Australia, he follows a woman as she ventures into the dark depths of a natural cavern . His journeying in America took in the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, where the land cracks into spectacular patterns, the Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, the third largest hot spring in the world whose bright colours are caused by bacteria, to the Burning Man Festival in Nevada, which culminates in the burning of a wooden effigy. Other pictures show a spectacular Hawaiian sunset reflected in the sand in improbable bright oranges and reds, or a single solitary figure dwarfed by the waterfall surging above him at at Latourell Falls in Oregan. Revellers climb on top of a massive sculpture of the words 'Believe' at the Burning Man Festival in Nevada . For these photographs he also ventured to Australia, following a woman as she explores a cavern in Queensland, and to Norway, where he captures the stunning greens of the Northern Lights, or a firework exploding against a frosty night-time pine forest. Mr Wong takes his photographs using a DSLR camera before transforming them into High Dynamic Range to bring out colour and detail. He then blends the HDR image with the original exposures, creating an image that is 'slightly fantastical yet still rooted in reality'. The Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, is the third largest hot spring in the world. Its bright colours are caused by pigmented bacteria . His images depict people interacting with the environment and enjoying themselves in the outdoors. At first he shunned using people in his images, which he wanted to capture nature at its pristine best, but he later realised a single figure - either a stranger or himself - provides a sense of scale and helps viewers relate more viscerally to the image in front of them. Although he now lives in Seattle in the USA, he credits his Hawaiian upbringing as the driving force behind his vision of the world. A single figure on a Norwegian beach is bathed in green light as he admires the spectacular Northern Light . He adds: 'Born and raised in Hawaii, I learned about the Hawaiian culture, specifically the way the Ancient Hawaiians held the land in reverence. Those teachings instilled in me an understanding that human beings have an intrinsic relationship with the land that should be held in high respect. 'I aim to create a sense of wonder in each of my pieces. I want to recapture the sense of awe and childhood imagination that often gets abandoned along the way to adulthood. I create art where the viewer is free to wallow in the mysteries and unknown of a beautiful landscape.' Standing in the middle of a snow-covered Norwegian pine forest, a couple release a firework, sending orange blazing into the sky . He uses a single figure like this man dwarfed by the water at Latourell Falls, Oregan, USA, to engourage a visceral response in viewers ."
"And, on emerging relatively unscathed from the deep space experiment, what Wu Shiyun thought was that he would very much like a hot bath and some seafood.
He was one of four chosen to live inside the capsule, which was designed to mimic being on another planet.
The experiment looked at how food and air could be used and sustained under controlled conditions.
Using technology inspired by China's Shenzhou spacecraft, the three men and a woman grew 25 types of plants - including wheat and strawberries.
But it was also a chance to see how four individuals - picked from more than 2,000 candidates - could live together in a space no bigger than a netball court.
They also had to adjust to ""Mars time"", which is 39 minutes longer than an earth day.
But it transpires they found one very effective way to relax: Tai Chi.

The aerodrome was created in 1914 by the forerunner to the Royal Air Force.
It was one of several in the south east of England used to defend London from German Zeppelin airship and bomber raids during the conflict.
It ceased being used by the military in 1919 and was returned to agricultural use.
Its buildings remained and, according to English Heritage, is now ""the largest known surviving group of Royal Flying Corps buildings on a WWI aerodrome"".
In recent years the aerodrome was bought by private owners, who have had the buildings restored, and created a museum to tell its role during the war.
In 2010, a war memorial commemorating the 10 pilots of 37 Squadron killed in action during WWI was erected on the former parade ground.
Among the 24 surviving buildings are the officers' mess, accommodation huts, ammunition store, workshops, blacksmiths and mortuary.
On granting the listed status, Mr Penrose said the aerodrome was a ""poignant reminder of the conditions in which they were working"".
""I am listing Stow Maries for its rarity, its architectural interest, its value as a group and also of course for its historical importance as the first line of defence against German air raids,"" he said.
English Heritage chief executive Simon Thurley said: ""The importance of Stow Maries is amplified by the approaching 100th anniversary of the Great War.
""It's in a remarkable state of preservation, full of historic interest and of great educational potential."""
"A dramatic road rage incident between a truck driver and two young men has been caught on camera. The footage, which was taken last Monday in Forrestville in northern Sydney shows a  driver behind the wheel of an AC & S truck tailgating, yelling and flashing his lights aggressively, nearly crashing into the back of a small Subaru car. The incident started on Warringah Road and continued on for 8.5km, with the passenger in the car claiming the truck driver was laughing and even spit on their car. Scroll down for video . A dramatic road rage incident between a truck driver and two young men has been caught on camera . Friends Cameron Rose and Bo Honna were the occupants of the Subaru and said they were perturbed when the truck driver crossed into their lane without using any indication. While Mr Honna was driving the car, his mate Mr Rose was filming the menacing incident on his phone. After Mr Rose put his arm out the window in a gesture to show the truck driver that he was not happy with his action, an onslaught of terror began. First the truck driver drove up right behind the men, almost touching their bumper. Then he began laughing and sticking his head out the window, shouting abuse at the men, beeping his horn and flashing his lights to put them off their driving. According to Mr Honna, the truckie got about two centimetres from the back of his car. The incident, which started on Warringah Road apparently continued for 8.5km until both the car and the truck were forced to stop at a red light.

"An exotic bird in Brazil was recorded making incredible sounds that wouldn’t be out of place on a video game. The Curl-crested Jay, which resides at the Criadouro Onca Pintada breeding centre, is native to South America and is known to be a good mimic of other birds and man-made sounds. With the ever-growing presence of human’s in their natural habitats, the bird is one example of a number of species that have learned to incorporate peculiar everyday sounds into their song. Videoed behind a fence, the bird initially makes a sinister noise like a distorted voice before creating an almost digital sound. Following this the bird makes a noise that sounds like running water before a Space Invaders style tune emerges from it. Discussing the video, companion parrot behavioural expert Greg Glendell spoke with MailOnline about the various theories regarding the function of these sounds. The Curl-crested Jay is native to South America and resides at the Criadouro Onca Pintada breeding centre . ‘Several groups of birds have a lifelong ability to learn to reproduce new sounds; notably parrots, starlings and crows,’ said Mr Glendell. The particular Jay belongs to the Crow/Corvidae family. ‘Some birds may use them to impress a mate or their peers within their flock,’ he added. ‘Most birds using mimicry are highly social species, with a complex vocal repertoire, which includes innate calls and learnt calls. The bird is one example of a number of species that have learned to incorporate peculiar everyday sounds into their song . ‘As social species they use their calls as language. There are often regional dialects within bird groups. So the same species shows differences in its calls across its range.’ Mr Glendell also noted that sometimes captive birds confined to cages use their ability to mimic to relieve their boredom and ensure responses from their owners. The original video was uploaded to YouTube account: Swiatoczamigoski by a Polish-based blogger who has spent some time volunteering at the Brazilian breeding centre.

"The 58-year-old plans to develop a giant aircraft that would put spaceships into orbit, rather than lifting them off from a launch pad.
Other moguls are in the private space race, too, after Nasa this year ended its 30-year space shuttle programme.
Virgin Galactic is working on a commercial space venture which aims to fly passengers into sub-orbit by 2013.
Aerospace pioneer Burt Rutan is a partner on Mr Allen's project, which is called Stratolaunch Systems.
The project is the latest to be led by Silicon Valley tycoons who think they spy a gap in demand opened by the retirement of the US government's space shuttle programme.
While Nasa put rockets into space from a launch pad, the Stratolaunch plan is to launch unmanned rockets from high-flying aircraft, and eventually undertake manned missions too.
The developers said their aircraft could ferry cargo for the commercial satellite industry and the International Space Station.
The giant plane would be powered by six 747 jumbo jet engines and have a wingspan of 385ft (117m), developers said.
It would be wider than the biggest aircraft ever, legendary Hollywood tycoon Howard Hughes' Spruce Goose.
The first test flights are scheduled to begin in 2016.
Mr Allen and Mr Rutan said that preliminary designs for the Stratolaunch aircraft have been put together over the course of 10 years.
Construction has begun on a hangar in California's Mojave Desert, they said.
In 2004 the duo created SpaceShipOne, a sub-orbital rocket that became the first privately financed, manned spaceship.
""When I was growing up, America's space programme was the symbol of aspiration,"" Mr Allen said at a news conference in Seattle.
""For me, the fascination with space never ended. I never stopped dreaming what might be possible.""
Stratolaunch's plane will carry a booster rocket on its belly, to be built by a space company owned by Elon Musk of PayPal, who has already built a successful commercial rocket.
Other technology titans who have made forays into the private space industry include Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com.
British tycoon Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic aims to take passengers into sub-orbital space.
Dropping rockets into space is not a new technique, but can offer more launch flexibility and minimise weather constraints, developers said.
It can also save on rocket fuel.
Orbital Sciences Corp, an older rocket company, has used this method of launching payloads such as unmanned rockets and satellites."
"In the past year solar power in the UK has more than doubled while in the US it has grown by 30 per cent. But many current systems fail to solve the problem of how energy is managed and used overnight when the sun sets. Traditionally, energy gathered during the day is sent back to the grid, but this can prove costly if you need to buy it back - unless you have a smart battery that stores the excess energy in your home. Sonnenspeicher (pictured) uses a lithium iron phosphate battery to store energy harnessed by solar panels. This energy can be used throughout the day, and any excess is stored for when the sun goes down. Rather than selling this excess electricity back to the grid, homeowners can then use their stored supply for power . With this in mind, German firm Automatic Storage Device (ASD) and designer Wolfram Walter have created the Sonnenspeicher. It uses a lithium iron phosphate battery to store the energy harvested during the day by solar panels fitted to a roof. This energy is used throughout the day, and any excess is stored for when the sun goes down. Rather than selling this excess electricity to the grid, and potentially having to buy it back at a later date or time, homeowners can use this stored supply to power their home until the sun rises again. Sonnenspeicher features an intelligent management system that automatically controls the charging and discharging current, to make it easier to manage how much energy is being used.

Although it is designed to be completely independent of the national power grid, it can equally be wired up in the case of emergency.

This switchover works the other way too. If a home is predominantly powered by the grid, the Sonnenspeicher will still store energy and instead act like a generator during a power cut. 'We wanted to create a storage system that makes you truly independent of the national power grid, that adequately supplies all of your household appliances at all times, and that remains efficient and trouble-free for at least 20 years, so that you can have the peace of mind that your investment really is worth every penny,' said the firm.

The firm said an average home can save around €1,200 a year (£876), so it would still take around seven years to recoup the costs, but the system will last for 20 years."
"That the UK is still 'bold' but 'dependable', 'outward looking' and a bastion of free trade. She has done that in private sessions with several leaders and a press conference with President Obama.
But very frank words from the United States, Japan and Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council, will steal plenty of the headlines instead.
Remember she was an advocate, albeit a pretty quiet one, of staying in the EU in the first place, with the economy one of her main concerns. So Downing Street says she hasn't been surprised by the warnings about the future.
And perhaps dealing with public expressions of sentiments that have been already expressed in private isn't really the problem.
Perhaps the real difficulty for the now not so new prime minister is that the biggest demands on her abroad are the same as those at home. Other countries want more details of her plans for Britain's life after the EU.
But with no consensus, or anything like the details of post-Brexit Britain from government, there isn't that much that she can really tell them. The political danger of such a relatively blank page is that others will fill the space."
"Anthony Sideri hit rock bottom while wrapped in a dirty blanket on the floor of a jail infirmary bathroom in Middleton, Massachusetts. He was 25, shivering, sweating, throwing up and going through the full withdrawals of heroin. He had just robbed a bank after shooting up heroin all day. That was July 22, 2007, the day his life changed forever. It was the last time he used drugs, the first and only time he was arrested, and the first and only time to fully withdrawal from heroin. ""I knew that my whole world was over, and I thought I was going to die because I never had been so sick,"" Sideri said. ""I had nothing to my name, and I didn't know if anyone else in the world even knew I was there."" Nearly eight years later, Sideri looks back on his drug-using days like it was another person's life. Sideri was your average student in high school playing on the hockey team, occasionally drinking and smoking weed until he began using drugs on a daily basis. He can't pinpoint exactly when it started or how or why, but it got to the point where he was smoking marijuana before, during and after school, and experimenting with mushrooms and acid. ""Anything else that I saw, I would have tried,"" he says now. His grades dropped, he lost his eligibility to play sports, but when he was drunk or high, none of that mattered. ""I didn't have to worry about what anyone thought, I could just go to a fantasy land and not have worries,"" Sideri said. After graduating from high school in 2000, Sideri began abusing Percocet and OxyContin, opium-containing painkillers. As his tolerance to the pills built up, he began snorting the drugs to feel the effects faster. Then he moved on to snorting heroin. ""I wasn't getting the strong effects of OxyContin anymore, and I was already sniffing something else, so it didn't seem like a leap,"" he said. ""It didn't seem like the heroin I grew up knowing about."" By 2005, he had been snorting heroin daily for two years. Even as he was doing more and more drugs, he was in denial about his addiction since he had a job with his family's wholesale snack supply business and a second job as a nightclub bouncer, worked out at the gym and had his own car and a place to live. ""On the outside, I had it all,"" Sideri said. That all changed the day he stuck out his arm and had someone put in a needle. Once Sideri started shooting up heroin, his life spiraled downward in only four months. He was hiding from his loved ones and his drug problem was obvious to everyone around him. He still thought he could control his drug use and quit on his own. ""I really thought I could stop the next day, but I always had an excuse,"" Sideri said. ""I was closed off from the rest of the world. ... I wasn't even a part of it anymore."" By July 2007, he had no more money to fuel his addiction. Out of ""pure desperation,"" he robbed a bank in Danvers, Massachusetts, with another addict. ""Robbing a bank seemed like a way to get a lot of money fast, which equaled a lot of heroin,"" said Sideri. ""That would hold me over for a long time ... I thought."" As Sideri describes it, his partner entered the bank and handed the teller a cell phone. Sideri was on the other end, claiming to have a hostage. The men left with the money and were caught after a brief chase. ""Getting caught never even crossed my mind,"" he said. ""I was instead planning what I was going to do after: Get drugs."" That was the last day he ever used. Sideri spent the next couple of weeks curled up on the floor of a jail cell withdrawing, cold turkey, from his years of heroin abuse. He describes the withdrawals as like ""having food poisoning for three days straight,"" combined with a burning, tingling sensation in his bones. ""I would flex and punch the floor to try to make it go away. I couldn't stop it, and I couldn't sit still,"" he said. ""Boiling hot showers were the only thing that felt better. Burning, burning, burning."" He was convicted of larceny, conspiracy and threatening to steal from a depository for his part in the robbery. He spent a year in court-ordered rehab and another 22 months in jail. ""Jail was the catapult for me,"" Sideri said. ""It finally made me say, 'It's over.' "" Once released in 2010, Sideri vowed to never let drugs influence his life again. He will be celebrating eight years sober this July and has made tremendous strides to repair his life. He is working full time as a salesman for his family's business and is attending school to become a substance abuse counselor. He is married with a 1-year-old daughter. And he completed probation last month. ""I live a life of honesty and integrity, even when no one is looking,"" Sideri said. ""I have a daughter who adores me and thinks I am her hero. And I can be, now."" It's been a long journey. He spent nearly eight years rebuilding his relationships with his family, paying off debts, fixing his bad credit and rebuilding his reputation in his small town of North Andover. He wants others to know him as the hardworking family man he is now and not judge him by his past. He acknowledges that it's always going to be an uphill battle for others to not to have a preconceived image of him. ""Many people only know about my robbery, addiction and jail time,"" he said. ""They have no idea about who or what I am now."" Sideri says he hopes ""the ripple effects of being true to myself will eventually drown out the bad."" He already sees that happening when he Googles his name and the robbery is no longer the first story that comes up. He visits high school groups to help encourage students to not fall down the path he took and to encourage others to get help. ""Anthony was a great kid growing up, but he lost his way, "" said Rick Gorman, executive director of North Andover Youth and Recreation Services. Gorman has known Sideri since he was in middle school, and tried to help him in high school. ""He is a perfect example that addiction doesn't mean the end of the world."" To those trying to recover from drugs, Sideri offers two pieces of advice: . 1. Tell everybody. ""A lot of families and individuals tend to think or say, 'Don't tell anyone,' or 'No one has to know.' The first step in recovery is honesty. When you hide any part of your mistakes or indiscretions, you are blocking yourself from being free from it."" 2. Surround yourself with people who make you want to be a better person. ""If you hang out in a barber shop long enough, you're gonna get a haircut. You have to honestly re-evaluate who you spend time with and remove people who are still using and making other bad choices."" Sideri has many new goals in life. One is to be an example of what recovery looks like and how an addict can truly change. The bottom line, he says: Recovery and long-term sobriety is possible."

"Twelve homes were evacuated after the hole opened in Ripon, North Yorkshire, at 22:30 GMT on Wednesday.
The hole measured about 20m (66ft) by 10m (33ft) and 9m (30ft) deep.
The BGS said Ripon lies in one of the most susceptible areas of the UK for sinkholes because of its ""Permian gypsum deposits"".
It said these can dissolve more quickly than surrounding limestone, leading to the enlargement of underground caves.
Experts are still examining data from the site behind the houses in Magdalen's Road but, releasing its initial findings, the BGS said sinkholes were often caused by surface water penetrating the ground, or fluctuations in groundwater levels.
In 2014, a 100-year-old detached house in an adjoining street was demolished after a 25ft-wide (8m) sinkhole opened.
According to the report, the wider area of Ripon periodically encounters sinkholes and in the 1980s and 1990s a hole was appearing every two to three years.
No-one was injured in the latest collapse with the back gardens of two properties the worst affected.
A sewerage system connected to several of the properties on the terrace fell in as the hole appeared.
One resident described seeing the ground moving and finding her steps leading into the garden had gone.
On Friday, further cracks appeared in the ground and on walls at the site.
Ben Cairns, North Yorkshire Fire Service station manager, said: ""Our main concern at the moment is what impact the weather is going to have for the next few days.""
The BGS is continuing to analyse data from the site."
"Indongo, unbeaten in 21 fights prior to this unification contest, forced his fellow 34-year-old on to the back foot for much of the fight.
Burns rallied in the fifth and sixth rounds but the tall southpaw emerged a worthy winner.
That was reflected in the judges' scoring - 120-108, 118-110, 116-112.
""The better man won on the night, no excuses,"" said Burns. And no-one could argue.
Media playback is not supported on this device
This was Burns' third fight at the Hydro and 13th at world title level, while Indongo - ""on a mission"" from Namibia's president Hage Geingob - was fighting overseas for only the second time as a professional.
On his first, in December, he knocked out IBF champion Eduard Troyanovsky in Moscow.
It was clear from early in Saturday's fight that Indongo would try to use his greater height and reach to throw jabs at Burns' head, and he did this to good effect in the opening three minutes.
Burns has started slowly in recent fights before finding his rhythm, and the Namibian began much the livelier, bouncing around the centre of the ring against a hesitant home fighter.
Indeed, he looked to have won the first four rounds by dint of his greater work-rate and accuracy, though Burns was beginning to connect with his right.
With their man having 47 bouts under his belt to Indongo's 21, the home fans may have wondered if the tactic was to use his experience to let his opponent tire himself out.
Rounds five and six signalled an improvement in Burns' form, with his aggression rewarded as Indongo was forced backwards for the first time.
The lead Indongo had built was thanks to the accumulation of cleaner shots rather than anything that badly hurt the Coatbridge fighter in his 17th year as a professional.
And, though Burns was still strong in defence, by the time the ninth round had ended he must have realised he was trailing heavily on the scorecards.
His task in the remaining three rounds had to be to stop Indongo for the first time in his nine-year career.
That looked increasingly unlikely as he struggled to get inside to inflict damage. Too often he was over-stretching to land a meaningful shot, and when he did trouble Indongo his opponent snuffed out the attack with footwork and by holding on.
It leaves Burns' dreams of a further unification bout against Terence Crawford in Las Vegas in tatters, though it would be a surprise if he was considering retiring.
Ricky Burns: ""He was so so awkward. He was a lot better than we thought he was going to be. He can hit as well.
""I'm going to have all the doubters saying I'm finished - but I'll come again.
""He started the rounds fast and the height and reach advantage meant he was out of my distance.""
Julius Indongo: ""I feel very proud. My home crowd are watching. It's for the whole of Africa. This is so great.
""I am very proud for opening my doors and now the world can see me.""
Adam Booth, David Haye's former trainer, on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra:
""It was pretty one-dimensional from Ricky Burns, who was trying to jump in from long distance on a fighter who was bigger, with longer arms and a heavy puncher.
""Indongo was dominant, knew what he was about, kept swinging dangerous bombs and didn't let Burns in at all.
""In the last two rounds, when he had the match won, he still wanted to dominate, and like true champions, wanted to get rid of his challenger.
""He ticks all the right boxes. It is going to take a high-level operator to cope with him. I think Terence Crawford is that kind of guy."""
"A Spanish woman found dead alongside her British partner and two children in Gibraltar is believed to have killed her family before taking her own life. Anarda De La Caridad Perez Friman, 37, is said to have been 'suffering from post-natal depression' when she allegedly stabbed John Joseph Shannon, 31, the couple's six-week-old baby and her daughter, four. Mr Shannon, from Liverpool, had initially been accused of killing his partner and the two children, but police now believe Perez Friman, a Spanish national of Cuban descent, to be the culprit. Scene: John Joseph Shannon, from Liverpool, was found dead alongside his partner Anarda De La Caridad Perez Friman, 37, their six-week-old baby Eve and Perez Friman's daughter . The couple and the two children, identified as Eve Shannon Perez, and Amanda Kristoffersen Perez, Perez Friman's daughter from a previous relationship, were found dead earlier this week. According to police, the scene was so horrific that the officers who found their bodies were offered counselling. The family, who lived in Estepona, Spain, had arrived in Gibraltar on March 25, and were staying in an apartment in the Boschetti Steps area owned by a family friend. Perez Friman is said to have suffered a 'psychotic incident' as a result of post-natal depression, and stabbed her partner and the two children before taking her own life, the Sunday Express reports. According to the newspaper, Mr Shannon's body was found with defensive wounds which suggest that he has been trying to protect the children before being killed. Accusations: Initial reports indicated that Mr Shannon was responsible for the gruesome killings, but police now believe that Perez Friman suffered a 'psychotic incident' as a result of post-natal depression . Acting superintendent Wayne Tunbridge, who is leading the investigation, said: 'We are not looking for anyone outside of the family at this stage but we have numerous lines of enquiry. 'We are in communication with the family members of the four deceased who now must come to Gibraltar before we release any details about the individuals. The family were found in the rented flat in the Boschetti's Steps area at 11.35am on Monday. Royal Gibraltar Police said the family had been living in Estepona, Malaga before arriving in Gibraltar and 'it is understood that it was their intention to travel to the United Kingdom'. Gibraltar police is now awaiting the results of postmortem examinations conducted by Home Office pathologists."

"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is continuing to rule with an iron fist, having ordered the execution of about 15 senior officials so far this year, according to an assessment by South Korean intelligence agents, a lawmaker who attended a closed briefing said. Shin Kyung-min, a lawmaker with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, told a handful of reporters that he had been given the information by the South Korean National Intelligence Service. CNN cannot independently confirm the executions. The nature of the intelligence supporting the National Intelligence Service allegations was also not immediately clear. North Korea is one of the most closed societies in the world. According to Shin, intelligence officials say Kim is ruling in an impromptu manner and does not countenance excuses or any views at variance with his own. He considers those a challenge to his authority, the intelligence officials said, according to Shin. For example, a senior official with Ministry of Forestry was executed for expressing dissatisfaction with the country's forestry program, the lawmaker said. North Korean defectors share their ordeals . The vice chairman of the State Planning Commission was executed because he objected to changing the design of a science and technology hall from a rounded shape to one resembling a flower, the intelligence officials said, according to the lawmaker. And in March, according to the South Korean lawmaker, Kim executed on charges of espionage four members of the Unhasu Orchestra, including the general director, because of a scandal, Shin said. Kim became North Korea's Supreme Commander in December 2011 following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il. According to the National Intelligence Service, he is reported to have executed 17 senior officials in 2012, 10 in 2013 and 41 in 2014. The National Intelligence Service says there is a strong possibility that Kim will visit Russia, but given his nature, there is no way to be sure until the last minute.

Huddersfield's Jacob Fairbank, pictured during a spell at London Broncos, faces a spell on the sidelines . 'He was only saying the other day how much he was enjoying regular week in, week out rugby after his first uninterrupted off-season for a long time and was keen to push his way into Paul Anderson's thinking. 'It's too early to put a time frame on his return with swelling making a precise diagnosis tricky, but it goes without saying that he knows he will get every possible help here medically to get him back out onto the paddock as soon as possible.'"
"Two children have been killed in what police are calling an accidental vehicle fire at a Las Vegas apartment complex. Investigators say four children were playing in and around a parked minivan Saturday evening at the Arcadia Palms on East Sahara Avenue  when one of them unintentionally set a fire inside. Two of the children managed to escape unharmed and quickly requested help. The other two children became trapped and were found dead inside after the fire was put out. Two young children have died after a minivan they were playing in on the parking lot of the Arcadia Palms apartment complex in Las Vegas caught fire and exploded (police scene pictured) Police say it appears the 6pm fire was unintentional and accidental, and no criminal charges are expected because of the age of the child who started the fire. The names and ages of the children as well as the cause of the fire were not immediately released. Kelvin Young, 29, a resident of the complex, told the Las Vegas Review Journal he went toward the burning vehicle after he saw a plume of smoke. Shortly after, he described hearing a woman shout 'My baby!' and 'My nephew!' Another resident told KLAS-TV that a woman, believed to be one of the boy's mother, was taken to hospital shortly after the incident and described hearing a huge explosion. They said authorities informed them the pair were related. Residents at the apartment complex say they heard a huge explosion followed by a massive plume of smoke .

Websites indicate there was property has also been home to Pharaoh's Daughters, a school for strippers, but Lowndes has repeatedly fallen foul of complaints about noisey private functions held on the grounds. On Friday the county code enforcement board found that Lownds had violated their rules by holding events without the right permit and running a business in a residential neighborhood. His company, Pink Tati LLC, was given seven days to prove the property is in compliance and he was warned he will be fined $1,000 a day if further commercial functions takes place. 'Basically it's the noise that got our attention,' neighbor Ronald Nagy told Bay News. He lives in the nearby Cheval West community. 'I've never been involved in running a stripper school,' said Lowndes, who made millions selling mattresses and hearing aids. 'There's never been any porn parties. There's never been anything illegal other than the noise complaint.' Lowndes said he disagrees with the board's decision, but has decided that it is best if he sells up. He has put the property back on the market for $2.3 million. 'With all this violation stuff, I said, ""fine, that's it, I'm out of here.'"" he said.

Neighbor Nagy had seen ads for the party and filed a complaint with the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office and Code Enforcement. 'This to me seems like there was an undercurrent of very sexually-related activities,' he told the Tampa Tribune. 'They're gaming the system.' After months of complaints both Lownds and Sean Grey, the mansion's manager, got hit with code violations. On its website, Pharaoh's Palace was advertised as the 'perfect' place for entertaining. Other ads on the internet said it was available for rent to producers for music videos, television and film, as well as event planners and professional photographers.

"Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, said she drank body lotion because she was hungry and thirsty.
She was only brought out on Saturday morning after security forces found a teacher she knew to convince her it was safe to come out.
Ms Cheroitich said her ordeal began at around 05:30 (02:30 GMT) on Thursday when she and her fellow students were in class studying for their exams.
""Suddenly, we heard the bullets and then we started coming out and then we said: 'What is happening?'"" she told the Associated Press news agency.
""We ran to our rooms, then these people came running, following us. When we reached our rooms, we hide under the beds.""
She said that their pursuers told them to come out of their hiding places, but she decided to hide in the wardrobe instead where she covered herself with some clothes.
It was then that the gunmen entered the room. Ms Cheroitich described a scenario that other survivors have alluded to.
Her roommates were taken out and divided up between those who were able to recite verses of the Koran and those who were not.
It was not clear what happened to them.
She said she found some bottles of body lotion where she was hiding and ""drank all of them"", describing it as ""nice and lovely"".
But she was too scared to move. ""I was just praying to my God,"" she said.
It was not until 10:00 on Saturday, long after the attack ended, that the authorities were able to persuade her to come out.
She told AP: ""You know at first I did not believe it [when police came to rescue her], at first I was thinking that maybe they were the al-Shabab.  So I said: 'How do I know that you are the Kenyan police?'""
It was only after a member of the college staff came to convince her that it was safe to come out that she emerged."
"Demonstrators marched outside the Iranian embassy accusing Tehran of interfering in Afghanistan's affairs.
Soaring fuel prices have angered many Afghans at a time of high demand during winter.
Afghan officials say 2,500 fuel tankers are stranded at the border. Iran denies blocking fuel exports to Afghanistan.
It is thought the Iranian government fears the fuel could be used by foreign forces, but Afghan officials say these concerns are unfounded.
Earlier this week Iran's ambassador in Kabul, Fadahoseyn Malaki, dismissed reports that Iran had barred fuel exports to Afghanistan.
""We give fuel to the Afghan nation,"" he told a news conference, although he added his government still had concerns which ""should be addressed"".
Friday's demonstration was led by Afghan MP Najib Kabuli, who has organised similar protests against Iran in the past."
"The prospect of a 'Blukip' alliance between David Cameron and Nigel Farage is now just as likely as a coalition between the SNP and Labour, Nick Clegg claimed today. The Deputy Prime Minister said there was a 'very real danger' that Ukip and Northern Ireland's DUP could hold Mr Cameron to 'ransom' in the event of a second hung Parliament. Mr Clegg's remarks come after Mr Farage  held out an olive branch to the Prime Minister last night - as he said he wanted to work with him to prevent a possible Labour government. The Lib Dems released a new campaign poster this morning warning of the danger of a 'BluKip' alliance between the Tories and Ukip . The Ukip leader called on Conservatives to vote tactically for him in seats where they cannot win in order to help keep the Tory leader as Prime Minister. And in the strongest hint yet that they could work together, Mr Farage dropped his demand that the Tories ditch Mr Cameron before any post election deal. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the remarks showed that the 'mood music' had changed in the Conservative Party. He said: 'Only yesterday there were reports of Nigel Farage opening 'back channels' with the Tories to discuss a post-election pact. 'The Tory right wing has been waiting for its moment to reclaim the Conservative Party for years. 'And, with the help of MPs from UKIP and the DUP, that moment may be about to come.' Mr Clegg added: 'Everyone knows that David Cameron and Ed Miliband won't win this general election outright. 'That means that someone else will hold the balance of power on 8 May. The prospect of a left wing alliance between Labour and the SNP has been well covered.' The Deputy Prime Minister said there was a 'very real danger' that Ukip and Northern Ireland's DUP could hold Mr Cameron to 'ransom' in the event of a second hung Parliament . But he added: 'What's equally possible is an alliance that will drag Britain further and further to the right: BLUKIP – a bloc of right wingers from UKIP, the Conservatives and the DUP that could hold the balance of power. 'There is a very real danger that Nigel Farage and his friends could hold David Cameron to ransom.' It comes after Mr Farage issued a direct appeal to Tory voters yesterday. Mr Farage said he believed many were in 'their hearts' closer to his position of wanting an EU referendum as soon as possible without any attempted re-negotiation. Mr Farage also revealed that he has already held informal discussions with Tories about potential post-election arrangements. Yesterday, as he launched his party's manifesto, Mr Farage called on Mr Cameron to join with him to lock Ed Miliband and the SNP's Alex Salmond out of Downing Street. The Lib Dem leader's remarks come after Mr Farage (right) held out an olive branch to the Prime Minister (pictured in Glasgow this morning left) last night - as he said he wanted to work with him to prevent a possible Labour government . Ukip has reduced its list of targets to just ten seats as it has been squeezed in the polls, but Mr Farage believes in seats such as Great Grimsby and Dudley North it has a better chance than the Tories at snatching them from Labour. Asked if it was time that Conservative supporters realised that Ukip could help them stop a Labour government, Mr Farage said they needed to vote tactically. He said: 'One of the things I have completely failed to understand is how the Conservatives would want to say vote Ukip get Labour in constituencies like Grimsby and Rotherham and Dudley North and all those Labour seats in which we are the challenger. I just don't understand it.' He warned that a Labour-led government backed up by the SNP 'would not be a very good thing for the country'. DUP leader Nigel Dodds could help prop up the Tories in power in the event of another hung Parliament . Asked if he and Mr Cameron could 'lock out' Mr Miliband and Mr Salmond from Downing Street, he replied: 'Well if that were possible then we would try and do that.' Mr Farage previously said that Mr Cameron would need to step down as Tory leader before he could do any sort of post-election deal. But yesterday he said there would be no problem working with Mr Cameron personally. He said: 'Albeit reluctantly, David Cameron has been forced into making a pledge on a referendum. There are circumstances in which we could do a deal with him but the referendum has got to be a proper one and not in 2017.' Mr Cameron a fortnight ago urged Conservative supporters who have defected to Ukip to 'come home' and pleaded with them not to use their vote in the General Election as a 'protest'. Yesterday asked what his message was to Tory voters, Mr Farage called on them to work with him to bring forward the referendum Mr Cameron has promised on EU membership by 2017. He made a reference to comments by Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, that any meaningful renegotiation would not be possible until 2019. He said: 'I've said from the start there is no re-negotiation of any value whatsoever and it would appear that my old mate Mr Juncker is backing that up. 'The idea that we would need to wait for two or more years for a referendum is not something that I find acceptable.' Mr Farage said he would also want the Tories to match his commitment to Nato's target of spending 2 per cent of national income on defence. He admitted that he had already been involved in 'informal' discussions with those in other parties about possible deals. As well as an early referendum on withdrawal from the EU, the Ukip manifesto promised a radical reduction in immigration, increased spending on defence and an £18billion tax giveaway."
"An Australian kangaroo has hopped to it's freedom, shocking onlookers in West Germany. Police in Rhein Erft, received a bizarre phone call explaining that a large kangaroo was spotted 'happily' hopping through a field. They immediately assumed it was a April Fools prank and dismissed the strange call. Scroll down for video . Police in Rhein Erft, Germany initially dismissed reports that a kangaroo was found hopping in a field nearby . They discovered that the call was in fact serious and later found the Australian marsupial in a field in Bruhl . It wasn't until the caller was questioned in detail and provided 'very believable' answers, that the police realised that they were telling the truth. They were shocked to find a large, Australian kangaroo 'happily' hopping through a field in the town of Bruhl, 20 kilometres south of the city centre of Cologne.

Lewis Hamilton took third ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, who obeyed an order to stay behind.
Ferrari's Fernando Alonso crashed on the second lap after breaking his front wing.
The Spaniard's team-mate Felipe Massa took fifth, fighting past the Lotus cars of Romain Grosjean and Kimi Raikkonen in the closing laps after the Lotus team's gamble to try to do only three pit stops rather than four failed.
Grosjean finished sixth ahead of Raikkonen, who won the first race in Australia last weekend.
McLaren's Jenson Button was on for a points-scoring finish, possibly in fifth place, before he was sent on his way from a pit stop with a loose front wheel.
The Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg took eighth ahead of McLaren's Sergio Perez, with Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne 10th.
It was a race full of drama as the intra-team battles at Red Bull and Mercedes played out live.
""The Malaysian Grand Prix team orders controversy at Red Bull is only the latest episode of a long-running drama between Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber.
""It goes right back to 2010, when the two crashed while Vettel tried to pass Webber for the lead of the Turkish Grand Prix.
""Since then, there has been a litany of further incidents at the team as the two men, both intensely determined and tough but very different in other ways, have battled for supremacy.
""Adding spice to it is Webber's belief that, while they profess to allow them to battle it out on the track, the team is more behind Vettel than him.
""The belief - widely shared within F1 - is founded on the way the team have responded to the various situations between their drivers.
""In their battle in Malaysia there may even have been a bit of residual revenge on Vettel's part - the German and his champion at Red Bull, motorsport chief Helmet Marko, felt Webber was obstructive in last season's title-deciding Brazilian Grand Prix.""
The battle between the Red Bulls was resolved in an intense scrap as Webber rejoined from his final pit stop.
Vettel was warned by team boss Christian Horner that he was being ""silly"" but the two then battled wheel-to-wheel around Turns One and Two onto Turn Four, where Webber appeared finally to yield to his team-mate despite having the inside line.
Webber said: ""After the last stop the team told me the race was over and we turned the engines down and go to the end. The team made their decision. Seb made his own decision and he will have protection as usual.""
Vettel was told over the radio after the race: ""Good job, Seb. Looks like you wanted it bad enough. Still you've got some explaining to do.""
Webber had initially taken the lead at the first stops as the drivers came in to fit dry-weather tyres following a wet start.
He had led the race throughout, with the two Red Bull drivers using the two available tyre compounds in different orders.
Vettel chose to end the race on the softer 'medium' tyre while Webber was on the hard.
Vettel said: ""Obviously it is very hot and if there is something to say we need to say it internally.""
Red Bull motorsport chief Helmut Marko, a powerful champion of Vettel, admitted the battle had ""got out of control"".
Meanwhile, there was controversy at Mercedes as Rosberg followed Hamilton closely in the final laps.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Rosberg asked the team to let him pass Hamilton, but was told ""negative"" by team boss Ross Brawn.
When he complained again, Brawn told him that Hamilton - who had earlier been told to save fuel - was also being ""controlled"" and could also go faster.
Hamilton admitted on the podium: ""I can't say it's the best feeling being up here today. If I'm honest I really feel Nico should be standing here.""
Hamilton had provided an amusing diversion when, coming in for his second stop, he headed into the pit box of former team McLaren before being waved on towards Mercedes.
""I did a Jenson,"" he said. ""He did it a couple of years ago and I've done it today. Apologies to my team.""
The result puts Vettel into the championship lead by 11 points from Raikkonen. Webber is five points further adrift and ahead of Hamilton, Massa and Alonso, who is already 22 points behind Vettel, the man who narrowly beat him to the title 2010 and 2012.
Alonso started third and was up to second, past Massa, by the first corner. But he tapped the back of Vettel's car in Turn Two.
It was the lightest of touches but enough to break the front wing mounts.
He held onto second place throughout the first lap but did not stop to change it and it collapsed heading into Turn One on the second lap, sending him into the gravel trap. Ferrari said the decision not to stop was made in the pits.
Alonso wrote later on Twitter: ""Bad luck today. As always over 19 races we will be compensated and we are ready to recover good points in the next race.""

"Underlining a change across the nation, nearly 90per cent of U.S. adults now say they have health insurance, according to an extensive survey released Monday. Researchers behind the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index say the number of uninsured Americans is now at a record low. When tracking began in 2008 roughly 14per cent of citizens were uninsured, peaking at 18per cent in the third quarter of 2013. But marking a shift in the trend, for the first three months of this year the rate dropped to 11.9per cent. Whether the new findings turn out to be a high-water mark for President Barack Obama's health care law, or a milestone on the path toward his goal of getting virtually all U.S. residents covered, remains to be seen. Underlining a change across the nation, nearly nine in ten adults now say they have health insurance, according to an extensive survey released Monday . The law's future is still up in the air, and will turn on factors ranging from an upcoming Supreme Court decision on consumer subsidies to actions by Republican leaders in states opposed to Medicaid expansion. The latest update from the Gallup-Healthways survey overlaps with the period when the health law's second sign-up season was winding down. Coverage gains from 2014-2015 translate to about 3.6 million fewer adults uninsured since the fall, before open enrollment got under way, according to Gallup. 'The Affordable Care Act had three major objectives: increase coverage, slow the rate of increase in costs, and improve health,' said Dan Witters, research director for the poll. 'The first one is clearly a win. Coverage is increasing; there is no question about it.' On balance, an estimated 14.75 million adults have gained coverage since the fall of 2013, when the law's first open enrollment season was about to begin, according to Gallup. The uninsured rate lowest since Gallup and Healthways began tracking in 2008 . 'A big outstanding question is what will happen over the next couple of years,' said Larry Levitt, a health insurance expert with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. 'To meet expectations, enrollment has to continue to grow and push the number of uninsured down.' The Gallup-Healthways survey is closely followed because it combines the depth of government-sponsored research with the timeliness of media polls. Pollsters interview 500 people a day, nearly every day of the year. One of the questions they ask is whether people have health insurance. The health care law offers subsidized private insurance for people who don't have access to job-based coverage, combined with an expansion of Medicaid aimed at low-income adults in states that accept it. Big states like Florida and Texas are among those refusing to expand Medicaid. The law requires nearly all Americans to have coverage, either through an employer, a government program, or by purchasing their own plan. Those remaining uninsured risk fines. It also provides subsidies to help low-to moderate-income people buy their own insurance. Comparing the most recent sign-up period with the first open enrollment season, the survey found that the uninsured rate declined at a slightly slower pace this time around. In the first three months of this year, the uninsured rate fell by one percentage point. Over the same period last year there was a 1.5 percentage-point decline. From government officials to local volunteers, many people involved with the health care law expected some kind of second-year slowdown. Open enrollment season was shorter, and those who had remained uninsured were seen as more skeptical about the value of coverage. The survey also found that Hispanics saw the biggest coverage gains of any ethnic or racial group. The uninsured rate dropped 8.3 points among Latinos since the end of 2013. Even so, Hispanics are still more likely to be uninsured. 'At a time when Republicans are very keenly trying to court the Hispanic vote, a large chunk of Hispanics are gaining insurance via the Affordable Care Act,' Witters said. President Barack Obama's health care law requires nearly all Americans to have coverage, either through an employer, a government program, or by purchasing their own plan - those remaining uninsured risk fines . The most notable improvement has been among those making less than $36,000 a year, a group that traditionally struggled to get and keep health insurance . Recent gains in coverage have benefited people up and down the income ladder. But the most notable improvement has been among those making less than $36,000 a year, a group that traditionally struggled to get and keep health insurance. Their uninsured rate dropped 8.7 points since the end of 2013. Although the economic recovery is likely to be contributing to coverage gains, the uninsured rate is now significantly lower than it was in early 2008, before the recession. That suggests that the gains in coverage are due to more than an improving economy. Five years after its passage, the biggest question now for Obama's health care law is a Supreme Court challenge. Opponents of the law argue that its literal language only allows the government to subsidize premiums in states that set up their own online insurance markets. Most have not done so, defaulting to the federal HealthCare.gov. Supporters say that while some provisions may be confusing when read in isolation, the intent of Congress was to help consumers in every state pay their premiums. A decision in that case is expected by late June. The survey results were based on landline and cellphone interviews conducted from January 2 to March 31 with a random sample of 43,575 adults ages 18 and older. For results based on the total sample, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point."

"Maya Kantengule was found at the bottom of a swimming pool at Waveney River Centre holiday park in Burgh St Peter, Norfolk, on May 1 2016.
She was declared dead later that day at James Paget University Hospital.
South Norfolk Council environmental health officer Chris Coker said people swam at the centre at their own risk.
Maya's father, Livial Kantengule, said in a written statement at the inquest in Norwich that he spoke to Jane Rainer, the mother of his daughter's best friend, as he arrived and decided not to wait at the pool during the party.
He returned there with his wife, Glenda, after receiving a message there had been an accident.
Maya had already been taken to the hospital near Great Yarmouth. Her parents were at her bedside when she was pronounced dead.
Mr Kantengule said he did not ask if there was a lifeguard.
""Jane used to volunteer to help with the swimming lessons, so we assumed Maya would be adequately supervised while in the pool,"" he said.
Maya, from Smith's Walk, Oulton Broad, near Lowestoft, Suffolk, attended Dell Primary School.
Jaqueline Bell, a teaching assistant at the school, said in a written statement that Maya started weekly swimming lessons in reception year.
""She was nervous in the water and would use armbands and a woggle,"" she said.
Mr Coker told the inquest the indoor pool at Waveney River Centre could be privately hired.
He said it was 1.5m (5ft) at its deepest and signs were up stating there were no lifeguards on duty and that people swam at their own risk.
The inquest, expected to last two days, continues."
"UKSE is the Tata Steel subsidiary set up to assist growing companies in traditional steel areas.
ID Systems works in the industrial and commercial utilities sector from its offices in Grangemouth and Glasgow.
Its clients include Scottish Water, Forestry Commission and National Grid.
The company, which already employs 80 staff, is looking to create the new jobs in the Glasgow and Lanarkshire areas as part of an expansion drive..
The move comes after ID Systems secured a number of long-term projects, including off-site manufacturing of wastewater pumping stations and water booster sets.
The loan and equity backing from UKSE will help fund ID System's growth strategy. A new senior management team will be created which, along with UKSE, will have a shareholding in the company.
ID Systems finance director Stuart Devine said: ""We had a tremendous opportunity to more than double the workforce with the recent contract win and this funding from UKSE will allow us to make that happen as smoothly as possible.""
UKSE regional executive Scott Webb said: ""This long-standing, growing business will now have the structure to continue expansion along with the necessary funding from UKSE to allow this to happen."""
"The election on the 8 June is for the Westminster parliament, rather than the assembly, but parties are now in the habit of producing a distinct document for Wales.
They may include distinctive policies for Wales which can be implemented at Westminster, and may include proposal the parties for Wales' devolved policy areas.
You can find links here to detailed guides for each party - and we have listed the key pledges from each manifesto.

Skim-reading some of these manifestos, you might think that your vote will settle issues such as health and education in Wales.
But it will not.
Wales has a system of government where a number of things are in the hands of locally elected assembly members who sit in the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff Bay.
The last assembly election took place in 2016 and the next one is currently pegged for 2021.
Broadly, areas that are devolved include:
Things that are not devolved include foreign affairs, benefits, the armed forces, big energy projects, the Severn bridges and negotiations to leave the EU.
Having said this, the money that comes to Wales to fund locally controlled services still largely comes from Westminster.
So MPs can have an effect on the overall amount of cash that is spent at Cardiff, but it is up to ministers here to decide how to spend it."
"Jose Mourinho has declared that he doesn't care where Chelsea win the Premier League, so long as they end up claiming the title. The Blues lead the table by six points, with a game in hand, and face Stoke City at home on Saturday in the first of their final nine games of the season. 'I dont care if it is in the hotel or away or at home, I just want to win it,' said Mourinho, as Chelsea trained at Cobham on Friday. Jose Mourinho was speaking at Chelsea's press conference ahead of their Premier League clash . Eden Hazard will start for Chelsea against Stoke City on Saturday following a tiring international break . Mourinho (right) watches as his players Filipe Luis (left) and Nemanja Matic train . 'In any occasion I think the club who wins it gets the trophy in our last match at home, and our last game of the season is at home (to Sunderland). 'So if we win the title we get the trophy at our house. But I don't care, even if somebody loses the trophy and we don't get it I am happy with that. I just want to win it.' Mourinho will start Eden Hazard against Stoke on Saturday despite the player suggesting he is tired. The Belgian said earlier this week he is feeling weary as the season reaches its climax. But the Chelsea manager, who also confirmed Diego Costa has recovered from a hamstring injury, will not take his wing wizard out of the firing line against the Potters.

Juan Cuadrado (left) battles team-mate Cesar Azpilicueta (centre) for the ball . Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas attempts a pass under pressure from team-mate Ramires . 'Hazard is tired because he played two matches in three days,' said Mourinho. 'He travelled and didn't sleep because he arrived in Belgium at 5 or 6 in the morning after playing in Israel. We think he can recover in these couple of days, but he plays tomorrow (Saturday). 'That's football. That's what a season is like for a player who is important for both his club and national team. I want to play him every time and the coach of his country wants to play him every time. 'He is a team player that plays with the ball, creates, dribbles and players with lots of intensity so it is not a surprise that he can be a bit tired. But I believe in him, the team and his ambition to play. 'And I believe in his desire to help the team reach their season objective, so I will start with him.' Hazard (left) in action for Belgium against Israel during their Euro 2016 qualifying win on Tuesday . Hazard started both games for Belgium during the international break, but was subbed off in both . Spain striker Costa missed the international break with injury, but could yet feature against Stoke at Stamford Bridge on Saturday evening after training for the last couple of days. However Mourinho refused to confirm whether his top scorer would start the game. 'Diego trained on Thursday and Friday with the group,' continued Mourinho. 'He is not injured but I don't know if I will start with him or not. I need to analyse the situation with him and make a decision.' 'He dedicated himself to getting fit on his days off, working hard in the morning and afternoon. We can say that we did all the tests and scans to confirm  that scientifically at this moment the muscle is fine. 'But in football you need the confidence to know you  are free to express maximum intensity, and that's our doubt. So we'll see in the next 24 hours then decide.'

Costa vies for the ball with fellow Chelsea striker Didier Drogba (left) at Cobham . Louis van Gaal's Manchester United still have a chance of winning the league, according to Mourinho . Although they sit six points clear at the top of the league with a game in hand on all their nearest rivals, Mourinho still believes that there is still a four-horse race for the title this season. 'Look at the points difference,' he said. 'You have to say four (teams) now. Not five, because there's a gap from fourth to fifth and, with eight matches to go, that's a difficult gap from first to fifth. 'But the points difference between second, third and fourth makes me think and feel that they are there.' He added: 'We need six victories and one draw from nine matches. It is a good situation for us, and one all the other clubs would like to have. But it's pure mathematics. We need to win six matches and draw one. We need to do that, and we haven't done it yet.' And despite Manchester United's inconsistency this season, Mourinho still believes Louis van Gaal's side are still in with a shot at the title. 'The number of the points is the number of points,' Mourinho added. 'They are there. The points are there. In the last few matches they've become consistent in results and the quality of their performances. They are there.'"
"The troubled NHS trust has been struggling financially and has some of the worst response times in England.
However, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said staff were committed to providing high quality, safe care despite suffering from low morale.
The health watchdog said inspectors also saw some ""outstanding practice"".
Prof Sir Mike Richards, the CQC's chief inspector of hospitals, said EMAS, which serves about 4.8m people across six counties, required improvement.
He said: ""There was an unrelenting demand for emergency services combined with a lack of staff and resources to meet the need.
""We found that while people were cared for and treated well, there were insufficient staff and a lack of appropriate skill-mix to meet the needs of patients in a timely manner.""
The trust was told it must ensure there are sufficient emergency vehicles to safely meet demand and response times must also meet the needs of patients by reaching national targets.
In April it was revealed EMAS had overspent by almost Â£12m in the last financial year and had to take out an additional loan to help with running costs.
Staff were also reported to be under pressure and unable to take scheduled breaks.
Richard Henderson, acting chief executive of EMAS, said: ""We will be continuing our recruitment campaigns. Last year we recruited over 300 staff. This year again we will be doing exactly the same.
""We will be increasing the numbers of vehicles available but most importantly we need to ensure we retain our existing workforce.""
EMAS said emergency calls had increased and handover delays at hospitals had caused it to incur the extra costs.
The service which covers Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire and Rutland has about 2,700 members of staff and receives approximately 2,000 calls a day."
"Straight after Easter on planet football comes squeaky bum time, but the only squeaking at Chelsea came from Jose Mourinho, trying to contain his mirth when told West Ham had the most positive tactics in England. Mourinho was having no truck with the Barclays Premier League's Fair Play table, which lauded the Hammers for their attacking style and frowned upon Chelsea's lack of respect. He dismissed it as a joke. He was relaxed ahead of a visit from Manchester United. He even offered support to Manuel Pellegrini, claiming the Manchester City boss had been treated like a 'criminal' after losing six of eight games. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has spoken out in defence of under pressure colleague Manuel Pellegrini .

United defender Chris Smalling scores his side's fourth goal as they beat City 4-2 at Old Trafford last week . Pellegrini poses with Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany (left) after winning the league last season . No love is lost between Mourinho and Pellegrini, but the Chelsea manager said: 'I'm surprised a team that won two titles in three years and are still champions can be brought to hell. 'It looks like they don't deserve respect, that they are bad players, that the manager is a bad manager, that they are a disaster. But they are the champions. 'You want lots of teams fighting for the title. 'So how can you be so negative with a team that's won two titles in three years? Some managers cannot win and life goes on, but the guys at Man City... it looks like they're criminals.' Victory on Saturday will extend Chelsea's lead over United to 11 points and inch Mourinho closer to his first Premier League title since 2006, having led from the start. 'We are boring, top of the league since day one,' said the Portuguese. 'Everyone would love the Premier League to be like the Championship, with four teams separated by a couple of points. 'I know this would be the ideal scenario, but since day one we are there. We are trying not to allow that to happen. We have big determination to be champions.' As for the Fair Play table, well, he couldn't care less. It is compiled using data from Premier League delegates who mark teams in six categories. The conduct of Chelsea's players towards match officials is rated the worst in the league and only Sunderland score worse when it comes to the behaviour of staff. 'I'm not surprised,' chuckled Mourinho. 'These delegates are the same delegates who do the evaluation of the referees' performances and I read them every week. 'I think it depends on the food and drink. We have to change the catering because we have the best and many times they don't see the games. Next season, bread and water.'

"Rooney, 30, played in midfield rather than as a striker and came under fire following the shock defeat by Iceland.
""He's our talisman, he's our greatest goalscorer, he's experienced and you don't want that to walk away at this stage,"" Lampard told BBC Sport.
""I would want him in the team and in the squad. He has certainly got another tournament in him.""
Rooney has scored a record 53 goals in 115 appearances for his country.
The Manchester United man was made England captain in August 2014 but has come under scrutiny for a number of disappointing displays.
He found the net from the penalty spot after just four minutes against Iceland but underperformed for most of the game in Nice as England went out of Euro 2016 at the last-16 stage.
In the wake of the defeat, Germany legend Lothar Matthaus said it was time for Rooney to retire from international football.
""Sadly, when his team needed him, Rooney was not that leader,"" he said.
""You need someone who can provide the impetus and rhythm. I thought Rooney could take the role but, when it mattered, he wasn't able to do it.""

""I think once we reflect a bit more, Wayne will remain a big player in the squad and will help with the development of the younger players around him,"" insisted Lampard, who won 106 caps for England.
However, the former Chelsea and West Ham midfielder thinks he needs to work out his best position for both club and country.
Under Louis van Gaal, Rooney began to play in midfield as well as a striker but that may change now Jose Mourinho is manager of Manchester United.
""I don't believe 31 is an age where you need to change position because of being 31, said Lampard, now playing in the United States with New York City.
""I think Wayne still has the pace, the ability and the knowhow to play as a striker, but the choice will obviously be between him and his managers.""
Rooney has already said he would continue to be available for international selection.
England's next game is a 2018 World Cup qualifier in Slovakia on 4 September.
England should not be afraid of appointing another foreign coach as a successor to Roy Hodgson, said Lampard, who played under Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson and Italian Fabio Capello during his time with the national side.
""Ideally, as a proud Englishman, you'd love an English manager,"" he said.
""But I think, in the modern world, you have to accept that, if the options aren't there, you have to look abroad.
""It wouldn't bother me if a foreign manager took an England team forward and was successful, not at all.""
England are looking for a new manager as Englishman Hodgson quit immediately after the defeat by Iceland.
Under Eriksson, England reached the quarter-finals at three successive major tournaments, while Capello led England to the 2010 World Cup and a 4-1 defeat by Germany in the second round.
""I think the best man for the job would be the starting point for picking the next manager,"" added Lampard, who would prefer a youthful boss, adding: ""Over the last 10-15 years, when I was playing, we weren't setting a new tone.
""I would look to a younger, forward-thinking manager who has a real strong idea about how he wants to play, plays good football, generates a good spirit in the team and go that way.""
But he believes it will not be a straightforward task for the Football Association.
""I can't give you the name, which is the problem, but they will have to have a confidence in the decision they make,"" said Lampard.
""They'll have to give him free reign to try to mould these good young players into a team that can fight at the top level."""
"In there, they can read books, watch television and play computer games. They have a kettle, a sink, a safe and most have a toilet.
The restriction of their liberty is the punishment for their crimes - not their lifestyle inside prison, according to residential officer Kerry Payne.
""Prison isn't a place for punishment anymore,"" she says. ""It's for somebody who's done something wrong to give them that time out to change their life because they don't get that stop-gap.
""Everything just keeps going till it ends up a bigger and bigger problem.""
Here, some prisoners describe their life behind bars.
James, 27, has been in and out of prison since he was 18 - he's served time in Polmont, Barlinnie and Kilmarnock, as well as Dumfries.
Outside, he is a joiner. While he is inside, he is a ""hall passman"" - responsible for cleaning part of the prison and for which he is paid Â£10 a week.
His cell is a cramped space with room for little more than a bed, a sink and a toilet. Prisoners are also provided with a safe with a lock that staff can override during inspections.
James's room is decorated with posters; he has a stereo and he pays Â£1 a week for a television.
""It's tiny, but it's mine,"" he says.
Jason is just over half way through a 13-month sentence at HMP Dumfries.
The 38-year-old has lost count of the number of times he has been locked up since he was remanded for a week when he was 14 years old.
""It's become a bit of a revolving door for me,"" he says.
Does prison help him?
""No, no. I think you've got to help yourself. Prison doesn't help me, no.
""I suppose over all the years, I've started to think a lot more. I'm getting older now so I'm starting to think a lot more about changing or certainly not doing the same things over and over again but that's taken a long time.""
So will this be his last prison sentence?  ""That's my idea, yeah.""
He is taking art lessons in prison - he enjoys it but he is unlikely to continue his hobby on the outside.
""There's a lot of things I need to address first,"" he says.
Does he enjoy being in prison? ""No, definitely not."" He'd rather have his freedom? ""Yeah, absolutely.""
Ryan, a former police officer, has 12 weeks left to serve of his sentence.
He served the first three weeks of his sentence at HMP Addiewell in West Lothian - the local prison for the 29-year-old from Lanarkshire.
""I was kept in isolation from the general population just because of the fact that everyone in the prison would have known me because I probably put a few of them in there,"" he says.
He was ""terrified"" of moving to Dumfries, away from his family, but he says staff ""couldn't have been more helpful"".
During his sentence he has trained as an industrial cleaner.
""I really enjoy the cleaning, to be fair. You're always kept busy, there's always something to do. And I take pride in it. I like to make sure the place is clean and it is presentable.""
He added: ""It's funny. I wouldn't say anyone enjoys being in here, that would be sort of masochistic. But I think having something to do, having a purpose, having something to work at does sort of make the days go quicker.
""But to the same effect, getting my visits at the weekend, it makes it a lot better."""
"On Wednesday, the electric carmaker reported a first quarter loss of $282m (Â£195m) up from $154m last year.
The loss was in line with investors' expectations, and the announcement that it was increasing production sent its shares up 4% in after-hours trading.
Tesla had been struggling to ramp up production of its cars including its newest Model X SUV.
Production of the Model X rose from 507 in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 2,659 in the first quarter of 2016.
The company confirmed it was on track to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 electric vehicles this year.
Tesla said it had seen demand rise across all its models, especially its Model 3 - the carmaker's first mass-market product.
Deliveries of the Model 3 are due to hit the market in 2017 and the company received 325,000 orders for the car within a week of announcing it. This could result in $14bn in future sales.
To meet that demand Tesla has cut two years off its timeline for ramping up production.
""Increasing production five-fold over the next two years will be challenging and will likely require some additional capital, but this is our goal,"" chief executive Elon Musk said in a latter to investors.
Tesla said its capital expenditure - money spent to grow the company - would probably increase by 50%.
Some investors have been concerned about Tesla's cash flow. The company has been spending money to increase its manufacturing facilities.
Though it has seen orders rise, the carmaker has yet to make a profit.
Since the start of the year Tesla has faced some production hurdles.
A shortage of parts for its Model X stalled production in January and February.
On Wednesday, Tesla announced two of its manufacturing heads were stepping down from their roles.
Greg Reichow, vice president of production will take a leave of absence as soon as a successor can be found.
Josh Ensign, vice-president of manufacturing, is also leaving the company."
"Dave Walsh, president of Liverpool Trades Council, said the council should not be afraid of setting an illegal budget.
He said: ""There's an old saying in the Labour movement, 'better to break the law than the poor'. Vulnerable people in this city are going to be left without care.""
But Mayor Joe Anderson said the council would set a legal budget.
He said: ""This city was set back 30 years ago by people setting an illegal budget. There's two options, either set a legal budget or an illegal budget.
""I'm on the side of setting a legal budget - as tough as that is.""
The council has rejected calls for the authority to ignore government spending targets and set an illegal budget.
In the 1980s, Liverpool's Labour-controlled council set an illegal budget which led to the banning of and surcharge of 47 councillors.
The council has to save £156m over the next three years, on top of £173m worth of cuts over the last three years.
The latest financial position shows that Liverpool City Council will have to save £45m in 2014-15, £63m in 2015-16 and £48m in 2016-17.

"A teenager diagnosed with a deadly brain tumour has raised $80,000 needed upfront to pay for urgent surgery. Jackson Byrnes, 18, has flown from Lismore in northern New South Wales to Sydney to be operated on by renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo, the only surgeon in Australia willing to perform the risky operation that will likely see Jackson paralysed. For the past week Jackson's family and friends have been desperately trying to raise $80,000 needed to pay the hospital upfront by Tuesday night, so that he can undergo the operation on Wednesday morning. On Monday morning they reached the target on their GoFundMe page, but Jackson's mother says the family needs an additional $45,000 to cover chemotherapy and other hospital fees. Three weeks ago the 18-year-old was told by doctors that he had a stage four brain tumour that was too deep and aggressive to be safely operated on. Jackson Byrnes, 18, has flown to Sydney for a risky operation to remove the tumour on his brain . For the past week Jackson's family and friends have been desperately trying to raise $80,000 needed to pay the hospital upfront for the risky surgery . Jackson's girlfriend Jahnae Jackson (right) noticed he had developed a lump three weeks ago and prompted him to visit a doctor who requested an MRI . His family refused to accept the dismal diagnosis and took matters into their own hands and found Dr Teo, who said he was willing to perform the operation if the family understood the risks. Jackson's mother Rhonda Byrnes said Dr Teo explained to her that  her son would most likely be paralysed down his left side. 'But he's already paralysed because the tumour is pressing down on that side of his brain, that's why we've just said go for it,' Ms Byrnes told Daily Mail Australia. 'I can't afford not to because I won't have my son around if I don't take these risks. 'Dr Teo is the best brain surgeon in the country, I've got my son's life in his hands basically.' Dr Teo, director of Sydney's Centre for Minimally Invasive Neurosurgery, said other surgeons were technically able to perform the surgery but he was the only one prepared to do it. 'People think that it's futile because he's got a malignant tumour and it's very aggressive,' Dr Teo told Daily Mail Australia. 'There's significant weakness down his left side and they think his quality of life is such that he wouldn't want to live anyway.' But Dr Teo said he makes decisions based on what his patients want. 'If a patient really wants it and knows the risks and understands how risky the operation is I'll usually respect the patient's wishes,' he said . The 18-year-old (pictured left, getting his head shaved) at a recent fundraising event . Jackson Byrnes was diagnosed with a stage four tumour three weeks ago and needed $80,000 for surgery . Jackson's mother Rhonda Byrnes said she was overwhelmed by the support and money raised by the community on his GoFundMe page, but said the family still needed more . 'He is a lovely boy and he's only young. 'I said ""You know you're going to be paralysed"", I've told him the worst case scenario. 'He understands that and he wants to live.' Dr Teo will try to remove 95 per cent of the tumour, which has extended to very sensitive part of the brain. 'If you can buy him time with surgery then the hope is you're going to get a good response to the chemotherapy and radiotherapy and a significant extension of time,' he said. 'Even if we could buy him six months of life the hope is we're going to come up with new treatment in that time.' Dr Teo said the $80,000 payment required for the surgery was standard. Jackson needs  $80,000 by Tuesday night in order to pay for his surgery upfront, and another $45,00 for fees . Renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo is the only surgeon in Australia willing to perform the risky operation that will likely see Jackson paralysed . 'I operate at a private hospital and they insist on upfront payment, you can't blame them they run it like a business,' he said. 'I don't know how much it costs I don't try and talk about the money side of things. 'But that is the cost of everything and it's also an insurance for the hospital should he get complications.' Jackson's mother Rhonda Byrnes said she was overwhelmed by the support and money raised by the community on his GoFundMe page, but said the family still needed more. 'It's amazing that we did it in four days,' Ms Byrnes told Daily Mail Australia . 'But I need more money because $80,000 is just for Dr Teo. 'The hospital fees are another $45,000 and I have to pay for MRIs and CT scans, all the radiation and chemo treatment.' Dr Teo will try to remove 95 per cent of the tumour, which has extended to very sensitive part of the brain . Taking to his Facebook fundraising page - Jackson Byrnes Brain Tumor Surgery Fund - friends of Jackson thanked the thousands of people who have made donations to the page. 'Overwhelmed with joy and gratitude,' the page posted on Monday morning. 'Thank you to everyone that contributed to this and more. Over 12K was also raised in the last week by local community.' According to the Gold Coast Bulletin, Mr Byrnes' girlfriend, Jahnae Jackson, noticed he had developed a lump  three weeks ago and prompted him to visit a doctor who requested an MRI. He was rushed to the Gold Coast for a biopsy which found a stage four tumour buried deep in the teenager's brain. Mr Byrnes was told they would not operate due to how deep the cancer was, but instead suggested chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Messages of support and promotion of the cause have flooded social media for the Casino teenager . The donations have been coming in thick and fast since the GoFundMe page was created . Knowing that this was not enough, Mr Byrnes and his family searched for a specialist who would perform the dangerous procedure. They found neurosurgeon Charlie Teo who would operate on Wednesday as long as he received an upfront payment of $80,000 by Tuesday evening. The family then turned to social media and crowd sourcing in a desperate plea for donations. 'Most boys his age begin their journey into adulthood with hopes , dreams and anticipation of what lies ahead and excitement of the endless opportunities of what life will bring them,' Mr Byrne's fundraising page on GoFundMe reads. 'It is not a time to be enduring a fight for your life.' Victorian finance, leasing and risk management company Morris Finance have made the largest donation to the cause by pledging $2000. '#savejackon has reached past the half way mark at $40,255 with two days to go,' a supporter posted on Twitter . In nine days over $76,000 was raised for the teen's surgery . Rooftech Australia, Summerland Credit Union and Alstonville Quality Meats have also donated generous sums for Mr Byrnes. Messages of support have also flooded social media for the Casino teenager. 'Thoughts and prayers going out to you Jackson, stay strong,' wrote one well wisher on the fundraising page. 'Hoping for the best possible outcome for you! Hugs from our family to yours!' wrote another. The Twitter hashtag #savejackson has also been circulating through the Casino and Lismore area."
"The 37-year-old, who had already quit one-day and Twenty20 cricket, will finish his international career on home soil, in the second of the three-match Test series against India in August.
He announced his decision during the second Test match against Pakistan in Colombo and confirmed he has opted out of the third and final match.
""This is my time to call it a day,"" he said on Saturday.

He signed for Surrey on a two-year contract in January, having previously played county cricket in England for Warwickshire and Durham."
"Stunned researchers have found one of the UK's most important manuscripts is full of ghosts. Dating from 1250, The Black Book of Carmarthen is the earliest surviving medieval manuscript written solely in Welsh, and contains some of the earliest references to Arthur and Merlin. Now, researchers have found a series of hidden faces and message in it. The Black Book of Carmarthen is the earliest surviving medieval manuscript written solely in Welsh, and contains some of the earliest references to Arthur and Merlin. Using a combination of ultraviolet light and photo editing software, the images were recovered. Dating from 1250, The Black Book of Carmarthen is the earliest surviving medieval manuscript written solely in Welsh, and contains some of the earliest references to Arthur and Merlin. The book is a collection of 9th-12th century poetry along both religious and secular lines, and draws on the traditions of the Welsh folk-heroes and legends of the Dark Ages. 'It's easy to think we know all we can know about a manuscript like the Black Book but to see these ghosts from the past brought back to life in front of our eyes has been incredibly exciting,' said Myriah Williams of Cambridge's Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic. The book is a collection of 9th-12th century poetry along both religious and secular lines, and draws on the traditions of the Welsh folk-heroes and legends of the Dark Ages. Williams and Professor Paul Russell from Cambridge's Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic (ASNC), believe that a 16th century owner of the book, probably a man named Jaspar Gryffyth, erased centuries' worth of additional verse, doodles and marginalia which had been added to the manuscript as it changed hands throughout the years. Using a combination of ultraviolet light and photo editing software, the 16th century owner's penchant for erasure has been partly reversed to reveal snatches of poetry. Currently, the texts are very fragmentary and in need of much more analysis, although they researchers say they seem to be the continuation of a poem on the preceding page with a new poem added at the foot of the page. 'The drawings and verse that we're in the process of recovering demonstrate the value of giving these books another look,' Williams said. 'The margins of manuscripts often contain medieval and early modern reactions to the text, and these can cast light on what our ancestors thought about what they were reading. 'The Black Book was particularly heavily annotated before the end of the 16th century, and the recovery of erasure has much to tell us about what was already there and can change our understanding of it.' The faces are only visible under UV light - and are invisible to the naked eye . Williams and Russell will present a lecture at The National Library of Wales today, part of a larger exhibition on the life and work of Sir John Price, one-time owner of the Black Book. There, they will detail some of their findings, stressing the importance of continued research on the manuscript. 'What we have discovered may only be the tip of the iceberg in terms of what can be discovered as imaging techniques are enhanced,' said Russell. 'The manuscript is extremely valuable and incredibly important – yet there may still be so much we don't know about it.' Despite its value today, the Black Book of Carmarthen (so called because of the colour of its binding) was not an elaborate production, but rather the work of a single scribe who was probably collecting and recording over a long period of his life. This is readily visible on the manuscript pages themselves; the first pages feature a large textura script copied on alternating ruled lines, while in other parts of the manuscript – perhaps when vellum was scarce – the hand is very much smaller and the lines per page tight and many. Measuring approximately only 17cm by 12.5 cm, the book is made up of 54 pages of vellum (animal hide) and came to the National Library of Wales in 1904 after being bought, alongside other manuscripts, by the Library's founder, Sir John Williams. An example of the latter is the earliest poem concerning the adventures of the legendary Arthur, which sees the famed hero seeking entrance to an unidentified court and expounding the virtues of his men in order to gain admittance. Other heroes are praised and lamented in a lengthy text known as Englynion y Beddau, the Stanzas of the Graves, in which a narrator presents geographic lore by claiming to know the burial places of upwards of eighty warriors. Arthur makes an appearance here as well, but only insofar as to say that he cannot be found: anoeth bid bet y arthur, 'the grave of Arthur is a wonder'. Other famous figures also appear throughout, including Myrddin, perhaps more familiarly known by the English 'Merlin'. There are two prophetic poems attributed to him during his 'wild man' phase located in the middle of the manuscript, but additionally the very first poem of the book is presented as a dialogue between him and the celebrated Welsh poet Taliesin. Since the creation of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae in the 12th century there has been a connection between Carmarthen and Merlin, and it may be no accident that the Black Book opens with this text."
"A museum in Hawaii is preparing to open a treasure-trove of artifacts from the shipwreck of a royal yacht sunk off the coast of Kauai 191 years ago. Richard Rogers, a Hawaii shipwreck chaser, worked with scientists from the Smithsonian Institution to dredge up the findings from the ship owned by King Kamehameha II, aka Liholiho, the second king of Hawaii. 'We found gold, silver, Hawaiian poi pounders, gemstones, a boat whistle, knives, forks, mica, things from all over the world, high- and low-end European stuff. Every bit of it is royal treasure,' Rogers said. Finally returned home: Artifacts that belonged to the second king of Hawaii but that sunk on a ship in 1824 are now being returned to Kauai and will go on display at the local museum. Seen here is  a cupid furniture mount that belonged to King Kamehameha II, aka Liholiho . Shipwreck: The sunken yacht, which became known as 'Pride of Hawaii', was 83-feet-long and considered the first luxury ocean-going yacht in the United States when it sunk just off Kauai in April 1824 . Sunken: This image provided by the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History  shows a diagram of the wreckage of the stern of the ship belonging to King Kamehameha II . Retrieved: Among the artifacts found by divers between 1995 and 2001 were this vegetal ivory finger ring . Rogers volunteered his time aboard his research vessel, the Pilialoha, over a five year period in four-week intervals from 1995 to 2001 to pull up the treasures. 'It's all pickled and nice and ready to be displayed,' Rogers said. 'There are over a thousand artifacts. We did our homework and this find is invaluable because it all belonged to the king. It is a fabulous window into the 1820s.' Rogers said the king's belongings were buried in 10 feet of water and 10 feet of sand. His favorite discovery was a trumpet shell. 'I found it under a bunch of sand and carried it onto the deck. This was in 1999. I blew it and it made the most beautiful sound going out over Hanalei Bay,' Rogers recalled. 'I thought about how it hadn't been blown in over 170 years.' Kamehameha II purchased the yacht from George Crowninshield II, who named it 'Cleopatra's Barge' in 1816. According to historian and Kauai Museum volunteer Zenon Wong, it cost $50,000 to build the 192 ton yacht. Rogers said it was the first luxury ocean-going yacht built in the United States. Collection: A sampling of Hawaiian artifacts found in the wreckage. At the center is the royal pu, or conch horn. Around it are ulu maika game stones, pounders, canoe breakers, and a stone rubber . Wong said reports were conflicting about the condition of the crew of the 83-foot long ship, which had been renamed Ha?aheo o Hawai?i ('Pride of Hawaii'). Some documents indicate everyone on board was drunk April 6, 1824, when the ship went aground on a shallow reef. Other historical accounts report everyone was intoxicated except the captain. The cause of the wreck is unfounded but speculation shows it may have been the combination of an unexpected wind gale and a snapped anchor cable. There are no reports that anyone died aboard the ship, which was crewed entirely by Hawaiians. The principal value of the artifacts is historical, said Paul F. Johnston, Ph.D., Curator of Maritime History at the National Museum of American History Smithsonian Institution. They represent the only known objects from the short but intense reign of Kamehameha II, the man who abolished the Hawaiian kapu (taboo) socio-cultural system and allowed Christian missionaries into the kingdom. Precious: Pictured here is a gunpowder flask found in the wreckage of a ship belonging to King Kamehameha II . 'He only reigned from 1819 -1824, but Old Hawaii changed forever and irrevocably from the changes he put into place during that short period. He was an important member of our nation's only authentic royalty,' Johnston said. The State of Hawaii owns the artifacts and loaned them to the Smithsonian for conservation and study. T . he findings were in the custody of the Smithsonian from the time of their recovery, with the exception of some artifacts going to the Underwater Conservation Lab at Texas A&M University. Those objects were returned to the Smithsonian after cataloging, conservation and stabilization. Several years ago a sampling of the artifacts were displayed at the Smithsonian. Damaged: Pictured here are fragments from Dutch case gin bottles that were on the ship . Four crates of recovered artifacts weighing nearly 1,200 pounds were delivered to The Kauai Museum in March. Two to three additional crates are scheduled for delivery and will complete the collection. Kauai Museum Director Jane Gray said she expects to open the crates soon and unveil the contents to the public after everything has been carefully unpacked."
"In a trading statement, the supermarket said its UK like-for-like sales were up 0.3% in the 13 weeks to 28 May.
For the group as a whole, including its businesses in Ireland, the European mainland and Asia, the rise was 0.9%.
Tesco also said it had agreed to sell its Harris & Hoole coffee shop chain to Caffe Nero.
In recent weeks the retailer has announced the sale of its Dobbies Garden Centres chain and restaurant chain Giraffe, so that it can focus on the main supermarket business.
Dobbies was sold to a group of investors led by Midlothian Capital Partners and Hattington Capital, while the owner of Harry Ramsden's restaurants, Boparan, snapped up Giraffe.
In April, Tesco announced its first growth in quarterly sales for three years, with UK like-for-like sales up 0.9%.
Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis said: ""We have delivered a second quarter of positive like-for-like sales growth across all parts of the group in what remains a challenging market with sustained deflation. We are encouraged by the progress we are making.""
Shares closed up 1.8% at 169.49p, bringing the rise this year to just over 12%.
Tesco also hailed the success of its new fresh food brands, with two-thirds of its customers having already tried the ranges.
""Customer ratings for the quality of our fresh food offer as a whole have improved to their highest level in more than two years,"" the supermarket said.
The fresh food ranges, launched in March, courted controversy because they were named after fictional farms with British-sounding names. However, the produce is often sourced from abroad.
""While the naming controversy provoked something of a media storm, this may have been lost on customers,"" said David Alexander, senior analyst at Verdict Retail.
""After all, the strategy is similar to that employed by Aldi and suggests that for most shoppers, the perception of provenance is sufficient, provided the products are perceived to be good value.""
Tesco and its ""big four"" peers - Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - are under continuing pressure as they face competition from discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl.
And earlier this month, online retailer Amazon launched its Amazon Fresh grocery delivery service in central and east London, with plans to roll the deliveries out further across the UK.
Since taking over as Tesco chief in September 2014, Mr Lewis has put Tesco's focus on price cuts and putting more staff in stores in an attempt to revive the company's fortunes.
As a result of its price-cutting efforts, Tesco said, the cost of a weekly shop in its supermarkets was now 6% lower than when Mr Lewis took over.
Richard Hunter, head of research at Wilson King Investment Management, said Mr Lewis was ""clearly aiming to return the stock to its former status as a market darling, an accolade which has long since disappeared"".
""Nonetheless, a number of red flags remain,"" he added.
""Ongoing investment in the business as announced at the full-year results will drag on profits, competition in the sector remains fierce and the shares are on an expensive multiple compared to its peers.
""Even so, the previously highlighted reductions in net debt and costs are complemented by strong revenue streams and there appears to be a clear line of progress emerging.
""It remains to be seen whether this new-found optimism will percolate to a share price which has dropped 22% over the last year, as compared to an 8% dip for the wider FTSE 100."""
"At least three people were shot in separate incidents in Ferguson, Missouri, on late Tuesday and early Wednesday as hundreds of demonstrators gathered in support of protests in Baltimore, a city spokesman said. Two people were shot in the neck and another was shot in the leg, spokesman Jeff Small said. There is a suspect in custody in the latter case: a 20-year-old male from St. Louis County. The two victims shot in the neck were hospitalized, Small said. ""Police are having a difficult time investigating because of the rocks being thrown at them,"" he said. ""At this point police are not sure if the (shootings are) linked to the protest or not."" St. Louis Alderman Antonio French posted video on his Twitter account.

"It appears that David Luiz has taken the phrase 'twiddling my hair' literally judging by the injured Paris Saint-Germain star's latest Instagram post. The PSG defender is out for at least four weeks after scans revealed that the 27-year-old suffered a torn hamstring in Sunday's 3-2 win at Ligue 1 title rivals Marseille. And it seems that boredom has already kicked into the usually jovial Brazilian as he sported a new hairdo on Wednesday. David Luiz posted an Instagram picture sporting a new hairdo in the style of a man bun on Wednesday .

The centre back's new look seems to be a source of amusement for his PSG team-mate Lucas Moura who later shared a picture with Luiz among his Instagram followers. 'I'll let you choose the nickname,' the midfielder wrote as he referred to Luiz's barnet later that afternoon. And while Luiz's hair may be a laughing matter to his team-mates, his injury will not be for manager Laurent Blanc as they seek Ligue 1 and Champions League glory this season.

"Trials: Researchers at Hadassah Medical School in Jerusalem found pregnancy helps regenerate tissue . Expectant mums really do bloom - for being pregnant has a 'rejuvenating effect' on women, according to new scientific research. And for older women it could help them feel young again, almost literally, as pregnancy helps regenerate tissue and slow down the ageing process, it added. Appearing to bloom is not just a cosmetic side effect of carrying a child, said medical experts for the journal Fertility and Sterility but an actual physical process. Researchers studied the effects of liver transplants on pregnant and non-pregnant mice using a high-tech MRI scanner at the Hadassah Medical School in Jerusalem. It found in young, non-pregnant mice, 82 per cent of the liver had regenerated after two days and in older, non-pregnant mice, only 46 per cent had regenerated in that time. But in older, pregnant mice around 96 per cent had regenerated after two days, better than the non-pregnant rodents both young and old, they reported. They also found that pregnancy protected the rodents from tissue damage around the heart, which is also an irreversible part of the human ageing process, said the study. Pregnancy is a unique condition for the human body, said the researchers, and as a result it has to cope with two people's systems at the same time. For the older of the two bodies, it is as if it has been injected with a youth serum from the baby it is carrying, hence the rejuvenating process affecting the mother, it suggests. The report added: 'As we age, it is more difficult for our tissue to regenerate itself. 'Because pregnancy is a unique biological model of a partially shared blood system, we have speculated that pregnancy would have a rejuvenating effect on the mother.' Tal Falick Michaeli, Rubin Chair in Medical Science at Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, who led the review, has also done research that suggests that pregnancy can restore the mother's muscles' ability to regenerate. The research found, in the mice used to test their hypothesis, that the positive effect of pregnancy was 'transient' and lasted for about two months after delivery. Serum: Say tests carried out on pregnant mice suggested they 'got youth serum injection' from babies . Previous research has also found that old mice given a transfusion of younger mice's blood performed better in a memory task than those that aged naturally. A study by Stanford University found that changes in the make-up of people's blood as they age may damage connections in the brain and so cause memory deterioration and the decline of other brain functions. This could be tackled by filtering more youthful blood into the older body, which would rejuvenate old tissue and keep nerve cells in better working order, according to the research."
"Steve Peters, the sports psychiatrist called on by a number of top stars, will play a key role in keeping troubled England batsman Jonathan Trott focused in the Caribbean. Trott has made a nightmare return to the Test side 18 months since situational anxieties saw him quit the Ashes tour — falling cheaply in both innings in the first Test in Antigua and finding his ‘on the move’ batting technique under strong scrutiny. It is understood that Trott is having regular Skype sessions with Peters from the team hotel, and he credits the psychiatrist with helping him overcome his mental health issues to win his Test place back. Jonathan Trott has endured a nightmare return to Test cricket with some poor performances in the first Test . But the double failure will be a big challenge for Trott, with Peters’s assistance, to continue ‘to keep a proper prospective on life and cricket’ which he said he was doing before the Test, rather than having ‘unrealistic expectations about his batting,’ which he had in Australia. Peters, whose other clients include the England football team, Liverpool, British Cycling and snooker’s Ronnie O’Sullivan, will no doubt be telling Trott to manage his inner chimp — the part of the brain that runs on emotions and gut instincts in contrast to the rational, evidence-based part. Despite his success with multi-Olympic champions Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton, Peters didn’t do anything to improve England during their dismal 2014 football World Cup but is still involved on an ad hoc basis. Steve Peters (right) worked with the England football team during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . The England team under Peter Moores have a more relaxed attitude towards the players’ use of social media than previous regimes. All-rounder Ben Stokes took to Twitter, after taking a wicket with a no-ball in the West Indies first innings, to comment: ‘Tweets about the no-ball flooding in, so tomorrow I won’t try, bowl four feet behind the line and bowl 70 mph... then you’re all happy’. Despite the provocative tweet, for which he later apologised, the England camp had no complaint. Instead they were pleased that one of the players had showed some character.

Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove’s biggest ambition in cricket is to see an Ashes Test match at his beloved Ageas Bowl ground, which he was mainly responsible for building and funding.

And ironically ECB representative Bransgrove has been watching the first Test in Antigua alongside former ECB chairman David Morgan, highly influential in Hampshire rivals Glamorgan hosting Ashes games in 2009 and 2015. And since Bransgrove was one of Giles Clarke’s major opponents during his autocratic ECB reign, that didn’t help Hampshire’s chances either. Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove (left) wants to see an Ashes Test match at the Ageas Bowl ground . Peter Salmon, director of BBC England, made a surprise appearance in the Test Match Special booth at the Sir Vivian Richards stadium. However, Salmon had not flown out to the Caribbean at licence fee payers’ expense, just to check whether Joe Wilson’s hard-working BBC sports team were giving value for money. He happened to be on holiday in Antigua. SIR VIV: THIS IS SURREAL . Coming across Sir Vivian Richards, King of Antigua, having a moment alone surveying the Test match scene, Sports Agenda asked him what it was like, watching cricket at a ground named after you and where your statue stands. ‘It’s surreal,’ said Richards. ‘You have to pinch yourself.’ The striking Richards statue, by acclaimed Cuban sculptor Andres Gonzalez, was funded by Fidel Castro’s Cuban government to mark 20 years of diplomatic accord between the two islands. Meanwhile, England’s intense batting coach Mark Ramprakash is taking a surprising interest in Cuban politics.

"After being reduced to 8-2, they posted a score of 255-7, with Davies and Ben Foakes (90) sharing a stand of 130.
Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance.
Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236.
Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002.
They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover.
But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary.
Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes.
After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning.
Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining.
Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London:
""Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires, everybody's pulling together.
""Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent, that partnership blew the game wide open.
""The position we got ourselves to, I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270.
""But we got wickets at the right times and it was always going to be an uphill battle for them once it got down to those final overs.""
Yorkshire captain Alex Lees:
""We are all gutted. We have played some great white-ball cricket this season, but when it has mattered we haven't been good enough.
""The bowlers were exceptional and we thought it was a reachable target. We needed someone in the top five to make a contribution and we would have reached the target comfortably."""
"The English 16-time world champion beat the Belgian 4-2 at Alexandra Palace.
Taylor will meet five-time world champion Van Barneveld for the fourth time at the tournament.
Dutch top seed Michael van Gerwen beat England's Darren Webster 4-1 while Scottish third seed Peter Wright beat England's Ian White by the same score.
Taylor battled back from behind in each of the opening three sets to lead 3-0, only to see 13th seed Huybrechts narrow the gap to 3-2.
But the fourth seed survived the spirited comeback, sealing victory at the second opportunity in the sixth set to tee up the meeting with long-time rival Van Barneveld on Friday.
Taylor has won two of their three previous encounters at the event, with Van Barneveld prevailing 7-6 in an epic 2007 final.
Fellow Dutchman Van Gerwen was pushed by Webster - who was the lowest-ranked player left in the competition - in the first two sets, then took the third without dropping a leg.
Webster, 46 from Norwich, arguably raised the biggest cheer of the night when he held off the Dutchman to win the fourth set.
Both players came close to nine-dart checkouts in the fifth set, with Van Gerwen punishing his opponent's inability to complete the feat by sealing victory with his next throw.
In Thursday's afternoon session, sixth seed James Wade twice fought back from two-set deficits to beat fellow Englishman Michael Smith 4-3.
Smith raced into a 2-0 advantage and then led 3-1 before Wade clinched victory by winning seven straight legs.
England's Dave Chisnall reached the quarter-finals for the first time as he held off Dutchman Jelle Klaasen to earn a 4-2 victory.

"Supported by American intelligence and supplied with advanced U.S.-made weaponry, Saudi jets began airstrikes in Yemen late last month in the name of what the kingdom's Washington ambassador described as ""restoring the legitimate government"" and protecting a ""Yemeni constitution and elections."" The need to protect constitutions and elections is a rather strange message from the representative of an absolute monarchy. Indeed, Saudi motives in Yemen likely have nothing to do with protecting the country's ""legitimate government,"" its constitution or its electoral process. So what is really going on? The kingdom's real motives seem clear if one looks at Saudi monarchy's history of not allowing regional competition of any kind, while consistently combating efforts to build democratic governments that empower the people. This approach was evident in 2013, when Saudi Arabia voiced its support for the military coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of Mohamed Morsy in Egypt, which was in keeping with counterrevolutionary Saudi policies that aimed to contain or reverse the results of the Arab Spring. The Saudi goal is simple: Prevent the rise of any popularly supported government in the region that seeks self-determination. And the excuse of ""resisting Iran's influence,"" meanwhile, appears to be nothing but sectarian bluster. For example, in 2009, the Houthis (more accurately described as the Ansarullah) were not yet receiving help from Iran, yet for weeks the kingdom pummeled them with airstrikes, following Saudi claims of a Houthi incursion. True, the Ansarullah movement now benefits from Iranian support. But it is far from the only group getting help from outside sources in the region. With all this in mind, the American decision to stand behind the Saudi attack on Yemen can best be described as misguided. Although the Houthi movement's rhetoric is unquestionably anti-American, it has not targeted any American interests. In fact, when the U.S. Embassy packed up in Sanaa in January, leaving a fleet of over 20 armored SUVs behind at the airport, the Houthis reportedly said they would round up the cars and deliver them to a U.N. representative in Yemen. And while the Houthis did not welcome the American presence in Yemen, they did not interfere with U.S. operations against al Qaeda in the country. But one of the biggest miscalculations has been that U.S. policy has adopted the Saudi-Gulf narrative on Yemen, effectively placing Saudi ambitions to control Yemen above previous American priorities like destroying the safe haven for al Qaeda there. Indeed, the Obama administration appears to have abandoned Yemen to Saudi machinations. This reality was underscored when U.S State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki effectively endorsed Saudi bombing, saying the ""Saudis have legitimate concerns about the possible impact of current events in Yemen on their security."" The implication here seems to be that any country ""concerned"" about its neighbors can go ahead and bomb them, a view that risks creating a dangerous precedent. Back in September, White House spokesman Josh Earnest described Yemen as a success story in the war on terrorism, explaining that the U.S. priority in Yemen was not to establish a ""Jeffersonian democracy"" but to prevent Yemen from becoming a safe-haven for al Qaeda and affiliates. Yet if that policy goal remains in place, then it must be acknowledged that the Saudi war on Yemen will not only undermine the U.S. aim of preventing al Qaeda from making Yemen a safe haven, but also undermine broader U.S. efforts in Yemen. The reality is that Saudi and Gulf Co-operation Council jets are effectively acting as al Qaeda's air force by bombing the same group that had managed to uproot al Qaeda from several Yemeni regions. Interestingly, while Saudi Arabia deployed about 100 aircraft against the Houthis on the second day of its offensive, it reportedly deployed a mere four fighter jets in the early U.S.-led campaign against ISIS last year. Regardless, the results of the Saudi campaign are unlikely to be positive -- one only need look at the way a much smaller Houthi force than today was able to outfox the Saudi military back in 2009. Back then, Houthi forces consisted of only a few hundred fighters, but they shocked the Saudi army, reportedly capturing Saudi equipment and forcing the evacuation of almost 250 Saudi villages as it seized territory along the border. Today, that ragtag group of Houthi rebels has been replaced by a much larger group called Ansarullah, modeled after Lebanon's Hezbollah. Back in 2009, the rebels were limited to parts of the Saada region and were self-funded, although Yemen claimed they had minor assistance from the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Yet despite this, they were still able to withstand some 90 days of Saudi bombardment. Today, the Ansarullah group is receiving political, financial and military support from Iran. Already, the Saudi government was forced to cancel flights to southern airports, and it has also reportedly suspended classes in schools in the border regions. The situation is only likely to deteriorate as the fighting continues. What should be done now? Saudi interests in Yemen should not replace those of the United States. With this in mind, the Obama administration should work to find an immediate political solution to the conflict, one that can be embraced by the various Yemeni factions. A change in approach is essential not only because the Saudi-led war on Yemen is wrong and destined to fail, but because it might end up further opening the Yemeni door to Iran. But perhaps most importantly, by supporting a self-interested Saudi campaign, the U.S. may actually empower an al Qaeda with the potential still to do great harm to the United States."

Saints captain Anderson claims he was punched by Kiernan during last week's 1-1 draw between the sides.

The Scottish FA disciplinary hearing regarding the incident at McDiarmid Park will take place on 12 January.
Anderson said that Kiernan, who was free to play in Saturday's defeat by Celtic, deserved any punishment that may arise from the incident.
""You can't do that in football games,"" he said. ""I'm not bothered, but if it gets highlighted then he deserves it.""
Rangers manager Mark Warburton, however, defended Kiernan.
""There's nothing in that,"" he said. ""I've watched it again - it's a push.
""If you punish that, there will be more judicial panels than you could possibly imagine."""
"Nicola Sturgeon today threatened to 'change the direction' of the UK parliament without even becoming an MP as the SNP stepped up its demands on Labour. The SNP leader insisted she would call the shots in the event of a hung parliament, even though she is not even standing for election to the Commons. And she vowed to use the influence of dozens of MPs to get her way for the next five years without voting down the government. Scroll down for video . SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, pictured today in Kilmarnock, insisted she would call the shots in the event of a hung parliament, even though she is not even standing for election to the Commons . Ms Sturgeon said that Mr Miliband will 'have to reflect how people have voted and they will have to on a practical level be prepared to talk to others and compromise with others in order to get their policies through' Ms Sturgeon has made clear she would act to 'lock' the Tories out of power and prop up a Labour government. The SNP have enjoyed a surge in popularity since September's referendum on independence, despite 55 per cent of people voting stay in the UK. A new opinion poll by TNS puts the SNP on 54 per cent, up two points on two weeks ago, with Labour down two points to 22 per cent. Labour now faces the prospect of near-wipeout north of the border, robbing Ed Miliband of his chances of an overall majority. However, Ms Sturgeon has made clear she would act to 'lock' the Tories out of power and prop up a Labour government. Both sides have ruled out a formal coalition, and yesterday Mr Miliband said he had 'made it clear we're not interested' in deals, such as a 'confidence and supply' arrangement where the SNP would agree to back Labour on important votes such as the Budget. But Ms Sturgeon insists that after polling day, Labour will be forced to do as she says. 'Ed Miliband can say what he wants right now, he's entitled to do so, but he can't deny reality,' she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'If there is a situation after the election where neither of the big parties has a majority they will have to reflect how people have voted and they will have to on a practical level be prepared to talk to and compromise with others in order to get their policies through. 'Now, whether that's as part of a formal deal, or on an issue-by-issue basis it gives parties like the SNP enormous clout and enormous influence.' A new opinion poll by TNS puts the SNP on 54 per cent, up two points on two weeks ago, with Labour down two points to 22 per cent . Support for the SNP has soared since the independence referendum in September, when 55 per cent of people voted against leaving the UK . Labour leader Ed Miliband, arriving at the Arc Arts Centre in Stockton-on-Tees with local candidate Louise Baldock, said he had 'made it clear we're not interested' in deals, such as a 'confidence and supply' arrangement where the SNP would agree to back Labour on important votes such as the Budget . A briefing by Lord Mandelson's company suggests the SNP will be the real winners of the election . The SNP will emerge as the winners from the general election whatever happens on May 7, Peter Mandelson's firm has warned. Global Counsel, the consultancy chaired by the former Labour Cabinet minister, warns Labour will be pulled to the left if SNP calls the shots. 'Labour may be wary of the SNP, because it knows an arrangement with the party could annoy some English voters, but it may have little choice if it is to form the next government,' the company said in a pre-election briefing. Analyst Gregor Irwin says the SNP will have 'maximum leverage' soon after the election and will seek to 'pull the Labour party to the left, away from the centre ground of English politics'. 'This will include pushing Labour towards higher public spending,' he adds. The company has made clear that the document are the personal views of Mr Irwin, a former chief economist to the foreign office. She insisted that she will lead any talks with the next UK government, despite the fact that she is not standing as an MP. Angus Robertson is currently the SNP leader in Westminster, while Alex Salmond – who is set to return to the Commons – had also been viewed as a potential powerbroker. Ms Sturgeon made clear that she will be in charge: 'I am the leader of the SNP and therefore if there are discussions to be had after the election, I will lead those. 'I am the leader of the SNP and people voting SNP know that and I don't think are under any illusions about that.' Polls continue to suggest that neither Labour or the Tories will get an overall majority, leaving them to rely on smaller parties to form a government. Ms Sturgeon said that Mr Miliband will 'have to reflect how people have voted and they will have to on a practical level be prepared to talk to others and compromise with others in order to get their policies through'. She added: 'Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act it is possible for other parties to change the direction of a government without bringing a government down. That gives enormous influence.' The SNP leader rejected the suggestion that her party was more austere than Labour, insisting 'every single penny' had been passed on from grants to the health service. Ms Sturgeon said: 'We are putting forward as part of our anti-austerity argument the fact we would vote for considerable increases in health spending across the UK to meet the terms of the Stevens Report and ensure as we go into the next decade the health service is properly equipped to face up to the challenges it will meet.' She added: 'As long as Westminster decisions affect Scotland it matters to the SNP and it matters to Scotland that those decisions are good decisions, to we have a vested interest in making sure the politics at Westminster is better politics.' Tory Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: 'When Ed Miliband's biggest union paymaster is saying that he will be forced to do deals with the SNP, it's no surprise that Nicola Sturgeon knows she will be pulling Ed Miliband's strings if he gets into Downing Street. 'Working people will pay the price for an Ed Miliband government that's propped up by the SNP – through more debt, more borrowing and more taxes.' Green Party leader Natalie Bennett has had to pull out of her party’s housing policy campaign launch after losing her voice . Green Party leader Natalie Bennett has had to pull out of her party’s housing policy campaign launch after losing her voice. Ms Bennett - who had been due to set out her party’s plans to control rents during a visit to a south London housing estate - was said to be “resting” ahead of her battle bus launch tomorrow. Earlier she dismissed suggestions that Labour had stole their thunder, dismissing their proposals as a “watered down” version of what the Greens are offering. She told BBC Breakfast: “We need to move away from thinking of homes primarily as financial assets and go back to thinking they are safe places for people to live.” The Greens would also abolish right to buy, she said, and build 500,000 social homes on brownfield sites over the course of the next parliament. The party would link a cap on annual rent increases to the consumer price index, as part of a package of measures to make the private rented sector fairer for tenants. It is also calling for a Living Rent Commission to investigate ways to bring rent levels down. Ms Bennett said: “At the moment, the private rental market is structured in a way that benefits landlords over tenants, and treats homes as investment vehicles. “As more people rent, rather than own, their homes, it is vital that we correct this imbalance. “Keeping rent rises in line with inflation will reduce poverty and allow tenants a better standard of living. We also need to look in to all options for cutting rent. That’s why we’re calling for a Living Rent Commission to tackle our housing crisis.” It is not the first time the Greens’ campaign plans have gone awry - the party twice had to postpone a poster launch while earlier this year Ms Bennett suffered a “brain fade” during a radio interview in which she struggled to explain her party’s policies."

And for Real boss Carlo Ancelotti he now faces the enviable dilemma of trying to fit in his array of stars into his starting line-up.

For the first time since November midfield quartet Isco, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and James Rodriguez are all fit and available alongside famed 'BBC' triumvirate of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo. Marca also recognises this issue at the Santiago Bernabeu. Leading with the headline 'Blessed Problem,' the publication states that Ancelotti will have to choose between either Isco or Rodriguez to finalise his best starting line-up. The Madrid-based paper further adds that the latter is the favourite due to his impressive stats in his debut season at Real to date. In all competitions so far, the 23-year-old has scored 12 goals and provided 11 assists in comparison to Isco's five and six. Over in Italy, the fallout at the demise of giants Inter continues with Corriere dello Sport reporting that there is a huge divide between Italian and foreign playing and non-playing staff.

As it stands, PSG sit top of Ligue 1 with 62 points after 31 games - just one ahead of second-placed Lyon and five ahead of Marseille in third. In France, L'Equipe reports that PSG's 3-2 win at Marseille is an indictment at the improvement of Ligue 1 ."

"Young father: Michael Owen was preparing for his daughter's fifth birthday when he was killed along with his friend Kyle Careford in East Sussex . Tributes have been paid to two young friends who tragically died after their car crashed into a church wall. The men, named locally as Michael Owen and Kyle Careford, were killed in the road accident in Crowborough, East Sussex in the early hours of Sunday morning. Mr Owen, 21, had just received news of a  job offer and was preparing for his daughter's fifth birthday when he was killed. His grieving family have spoken of how loved he was and say they still can't accept he's gone. Describing Mr Owen's relationship with his daughter Lily-Rose Iris, his father Stephen, 50, said: 'He was only 16 when he had her but he was responsible and loved her to bits. 'He was with her any second he could be. He was always so safe. Did something fail on the car or did they hit the curb?' Mr Owen's stepmother Sylvia added: 'Everybody loved him. He had so many friends and everyone's absolutely devastated. 'He was a lovely person and he was a brilliant father. 'Until we see him we can't accept it. We keep getting up in the night and looking for his car down the road.' Kyle Careford, the other man in the car, is thought to have died just days before turning 21. It is believed that one of the men lost control of the Renault Clio they were travelling in as it came round a bend, smashing into a church's stone wall before finishing on its roof. Skid marks lead up to an approximately ten metre long gap in a sandstone wall that was destroyed in the crash. Flowers and tributes have been left at the scene by family and friends. One heartbreaking card to Mr Owen reads: 'To daddy, I love you so much. I'm gonna miss you every day. Love u daddy. Lily and Josh.' Mr Owen was still at school when he fathered Lily-Rose with his former partner Lauren Molloy. A card signed by Lauren, believed to be Lily-Rose's mother Ms Molloy, read: 'I can't describe how heartbroken I am. I love you so much and so does our beautiful princess.

The brother of Mr Careford led tributes to the pair. In a card left at the scene, brother Ben wrote: 'I can't explain how I am feeling. When you left us this morning to be in God's arms you took a piece of me away. 'I'm not quite sure how to tell your niece Grace that her uncle Kyle is now in heaven. I'm sure he will treasure her Frozen onesie even more now.' Tributes have also been paid to the men on Facebook, with friend, Tyler Scales, writing: 'My deepest sympathy and thoughts go out to all those who have loved and lost. 'Be safe, and think about how lucky you really are. Life can be taken so quick it's unbelievable and very unfair. Big love to all those affected by the loss of life.' Another friend, Sheri Pitman added: 'RIP Kyle. You were such a good kid and never deserved that.' Both men were from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, not far from the crash scene. Moving: One of the many notes left by grieving friends and family at the scene of the crash .

"Philippe Coutinho is becoming Liverpool's go-to guy and is picking up where Luis Suarez left off last season, believes Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher. Coutinho starred for Liverpool in their 2-0 win against Newcastle United on Monday night and managed five shots against goalkeeper Tim Krul, though he could not nab himself a goal. Liverpool sold Suarez to Barcelona for £75million during the summer, but Carragher feels Coutinho can fill the sizable gap left by the controversial Uruguay striker.

Liverpool sold star striker Luis Suarez to Barcelona for £75million during the summer . 'The role he played tonight was the false nine we speak about a lot,' Carragher told Sky Sports after the Barclays Premier League match. 'We expect him in a wide area, but we saw some of his touches tonight and his ability in small spaces against players, some of the pieces of play he produced tonight. 'Last season Luis Suarez was Liverpool's main man, the go-to man. But as this season has progressed, and for the future, Coutinho is Liverpool's.'

Mr Johnston served for seven years with Australia's Army Reserves before going travelling and becoming moved by the struggle of ethnic Kurds against IS militants, who have taken control of large parts of Syria of Iraq. His body finally arrived home in Canberra last week, leaving Mrs Johnston to face the grim task of identifying him. She reportedly slapped her son's body when she saw him and then kissed him on the face. According to a family member, his mother would not have supported his choice to fight with the Kurdish people in Syria.

'It cannot be emphasised enough that although Ashley did not die for Australia, Ashley did die fighting for values that we Australians call our own,' she told the service. It is believed Mr Johnston's family will hold a private burial in Canberra. It is still a mystery to them how Mr Johnston made connections in the Kurdish community in Syria.

"Wakefield coach James Webster explained how tough his club were finding life after their 80-0 First Utility Super League thrashing by Warrington Wolves. The Wildcats are rooted to the foot of the table after eight consecutive defeats. The rout saw a hat-trick of tries by Wolves' Richie Myler and a 28-point haul for Stefan Ratchford. Gene Ormsby claimed two tries along with Toby King and Ben Currie. The other tries came from Daryl Clark, Ashton Sims, Ben Westwood, Ben Currie and Joel Monaghan. Wakefield Wildcats coach James Webster said after the game he does not have enough players . Webster said: 'Over six weeks now we haven't had a seven-day turnaround and we find it hard to find some energy. 'I hate looking for excuses but over the last month I think we have spent around two hours as a team training together, for the simple reason I don't have enough people to fulfil training. 'There are no ifs and buts about that — I just don't have enough players. 'We trained for half an hour on our last run as a team simply because we need all our players playing or we will not fulfil our fixtures.' Regarding the defeat to Wolves he added: 'We were totally outclassed. Full credit to Warrington they were outstanding.' The Wildcats now face a Challenge Cup tie against Championship outfit Halifax on Friday night."
"Andrew Travers left the authority by ""mutual agreement"" after the error, officials said.
Voters were initially turned away from all 155 polling stations in the borough because their names were missing from the poll list.
An independent investigation has been launched, the council said.
In a statement issued through the council, Mr Travers said: ""I have enjoyed my time at Barnet and I believe the changes we have put in place and the continued programme of growth and transformation will enable the borough to continue to thrive.""
A council spokesperson said Mr Travers had ""made a valuable contribution to the council during his three and half years as chief executive.""
Deputy chief executive John Hooton will take over temporarily while longer term arrangements are put in place, the council said.
On election day, staff at one station said just three of the first 30 voters to show up were on the register. The rest were told to come back later.
Barnet Council apologised for the problems and later offered emergency proxy votes to residents who had been affected.
But voters in the area questioned how the result could be ""fair"" when not everyone was able to have their say at the ballot box.
A statement released by Mr Travers on Thursday blamed electoral registration lists for the problems.
The council's review will conclude by the end of May and the findings will be presented publicly to the General Functions Committee.
It will look at the ""appropriateness"" of arrangements in place for the EU Referendum in June.
A spokesman said it was currently in discussions to establish who would lead the investigation."
"Rory McIlroy will tee off his bid to become just the sixth man to win golf's Grand Slam alongside Phil Mickelson and Ryan Moore at Augusta National on Thursday. The Northern Irishman will be joined over the first two rounds by three-time Masters champion Mickelson and another mercurial American in Moore in what promises to be an electric three-ball when they tee off at 3.41pm BST. But all eyes will be trained on Tiger Woods among the later starters, as the four-time green jacket winner returns to action for the first time since February alongside two stars of last year's Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, Jamie Donaldson and Jimmy Walker.

The 14-time major champion is bidding to win his fifth green jacket, but has been plagued by a succession of injuries and even the chipping yips in recent times. The world will find out which version of Woods will turn up when he tees off in the penultimate group at 6.48pm. Defending champion Bubba Watson, hoping to win his third Masters title in four years, will tee off at 2.24pm alongside England's former US Open champion Justin Rose and 21-year-old South Korean amateur Gunn Yang, who earned the right to play in the prestigious group by winning the US Amateur last year. Those watching the 2.02pm group on Thursday could see some fireworks as two of the game's most colourful characters go head-to-head. Ian Poulter could hardly be described as a shrinking violet, but even he might meet his match in American young gun Patrick Reed, who earned himself a brash reputation by professing himself to be among the top five players in the world after his big win at Doral last year. He followed that up by shushing the home crowd during a cocksure display at Gleneagles. Three-time Masters champion Phil MIckelson, hitting from behind trees during practice, will play alongside McIlroy in the first two rounds . Ryan Moore, pictured during a practice round at Augusta, will join McIlroy and Mickelson on the course for round one and two . Woods will be accompanied with Wales' Jamie Donaldson and Jimmy Walker of the USA during the first two rounds of the competition . US Open champion Martin Kaymer is in the group behind world No 1 McIlroy, with Brandt Snedeker and Houston Open winner JB Holmes. McIlroy and Mickelson were among the players battling for the US PGA title in near-darkness at Valhalla last year, with Mickelson and Rickie Fowler stepping aside on the 18th to allow the final group of McIlroy and Bernd Wiesberger to tee off and beat the fading light. With 98 players in the field, Charley Hoffman and Brian Harman make up the first group out in the tournament proper at 12.45pm (7:45am local time), with Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus again acting as honorary starters five minutes earlier, the legendary duo hitting tee shots on the par-four first before retiring to the clubhouse while Arnold Palmer takes up a similar role but is unable to tee off as he is recovering from a dislocated shoulder. England's Danny Willett will begin his Masters debut in the second group at 12:56pm alongside 1987 winner Larry Mize and US amateur public links champion Byron Meth. Woods faces a lengthy wait before he can begin his bid for a fifth Masters title after being drawn in the penultimate group for the opening round. The American superstar has started just two events in 2015, carding a career-worst 82 to miss the cut in the first and withdrawing through injury after 11 holes of the second, but said he was ready to 'compete to win a golf tournament' after 11 holes of practice on Monday. The final group tees off at 1:59pm and features three players ranked in the top 13 in the world, Australia's Jason Day, Spain's Sergio Garcia and Fowler. Fowler finished in the top five in all four majors last year."
"It was always going to be a highly charged farewell, after 112 years, to this football bastion of east London and the one consolation was that at least no-one was seriously injured.
This was a hugely significant fixture for the visitors too, Louis van Gaal and his players arriving with their fate in their own hands but little margin for error.
They knew victory here, amid a heady mix of nostalgia and fierce hostility, would leave them needing only to beat Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Sunday to secure Champions League football.
Instead, a 3-2 loss leaves them still needing that win against the Cherries - but now requiring that neighbours Manchester City lose at Swansea.
Media playback is not supported on this device
As a fleet of London taxis brought a succession of West Ham greats on to the Boleyn Ground turf for the big finish to the farewell party, several cynics suggested one cab was on order to ferry Van Gaal away from Manchester United.
It has been obvious since Christmas that there has been no great appetite inside Old Trafford to replace Van Gaal - if United were certain he was not the man for the job, former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho could have already been occupying his office or at least officially lined up.
Even in the hours before this loss at West Ham, Van Gaal's position appeared to be gaining strength with the supposed loss of 18-year-old transfer target Renato Sanches to Bayern Munich in a £27.6m deal.
It was later suggested United had not missed out but that Van Gaal had actually vetoed the deal - and why would the club let him do that if he was not going to be in charge next season? The fact that Sanches' agent is Jorge Mendes, who would love to see his client Mourinho installed at Old Trafford, only added to the perceived political intrigue.

One way Van Gaal could have strengthened his position even further would have been a win at West Ham that would have made United firm favourites to beat City to fourth place in the Premier League, with the potential bonus of an FA Cup final victory over Crystal Palace in May.
Indeed, so buoyed was Van Gaal by the sudden upturn in his position that he was even able to point out to the media that they were finally posing tactical questions before a game rather than asking about his possible sacking.
And for four tantalising second-half minutes it all seemed on for Van Gaal. Antony Martial's brilliance had turned the game, undeservedly on its balance, in United's favour with two goals. At 2-1 up, they were 14 minutes from a win that could have offered the opportunity to put a different spin on their season.
It was not to be. Old vulnerabilities quickly returned and saw United beaten by two headed goals from Michail Antonio and Winston Reid - leaving Van Gaal back on the rack. The players dragged their manager out of a hole then threw him back in again.
The intention may still be to keep him next season but that decision would have been made a lot easier and more palatable with victory. Now it all goes on the line again on Sunday - but with Manchester City at the controls.
The equation is simple. Manchester United must beat Bournemouth and hope Manchester City lose at Swansea - and therein lies that sliver of hope for the 64-year-old Dutch coach.
City have been so unreliable, unpredictable and uninspired at times this season that you would not risk too much on the certainty of Manuel Pellegrini's side getting the job done.
Of course City will be favourites and only need a point - but they are not a team to be trusted, as seen in their heavy defeat at Southampton and disappointing draw at home to Arsenal in their last two Premier League games.
And after beating Liverpool 3-1 and, more impressively, thrashing West Ham 4-1 at Upton Park on Saturday, Swansea are also running into the sort of relaxed good form that makes them dangerous opponents.
Confidence has been renewed to such an extent that head coach Francesco Guidolin is expected to be confirmed on a new contract after a Swansea board meeting on Wednesday.
City can be fragile and United will hope that vulnerability haunts them one last time.
And then all it needs is for United to beat Bournemouth - but United cannot be trusted either.
Manchester United's players may have been affected by an arduous coach journey that ended in such disgraceful scenes outside Upton Park - and West Ham co-owner David Sullivan's dismissive response that the visitors should simply have arrived earlier did no credit to him or his club on this landmark night.
The kick-off was delayed by 45 minutes but there was still no excuse for a tepid Manchester United first half that lacked urgency, organisation and anything that would be reasonably expected with stakes so high.
They were lucky to only trail to Diafra Sakho's early goal, their defence going missing in its entirety shortly afterwards when Andy Carroll raced clear only to shoot straight at David de Gea.
It was as if Van Gaal had not impressed upon his players that a door to the Champions League that had looked shut for so long was suddenly ajar. Instead it looked like meaningless, end-of-season stuff.
The superb Martial offered brief hope, the normally passive Van Gaal leaping from his seat to punch the air - but the joy did not last long as the visitors' vulnerability in defence was exposed. They simply could not cope with West Ham's pressure.
For long spells this was a performance that made you question how such an ordinary side could even be in contention for a top-four place. They were that poor.
True, they missed the aerial strength of suspended Marouane Fellaini, who operated with such success to not only combat the likes of Carroll but also score when Manchester United won 2-1 at Upton Park in the FA Cup quarter-final replay.
In the final reckoning, however, this defeat was deserved after a display that produced much of the evidence that has left so many United fans questioning Van Gaal's future.
Van Gaal will still believe his side can reach the Champions League but the odds are against them now so he may well end up looking to the FA Cup for success.
If United win he will undoubtedly paint this as progress - and he will have a point as it would be the club's first major trophy since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.
It may not be enough, however, to suggest Van Gaal is pointing United in the right direction, despite his willingness to play youth with the emergence of 18-year-old Marcus Rashford and the signing of 20-year-old Antony Martial - who increasingly looks like a bargain at £36m from Monaco.
Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward clearly wants his man to succeed and his thoughts on the future remain a mystery but there is no doubt an FA Cup win is a much harder sell than an FA Cup win and Champions League football.

"Such is the global sporting fame of Andy Murray that guests attending the star's wedding to Kim Sears this weekend might have wondered if they would be seated next to a famous face. Novak Djokovic perhaps? Or fellow Scotsman Alex Ferguson? The answer is a resounding 'not likely'. When Murray, 27, says 'I do' with his long-term girlfriend, also 27, on April 11, the guests wishing them well in his hometown of Dunblane will be largely a gathering of close family and friends. Low-key: In spite of high profile friendships with the likes of James Corden, Andy Murray and bride-to-be, Kim Sears (pictured here when Murray received his OBE in 2013) haven't invited many big names to attend their wedding in Dumblane this weekend .

Buy now . Murray's status as one of the world's best tennis players means he has mixed with everyone from A-list celebrities such as James Corden to the Prime Minister and even the Queen. But the biggest name likely to be in attendance at Dunblane Cathedral, where the couple are tying the knot, is one-time British tennis star Tim Henman. Indeed, when the sport's world number one, Novak Djokovic, was asked by a journalist recently if he would be attending the celebration, he replied with a curt: 'Not invited', before following up with a more charitable: 'But I wish him all the best.' As one of Murray's fiercest rivals on the court, it's not surprising Djokovic isn't at the top of the guest list but it seems that, unlike a lot of famous faces, the couple have taken a more low-key approach when it comes to who to invite. Murray has said: 'There won't be any celebrities as such. 'I don't have any celebrity friends so it wasn't something that was planned. '[It'll be] Everyone who we're close to, people we've spent a lot of time with in the past but also people we see ourselves spending time with in the future. 'That's how we came up with the names. Pretty much everything is done now and under control. I'm sure a few things will come up next week but it's pretty much sorted.' Who made the list? British player Jamie Delgado (left) is a close friend of Murray's but celebrity pals such as James Corden (right), who admittedly may well have other fish to fry in the US, won't be attending . There will be names from the tennis world in attendance but certainly not players who are as well known as the likes of Nadal or Federer. Murray has invited Dutch doubles player Jules Rojer, who he spends time with while training in Miami and Davis Cup team mate James Ward. Another British pro Jamie Delgado will also attend. Bride-to-be Kim was spotted cheering on her fiancé this weekend as he battled Novak Djokovic in the men's final at the Miami Open before the couple fly back to Scotland ahead of their nuptials. For the 27-year-old’s many fans and friends in the town, it means at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport, played out on the streets of the community. It is understood local residents and businesses urged the former Wimbledon champion to hold the April 11 service at the cathedral rather than at luxury hotel Cromlix House in nearby Kinbuck – so they too could toast his big day. The reception will be held at Cromlix, which Murray owns. There's a friendly rivalry on court between Andy Murray and tennis world number one Novak Djokovic but the Serbian won't be attending Murray's nuptials this weekend . Lady in waiting: Kim Sears watched her husband-to-be lose to Novak Djokovic in the Miami Open in Key Biscayne, Florida last weekend. Hundreds of well-wishers are expected to welcome the couple as they arrive at Dunblane Cathedral, before Andy and Kim hold their wedding reception at luxury hotel Cromlix House . The 300-seat, 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at Cromlix, which seats only 28. Thousands are expected to line Dunblane High Street on the day. Murray’s uncle Niall Erskine said: ‘I’m sure it will be a popular decision, as he’s had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past. Andy has admitted that, food aside, he's left much of the preparation for the big day to his betrothed: 'Kim’s been pretty much doing it' 'I’ve tried to help out when she has asked, but I haven’t been over-involved. I did all the food and cake tasting which I really enjoyed, although I didn’t think I was going to. He added: 'It’s a big day for Kim. Pretty much everything is taken care of now. She seems fairly relaxed but as we get closer that might change.'"
"The apology came as an independent panel found police ""sought to deflect responsibility"" on to Liverpool fans.
Chief Constable David Crompton has confirmed statements were altered seeking to lessen police blame.
""I think that if people are shown to have acted criminally then they should face prosecution,"" he said.
Mr Crompton made his apology after previously unseen government papers about the Hillsborough disaster in April 1989 were released.
The documents indicate, for the first time, that South Yorkshire Ambulance Service documents were amended after the disaster, the panel said.
The chief constable accepted they also show South Yorkshire Police (SYP) had failed the victims and families on the day of the disaster and the police lost control.
""In the immediate aftermath senior officers sought to change the record of events,"" Mr Crompton said.
""Disgraceful lies were told which blamed the Liverpool fans for the disaster.  These actions have caused untold pain and distress for over 23 years.
""I am profoundly sorry for the way the force failed.""
However, Mr Crompton said South Yorkshire Police was ""a very different place in 2012"" from what it was 23 years ago.
David Whiting, Chief Executive of Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: ""I sincerely apologise for the shortcomings identified in the report relating to the way in which the incident was managed in the early stages. ""
Sheffield City Council Chief Executive John Mothersole issued a statement in which he ""sincerely apologises"" for the actions of the council at the time.
Clive Betts, MP for Sheffield South-East, who was at the game, said he had been ""absolutely shocked"" by the scale of the revelations and called for a new inquest.
""To find out that 164 statements by police officers had been subsequently changed to alter what they said, to alter descriptions of the adequacy of the response to the disaster at the time, I think is really truly shocking and there are a lot of answers that still need to be found to questions raised by these findings,"" he said.
""I think it's very clear that the initial inquest cannot stand.""
The panel went on to say the wrongful allegations about the fans' behaviour later printed in some newspapers, particularly The Sun, originated from ""a Sheffield press agency, senior SYP officers, an SYP Police Federation spokesperson and a local MP"".
The panel said the Police Federation, ""supported informally by the SYP Chief Constable"", sought to develop and publicise a version of events derived in police officers' allegations of drunkenness, ticketless fans and violence.
""The vast majority of fans on the pitch assisted in rescuing and evaluating the injured and the dead,"" the panel said.
In a statement Sheffield Wednesday FC, whose ground hosted the fateful match, offered ""sincere condolences and an apology"" to all the families who suffered as a ""consequence of the tragic events""."
"The 19-year-old was taken off in the 15th minute at Vitality Stadium after appearing to pick up the foot injury.
City said in a statement: ""He will undergo further examinations in the coming days to establish the extent of his layoff.""
The Brazil international, who completed a £27m from Palmeiras in January, has played five times for City.
Jesus was hoping to become the third City player to find the net on each of his first three Premier League starts, having scored at West Ham and two against Swansea.
The other two players to have achieved that feat are former striker Emmanuel Adebayor and and current midfielder Kevin de Bruyne.
Metatarsals are the five long bones in the forefoot which connect the ankle bones to those of the toes.
The first is linked to the big toe and the fifth, on the outer foot, links to the little toe.
Together, the five metatarsals act as a unit to help share the load of the body, and they move position to cope with uneven ground.
Injuries usually occur as a result of a direct blow to the foot, a twisting injury or over-use.
Medical experts recommend rest with no exercise and sport for four to eight weeks.
The patient might be asked to wear walking boots or stiff-soled shoes to protect the injury while it heals.
If the cause is over-use, then treatment can vary hugely. Training habits, equipment used and athletic technique should all be investigated.
It all depends on the damage and which metatarsal bone is involved. It is impossible to put a timescale on recovery from a stress injury.
With an impact fracture, after the plaster and protective boot is not needed (usually after four to six weeks), it will be a case of exercise and increasing weight-bearing activities.
Ice packs, strapping and even the use of oxygen tents can be used to assist recovery.
Full return to action can be anything from another four weeks and upwards - depending on the extent of initial damage. Young bones heal quicker."
"Powell, 22, scored 12 goals in 41 appearances for Championship side Wigan during a loan spell in 2013-14.
He joined United for £3m from Crewe in 2012 and was loaned out to Leicester City and Hull City before his contract expired in June.
""He is the one player we wanted this summer and we are so happy we've got him,"" said Wigan boss Gary Caldwell."
"This is the first photograph revealing the face of murder-accused U.S. teenager Heather Mack's baby. Little Stella Schaefer is being cared for in prison by Mack, 19, who allegedly murdered her socialite mother Sheila Von Wiese-Mack in a plush Bali hotel last August before stuffing her body in a suitcase, together with her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21. While Stella was being looked after by a friend outside the court today, a blanket fell away, revealing the child's face to the world for the first time. Scroll down for video . Exclusive: This is the first photograph revealing the face of murder-accused teenager Heather Mack's baby . Motherhood: Little Stella Schaefer is being cared for in prison by Heather Mack, 19, who is accused of murder . U.S. teenager Heather Mack allegedly murdered her socialite mother Sheila Von Wiese-Mack in a plush Bali hotel last August before stuffing her body in a suitcase, together with her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21 . The little girl was kept outside Denpasar District Court while her parents appeared briefly, but separately, before a panel of three judges. Lawyers for both Americans said they rejected the premeditated charges that had been laid upon them. Last month a prosecutor demanded Mack, from Chicago, spend 15 years in a Bali prison, Indonesia, sparing her the death penalty, and Schaefer 18 years. As she waited in a holding cell to go into the court today, Mack sat on a bench with her baby in a carry cot - donated by a friend - beside her. 'Tomorrow, I'm having my stitches out,' she revealed in a reference to the birth of the baby by caesarian last month. 'It will also be time for Stella to have her injections - all the health injections that young babies have to have.' The battered body of Mack's 62-year-old mother was found 'folded up' in a suitcase that had been loaded into the boot of a waiting taxi at  St Regis Hotel in Bali's seaside Nusa Dua district last August. Schaefer has admitted hitting the victim with the metal handle of a fruit bowl in self-defence while Mack has been accused of helping him to force the body into a suitcase, which was then loaded into the boot of a taxi they had ordered. Father: Tommy Schaefer has admitted hitting Sheila Von Wiese-Mack with the metal handle of a fruit bowl in self-defence . Denied: Lawyers for both Mack (right) and Tommy said they rejected the premeditated charges that had been laid upon them . Tommy Schaefer's defence team, appearing at a separate hearing, rejected claims of premeditated murder . The couple did not board the taxi, however, instead leaving the hotel by a rear exit. They tried to leave Bali via the airport but they did not have their passports, which were being held in a safe deposit box at the hotel. Mack and Schaefer were arrested the following day at another Bali hotel. Mack said during an earlier court hearing that  they panicked after Schaefer’s attack with the metal bowl. She said they thought about either calling the police or taking the body in a suitcase to the U.S. Consulate. She did not explain why they did not do either one. In court today, Mack's lawyer, Ary Soendardi, said that all the prosecution claims were rejected by the defence team. He said at the time of Mrs Mack's death, her daughter was 'just pregnant' and for several reasons this had to be taken into consideration. Heather Mack is allowed to keep her baby with her in her cell  until the child is two years old. She said she plans to continue breast feeding during this time . Birth: The baby was born on March 17 and had to be treated in the jail clinic and then in hospital after developing a high fever and jaundice . Since being held in jail, Mack has been keeping her baby with her in a crowded cell in Bali's Kerobokan prison . Tommy Schaefer pictured here in prison with baby Stella, who was born by caesarian on March 17 this year . He also asked the court to note that her pregnancy had continued throughout the charging process and she was now a young mother with a tiny baby. Schaefer's defence team, appearing at a separate hearing, also rejected claims of premeditated murder, referring to earlier statements that the 21-year-old had struck out against Mrs Mack in self-defence because she had gripped him by the throat. The pair - and possibly the baby - will be back at the court again on Thursday next week when the defence teams are expected to present evidence supporting the couple's claim of innocence. Mack was previously told by the chief prosecutor Eddy Arta Wijaya she had 'committed sadistic acts to her own mother', but was spared the death penalty 'because she repeatedly expressed remorse and has a newborn baby'. Tommy Schaefer, 21, pictured in court today, is accused of murdering his girlfriend's socialite mother Sheila . Mack, pictured in court today, is allowed to keep her baby with her in her cell - which she is sharing with eight other women . Murder-accused Heather Mack, 19, from Chicago, listens to her interpreter at Denpasar District Court in Bali . Since being held in jail, she has been keeping her  baby, who has six fingers on one hand, with her in the crowded cell in Bali's Kerobokan prison. The baby was born on March 17 and had to be treated in the jail clinic and then in hospital after developing a high fever and jaundice. The child was later allowed to be taken back to the prison with her mother. Mack is allowed to keep her baby with her in her cell - which she is sharing with eight other women - until the child is two years old. Mack says she intended to continue breastfeeding for two years. She revealed there was another prison baby, aged seven months, in a separate cell. Jail sentences of less than 20 years for each of the defendants are far more lenient than the death penalty or lifetime in prison that many had expected to be handed down for the gruesome crime.

"Svetlana Kuznetsova will hope not, after she hacked some of her own hair off midway during a match at the WTA Finals in Singapore on Monday.
""I thought, 'what's more important? My hair, which can grow, or the match?'"" said the Russian world number nine, complaining that it was affecting her game in a three-set win over Agnieszka Radwanska.
Unfortunately, many a sports star has failed to embrace this philosophy of substance over style.
With the help of Sportsday readers, BBC Sport looks at some of the worst sporting hairstyles.
Former basketball star Dennis Rodman had a series of 'unconventional' styles - this was just one of them. He also adopted the bleached blonde look long before Aaron Ramsey, Messi and Neymar re-ignited the craze.
Rodman looks like he has just caught sight of himself on the big screen and is seriously questioning his life choices - as is the dude behind.
Giovanni Simeone, son of Diego, was seen sporting this quirky style when playing for Argentine side River Plate.
Yep, that's 'early noughties Joe Cole' when he tried to make it trendy to shave your initial into your head and dye it red.
Younger readers may be wondering if it caught on. It didn't.
Former Arsenal forward Gervinho revealed he had a hairline higher than his outrageous salary when he uncovered his forehead behind a pair of braided curtains.
It was the elastic headband that really caused a stir - it looked painful!
Striker Ronaldo decided this would be a good idea for the 2002 World Cup - Brazil went on to win it.
Yes, the pinnacle of your career and you have that haircut, shown on the front page of newspapers round the world.

"After Katie Zelem's first-minute opener for Liverpool, goals from Karen Carney, Fran Kirby, Drew Spence and Eniola Aluko put Chelsea 4-1 up at half-time.
Caroline Weir and Emma Lundh's second-half strikes gave the visitors hope.
But Kirby and Spence both added goals to restore the three-goal lead and keep pressure on leaders Manchester City.
Zelem, who netted twice in Liverpool's 3-2 loss at Notts County last time out, stunned the defending champions with a fine strike from range in the early stages.
But the floodgates opened after England winger Carney rounded the goalkeeper to level and the scoreline could have been bigger as Carney struck the crossbar with a free-kick late on.
Chelsea - who won 2-1 at Liverpool in their previous match - remain second, three points behind first-placed City, who have played a game more.
Emma Hayes' side face Arsenal in the Women's FA Cup Final at Wembley on Saturday, looking to defend the trophy they won for the first time last season.
Chelsea Ladies midfielder Drew Spence: ""It was a bit like a basketball match, the way the goals were going in for both sides. I was pleased with my two goals.
""But we're disappointed we didn't manage the game better after coming from behind to go 4-1 in front by half-time. We've got to learn how to not concede before we turn on the gas.
""That's something for us to work on in training this week in the build up to the FA Cup final.
""We beat Arsenal 2-0 in the league recently but we can't have any complacency because of that, it's going to be a tough game.""
Liverpool Ladies midfielder Caroline Weir: ""Scoring three goals is fine, but if you concede six you can't expect anything out of a game.
""We made too many defensive errors and that's just not good enough against a team as good as Chelsea.
""This is a tough place to come, but it was so disappointing for us after making a great start with a brilliant goal by Katie Zelem.
""We conceded some poor goals after taking the lead, and going in at half-time 4-1 down we knew that wasn't good enough."""
"A newly-released film about Manny Pacquiao offers a look into the Philippine boxer's childhood ahead of his much anticipated fight against Floyd Mayweather Jnr next month. 'Kid Kulafu', named after a brand of wine whose bottles Pacquiao collected as a child, charts his rise from humble beginnings to his first step into the boxing ring. 'He's just like every one of us,' director Paul Soriano said at the film's Manila premiere on Tuesday night. 'He was born with nothing but because of God, because of hard work and faith, he became something.' Scroll down to watch the trailer . Film director Paul Soriano (left) with actors Buboy Villar and Alessandra De Ross at the premiere of Kid Kulafu . Villar (right) plays the part of a young Pacquiao as he rises from humble beginnings to a boxing career . Soriano spent two years researching the film, much of it based on conversations with 36-year-old Pacquiao. 'Everyone can mimic his moves, but you can't easily copy his courage,' said Buboy Villar, who plays the young boxer. 'Pacquiao always faces people who are bigger than him and, as you can see, he's scrawny as a kid, so I think all the rough experiences he had growing up helped to make him strong.' The film opened in Philippine cinemas on Wednesday and will be shown in selected cinemas in the US and Canada later this month.

"Incredible footage has  captured the moment a huge stingray nibbles on a freediver’s head, gliding back and forth over the man’s body gently on the ocean floor. The video shows the incredibly peaceful encounter between the ray and Johnny Debnam, a 29-year-old commercial diver and ocean lover. Mr Debnam was free diving in water four metres deep; holding his breath and diving down to the depths of the ocean on Rottnest Island off the coast of Western Australia. Johnny Debnam says he felt completely at ease with the stingray, although he was aware of the risks . The commercial diver was free diving four metres beneath the ocean when he had his snuggle with the ray . ‘I was totally at peace. I loved that thing going over the top of me,’ Johnny Debnam said of the experience . The video shows the swimmer completely motionless in the seagrass, with the enormous 150 kilogram ray rubbing itself back and forward over his body - even nibbling at his head. ‘I blew all my air out and was totally calm and at his level,’ explained Mr Debnam during a mini documentary produced for his production company Terra Australis TV. Mr Debnam was completely enveloped underneath the stingray, but he remained calm and insists he relished every minute of the wonderful experience. The stingray is a potentially dangerous creature. If provoked it may use its spiky tail – known as a barb- to spear the victim and inject them with a deadly poison. Tragically, animal activist and Australian icon Steve Irwin was killed after a deadly encounter with a stingray. In September 2006 the creature stabbed him with its barb 'hundreds of times' as he filmed a documentary near Queensland's Great Barrier Reef. However Mr Debnam's relationship with the stingray was incredibly harmonious. He is experienced with marine life and in the video demonstrates his behaviour to be gentle and threatening, and the stingray appears to reward him with some appreciative cuddles! Johnny Debnam did not have any breathing equipment on when he let all his air out and calmly lay still on the ocean floor . The majestic stingray swum over him three times, enveloping him under his body as he glided on top . ‘Those things are huge. They’re massive and they could really mess you up if they wanted to,’ Debnam said during his Terris Australis TV documentary. ‘But, they won’t if they don’t want to.’ Responding to his calm nature, the curious stingray repeatedly glides over him, as if to try to determine what exactly it had found nestled amongst the reeds. Debnam is ecstatic after his snuggled with the majestic, friendly creature. ‘I was totally at peace. I loved that thing going over the top of me,’ he said. ‘It was awesome! It did it three times and I wanted it to do it again. ‘It was a bit of a rush really!’ Responding to his calm nature, the curious stingray repeatedly glides over him, as if to try to determine what exactly it had found nestled amongst the reeds . The production company he co-created, Terra Australis TV, specialises in creating stunning cinematography of the incredible creatures beneath the ocean’s surface in Western Australia. Debnam and his cameraman Cameron Wallace are passionate about showing the ocean respect whilst exploring and filming the wonders of the sea. ‘That’s what makes you feel alive. Natural, awesome, pure things like (swimming with a stingray),’ said Debnam. ‘You can’t buy it.’ See www.terraaustralis.tv .

"Countries around the world have launched massive aid operations to help victims of the Nepal earthquake, but distribution of aid faces challenges as Nepal is still trying to come to terms with the scale of the disaster. With over 4,400 dead, 8,000 injured and 8 million people across Nepal affected, numerous aid groups and at least 16 nations have rushed to send supplies and workers to the stricken country. But now the Nepalese government and army who are leading the disaster response face another problem: How to effectively coordinate and organize the massive influx of humanitarian aid. Here are three major obstacles that are hampering efforts of distribution. Nepal relies on only one international airport to receive and deliver aid. Relief organizations say the tarmac at Tribhuvan International Airport remains jam-packed with a large number of cargo planes. Several aircraft carrying essential supplies have been turned away, or diverted to India and elsewhere. ""The airport is totally congested. Even the planes which have landed, goods haven't been offloaded,"" Jagan Chapagain, the Asia Pacific Director of the IFRC (International Federations of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies) told CNN. Flightradar24, a live air traffic monitor, shows that incoming flights have had to circle in the air several times before being able to land. The United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team who is on the ground coordinating international relief efforts says they are doing all they can to address the problem. ""There are lots of flights arriving from around the world for search and rescue, and that's the challenge we're trying to address by supporting the airport staff directly,"" said Marcus Werne, a UNDAC team leader. But Chapagain says that airport management is still chaotic, with staff and military not being able to clear runways and offload supplies effectively. According to a U.N. situation report, main roads in Kathmandu are open, but remote areas are largely inaccessible. ""Due to the mountainous geography, infrastructure damage, collapsed bridges and damaged roads, access to many of the affected areas is reported to be extremely limited,"" read the report. The Nepalese government has not been able to provide relief to all affected areas due to difficulties in transporting goods, a government official told CNN. ""The helicopters are small. They don't fly in windy and cloudy conditions. Given Nepal's geographical terrain we cannot use surface transport much but we are using it,"" said Sagar Mani Parajuli, the Joint Secretary for Nepal's Home Ministry. The situation has deteriorated to the point where relief workers are as good as stranded. Pirtha Raj Joshi, a disaster management officer for Nepal Red Cross, had to walk 10 hours to reach a office in one of the severely affected districts, said Chapagain. Initial reports from the IFRC say that over 36,000 houses have been totally destroyed, with the number expected to rise as teams arriving in severely affected areas continue to assess damages. Just two days after the earthquake struck, Nepalese authorities leading the response are still trying to fully understand which areas have been affected, how they are affected and what the priorities are. ""Typically what we see, also in other emergencies, is that it takes a few days for supply lines, distribution lines to stabilize,"" UNDAC's Werne told CNN. ""Right now we're working with a lot of secondary data, and working on some of the key vulnerable areas identified prior to the earthquake,"" he added. The operation to get aid to survivors in Nepal is still ""very ad hoc"" and it will be a few days before the distribution becomes organized because the government is still constrained by the scale of the disaster, says Chapagain. CNN's Manesh Shrestha in Kathmandu, and Bex Wright and Jethro Mullen in Hong Kong, contributed to this report."
"Falkirk booked their place in the  Scottish Cup Final with a smash-and-grab 1-0 win over Hibernian at Hampden Park. The dominant Easter Road side hit the post just before the break through Fraser Fyvie and again in the second half through fellow midfielder Scott Allan, with the Bairns rarely threatening. However, the Hibees were stunned in the 74th minute when Falkirk midfielder Craig Sibbald headed in a Blair Alston cross to set up a meeting on May 30 with either Inverness or Celtic. Craig Sibbald finally breaks the deadlock for Falkirk with a stooping header that left Hibernian hearts broken . Sibbald rises above his marker to direct his header towards goal in the heat of Hampden Park . Sibbald salutes the travelling Falkirk supporters after scoring the decisive goal in the 74th minute . The Falkirk players celebrate taking the lead against Hibernian in the Scottish Cup semi-final at Hampden Park .

Booked: Forster, Allan . Falkirk (4-3-3):MacDonald; Duffie, McCracken, Grant, Leahy; Taiwo, Vaulks, Sibbald, Smith; (Bia Bi 45), Morgan (Muirhead 77), Alston . Subs not used: Bowman, Dick, Cooper, Blair, O'Hara . Scorer: Sibbald 74 . Booked: Taiwo . Referee: John Beaton . It was sweet revenge for the Bairns, who lost a seven-goal thriller to the Leith side at the same stage of the competition two years ago, and they will be looking to take the cup back to the town for the first time since 1957. For their part, Hibs, last winners of the trophy in 1902, will wonder if that curse will ever be broken after a semi-final in which they had bossed for long spells. Both managers were forced into changes for the all-Championship last-four tie. Hibs midfielder Scott Robertson replaced Martin Boyle who is cup-tied after playing for parent club Dundee in the competition before his loan move to Easter Road. Falkirk manager Peter Houston had John Baird and Mark Kerr cup-tied and top scorer Rory Loy failed to recover from an ankle injury as captain David McCracken returned to defence with forward Taylor Morgan given a start.

The Hibernian supporters can't quite believe their luck as Fraser Fyvie and Scott Allan both hit the woodwork . Lewis Stevenson misses from close range for Hibernian on one of those afternoon's for Alan Stubbs' side . There wasn't much too cheer about for Hibernian fans in a sparse Hampden Park crowd on Saturday . Falkirk went into the game undefeated in three league games against Hibs this season, drawing two and winning one, but found themselves under pressure from the first whistle. Indeed, Houston's side were lucky to escape going behind after only six minutes when Dylan McGeouch's fine cross from the right was directed toward his own goal by the foot of the stretching McCracken. Falkirk goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald chested it straight to the falling former Falkirk striker Farid El Alagui but, while flat on the ground, he headed straight into the arms of the grateful Bairns keeper. The Bairns hit back immediately. Midfielder Will Vaulks' long-range drive was deflected past the post as Hibs withstood a brief spell of pressure, with McCracken heading a Sibbald corner just past the near post. The tempo then subsided, as if both teams had surprised themselves with their early boldness. Hibs were the slicker but their final ball was lacking and so was their luck, it appeared. Two minutes from the break, after El Alagui had hit the side-netting, Fyvie's low drive from around 30 yards beat MacDonald. Luke Leahy celebrates Falkirk's win (left) as Hibernian's Scott Robertson looks dejected at the final whistle . However, the ball bounced off the post and back to the keeper who, like the Falkirk fans, again breathed a sigh of relief. Houston replaced David Smith with Botti Biabi for the start of the second half but, in the 47th minute, it was Alston who forced Hibs keeper Mark Oxley to push his 25-yard shot round the post for a corner, which came to nothing. The Easter Road men then dominated. In the 64th minute, as they pinned Falkirk back in their box again, McGeouch got his legs tangled trying to execute a volley before Lewis Stevenson skied his close-range shot high over the bar. Then Allan brilliantly weaved his way into the Falkirk penalty area before driving against the bar, with El Alagui heading his corner over moments later. But the Hibees were stunned when Falkirk took the lead. There was little imminent danger when Alston got past Robertson down the right, but he whipped in a delightful cross and Sibbald escaped the attention of McGeouch to power a header past Oxley. Reeling Hibs threw everything forward in search of a leveller. A Paul Hanlon tackle prevented Biabi getting his shot away on the counter - Falkirk cries for a penalty were dismissed by referee John Beaton - before MacDonald made a crucial save from El Alagui at his near post. Falkirk then held out for the three minutes of added time to spark scenes of joy among players and fans at the final whistle."

"Swansea manager Garry Monk is out to claim a season-first against Hull on Saturday - pick up some points after an international break. Monk's men have enjoyed an excellent campaign by being in the top 10 all season and are currently in eighth place with the club's best Barclays Premier League points total in sight. Swansea have eight more games to collect the five points needed to beat the 47-point mark posted in their inaugural Premier League campaign in 2011-12. Garry Monk is out to claim a season-first against Hull by picking up a point after an international break . The Swansea boss gestures towards his striker Bafetimbi Gomis during a training session this week . It is a campaign which has exceeded so many expectations but Swansea have yet to pick up a point after an international break this term, although in mitigation those have been away games at Chelsea, Stoke and Manchester City. 'International breaks are never easy because it does disrupt your preparations but we have to put that right on Saturday,' Monk said ahead of Hull's visit to the Liberty Stadium. 'A lot of the players come back later on in the week and you might get only two or three days preparation with some of them. 'But these are the decisions you have to make, you assess them when they come back and see where they are physically and mentally. 'You see how well they did in those games, make sure there's nothing from that and then select your side. 'But I don't read too much into those games we've had after the international break because we've been unlucky in some of them.' Wayne Routledge (right) marked by Kyle Naughton during the session as Swansea prepare for Hull . Swansea captain Ashley Williams (centre) in training as they look to end their post-international break duck . Swansea are seeking a double over relegation-troubled Hull after winning 1-0 at the KC Stadium just before Christmas. But Monk says games between the two clubs have always been tight affairs and he is not expecting anything different this time. 'I watched their last game against Chelsea and thought they performed extremely well and were unlucky to lose,' Monk said. 'We've always had close games with Hull. It's a tough physical game with them but they have got quality to hurt us if we're not on our game. 'This is it, the business end of the season and everyone's fighting for their own reasons. 'Hull are trying to stay away from danger at the bottom of the table, they will be very determined and we have to be prepared for that. 'But we're in good form at the moment and we're trying to push on and focus on our own agenda.'"
"On Friday his campaign backed away from his claim that he had been admitted to the prestigious US military academy at West Point. Mr Carson, however, continues to stand by his assertion that as a teenager he tried to stab a relative, angrily denouncing what he says is liberal bias in a CNN investigation that found no corroborating witnesses to the event.
In a presidential campaign season that has been anything but ordinary, the latest kerfuffle over Mr Carson's childhood stories places American politics firmly in bizarro-world.
""Ben Carson defends himself against allegations that he never attempted to murder a child,"" reads the headline on a New York magazine article.
Usually a candidate faced with previously unrevealed evidence of youthful indiscretions - or worse - denies the charges. Such was the case with Republican nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, when reporters unearthed evidence that he bullied other students in high school.
Here, however, Mr Carson is asserting that recollections from childhood acquaintances that he was bookish and shy are mistaken. Instead he's testified to the veracity of examples of misbehaviour that he cites as evidence of his childhood temper, including that:
Mr Carson recounts these stories during speeches and in his autobiography as evidence that he was a misguided youth who only achieved success after a religious awakening. It's part of the narrative that has earned the renowned neurosurgeon a devoted following among the evangelical community for years and is one of the reasons why he has attracted strong support from voters in Iowa, a key battleground in the Republican nomination race.
A CNN report found no evidence backing up any of Mr Carson's claims, however - even those that Mr Carson said took place on school grounds. Mr Carson appeared on CNN Friday morning to defend himself, leading to a heated confrontation when network presenter Alisyn Camerota pressed him for further details.
""This is a bunch of lies attempting to say I'm lying about my history,"" Mr Carson said. ""I think it's pathetic, and basically what the media does is they try to get you distracted.""
He said the names he cited in his book were changed to protect friends and family members and that the ""close relative"" he tried to stab had recently told him not to reveal his identity.
""The story is well-documented,"" Mr Carson said. ""If you choose not to believe it, if it doesn't fit the narrative that you want, that's fine. Let's let the American people decide.""
Mr Carson later told a conservative radio programme that he intends to fight CNN ""tooth and nail"".
That may turn out to be a more difficult battle for Mr Carson, however, after another claim in Mr Carson's book was found questionable. Shortly after the CNN confrontation, Politico reported that the Republican had erroneously asserted that he had been accepted to the US military academy at West Point.
Carson campaign manager Barry Bennett told Politico that the candidate was a decorated high school ROTC member who had been encouraged to attend the academy but had never formally applied.
As polls show Mr Carson solidifying his position among the leaders of the Republican nomination battles reporters have been stepping up their investigations into Mr Carson's past - unearthing an old speech where he made claims about the true story behind the Egyptian pyramids and scouring his writings for apparent inconsistencies or untruths.
It's a standard practice most politicians undergo, although Mr Carson's recent arrival onto the national stage means he hasn't been subjected to the kind of scrutiny more experienced candidates have weathered.
Whether any of this will adversely affect Mr Carson's standing in the Republican presidential race is an open question. The retired neurosurgeon has made condemnations of the media and ""PC culture"" a standard part of his campaign rhetoric, so he may already be immunised against perceived attacks from the mainstream press.
In last week's Republican debate on CNBC, a moderator who pressed Mr Carson to respond to allegations that he had close ties to a controversial nutrition supplement company was roundly booed by the partisan audience.
""They know,"" Mr Carson concluded.
And they very well may continue to stand by their man.
Candidates in (and out of) the Republican presidential field"
"German police are investigating whether a woman sickeningly claimed to be related to a victim of last month's Germanwings air disaster - so she could get free flights to southern France. The airline's parent company Lufthansa organised special flights for victims' families after the March 24 crash in the French Alps which killed all 150 people on board. The Halterner Zeitung newspaper - based in the town that lost 16 students and two teachers - said she flew to the region twice after falsely claiming to be one of the deceased teacher's cousins. Police are investigating the possible fraud and the alleged culprit will be questioned, a police spokesman in Hoexter has said. Scroll down for video . Fraud: Police in Germany are investigating whether a woman lied about being related to a victim of the doomed Germanwings flight (pictured) to get free flights to southern France . Cruel: As Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr (left) and Germanwings Managing Director Thomas Winkelmann (right) mourn, a German woman has been accused of using the disaster for her own gain . Liar: The woman allegedly tried to pass herself of as a deceased teacher on the flight, meanwhile passengers have laid flowers for the victims of the plane crash at the airport in Dusseldorf (pictured) Killer? Andreas Lubitz may have spiked his Captain's coffee so he would be left alone on the aircraft's flight deck, investigators have now said . Memorial: The first picture of the doomed crew of the Germanwings plane at Germanwings HQ in Cologne has been revealed . And Lufthansa says it is looking into what appears to be a 'regrettable isolated case' but did not give further details. The Airbus A320 went down in a remote region of the French Alps en route to Dusseldorf from Barcelona. Recordings from the flight data recorder suggest co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit before 'deliberately' crashing the jet. Crash investigators are now examining a computer belonging to Lubitz to determine whether he 'spiked' his captain's drink to force him into the toilet. The 27-year-old changed the aircraft's altitude to just 100 feet using the autopilot - sending it on collision course with the Alps. German prosecutors believe that Lubitz may have added a chemical to Captain Patrick Sodenheimer's coffee to remove him from the flight deck. Once Captain Sodenheimer closed the cockpit door, Lubitz enabled special security features preventing the reinforced door from reopening. The safety systems were introduced following the 9/11 attacks although the designers did not consider a rogue pilot seeking to kill himself while taking his passengers and fellow crew with him. Destruction: Lubitz remained silent during the final eight minutes of the flight as it crashed into the Alps . Probe: Investigators have been scouring Lubitz's computers to determine his state of mind before the tragedy . Already it has emerged that Lubitz used his computer to research methods of killing himself as well as information concerning the cockpit door locking mechanism. It is understood that European safety chiefs had concerns about Germanwings' safety procedures in the weeks before the crash. In November 2014, the European Commission contacted several airlines and 'had asked for clarification to make sure all airlines actively observe rules'. Following the crash, it emerged that Lubtiz suffered from crippling depression although Lufthansa, who own Germanwings, did not pass on this information to aviation regulators. Doomed: The Germanwings Airbus A320 crashed into a remote region of the French Alps en route to Dusseldorf from Barcelona . Investigators believe that Lubitz, 27, informed its flight school when he returned from a several-month break in pilot training in 2009 that he had experienced an episode of 'severe depression'. Lufthansa has said he subsequently passed all medical tests. The EU has detailed air safety regulations, which included rules on a pilot's mental health, that member states need to take into account. EASA regularly tests whether the 28 EU nations adhere to those standards. 'This is a normal and regular occurrence,' said the official."
"The 33-year-old made a total of 12 Test appearances and played a vital role in the 2010-11 Ashes victory in Australia.
""After 16 enjoyable years I feel that now is the right moment to call time on my playing career,"" the Surrey player wrote on Twitter.
""Unfortunately injury has hampered me throughout my career and now plays the leading role in my decision to retire.""
Tremlett has been affected by back and knee injuries in recent years and has been restricted to three Championship appearances for Surrey this season.
""My body, and back in particular, can no longer withstand the vigour of performing at the level required to play professional cricket,"" he said.
""After taking specialist advice this latest injury means that I will not be able to carry on.
""I have always tried to give 100% commitment and effort whenever I have played but no longer feel that this is possible.""
Southampton-born Tremlett, who began his career at Hampshire before moving to Surrey in 2010, took 53 wickets at an average of 27 in his 12 Test appearances for England.
The most significant, however, were the 17 in three matches as England won the Ashes in Australia in January 2011.
He also played 15 one-day internationals and one Twenty20 match for England, with his last appearance for the national team coming in the first Test against Australia in November 2013.
""Wearing the Three Lions was the pinnacle and I enjoyed every minute of the challenge, experience and ultimately the success that the team had,"" he added.
""I have been extremely fortunate to have enjoyed such a fantastic and memorable career and lucky enough to play with and against some of the best players in the world."""
"When Instagram users try to search for the aubergine, or eggplant, emoji hashtag no posts appear - even if there are posts tagged in this way . Last night Instagram rolled out its latest update that lets users create and search for hashtags using emoji. But it appears not all emoji hashtags are created equal. When people try to search for the aubergine, or eggplant, emoji using a hashtag on the app, no posts appear - even though there are posts that have been tagged with it. And it is believe to be because the emoji is commonly used to represent male genitalia and may be attached to images containing nudity. The anomaly was discovered by Katie Notopoulos from Buzzfeed. Emoji hashtags were released as part of Instagram's latest app update, which also added three new filters and a redesigned Love button. Hashtags can now be used with single emoji, multiple emoji or can be combined with text in post, comments, captions and when using the Explore tab. Instagram told MailOnline it is not commenting on the eggplant anomaly. But, given that the emoji could potentially be tagged onto images that contain nudity, it is likely the app is restricting its use under its community guidelines. It also appears the hashtag itself isn't banned across the app, instead it just can't be searched for. Instagram's guidelines explain: 'We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. 'This includes photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. 'It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK, too.' Ms Notopoulos has even created a hashtag called #freetheeggplant. Despite issuing an apparent ban on searching for the aubergine, searches for emojis such as the gun (left) and a syringe (right) are allowed. Instagram doesn't ban pictures of guns, although it doesn't allow the sale of guns. In terms of the needle, many images posted using this hashtag include tattoos and giving blood . Following yesterday's update, Instagram users can post, explore other people's photos and interact with captions using emoji. Emoji are popular in the Instagram community, with nearly half of Instagram captions (pictured on Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's page) already featuring the small pictures . But she also noted that despite issuing an apparent blanket ban on searching for the aubergine emoji, searches for emojis such as the gun and a needle and syringe are allowed. Instagram doesn't ban pictures of guns on the app, although it doesn't allow the sale of guns. In terms of the needle emoji, many images posted using this hashtag include tattoos and giving blood. However, if an image was to be posted of a person using drugs or guns in an illegal way Instagram would remove it. From sending countless 'poops' to adding hearts to sentimental messages, your choice of emoji says a lot about you. And experts recently analysed more than one billion uses of the tiny icons to see how they are used across different languages. Study found that the French are the most loved-up, sending more hearts than any other region, while Australians use double the average amount of alcohol-themed emoji. Swiftkey recently analysed more than one billion sets of emoji data, covering 800 emoji across 60 categories. The most popular categories for each language are pictured . In the US, gadget users send 30 per cent more LGBT-related emoji than the average, including a rainbow, men holding hands or women holding hands. This is followed by Canada and Malaysia. To plot the differences in use, London-based keyboard app firm SwiftKey analysed more than one billion sets of emoji data, covering 800 emoji across 60 categories. The findings of the report came from an analysis of data over a four-month period between October 2014 and January 2015, and includes both Android and iOS devices. The languages studied include English, including US, UK and Australian, Spanish, Vietnamese, French, Malaysian, Arabic, German, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Italian and Russian. Canadians are twice as raunchy as all other languages, according to the emoji study. They use twice as many so-called 'raunchy humour emoji', including the banana, eggplant, peach, cherries and Cancer astrological symbol than average. Vietnamese and French are half as raunchy as the average and US English speakers are the top users of the eggplant emoji at more than double the average. Italians use the banana emoji the most. Canadians are twice as raunchy as all other languages, according to the emoji study. They use twice as many so-called 'raunchy humour emoji', including the banana, eggplant, peach, cherries and Cancer astrological symbol than average (pictured) This would rely on either the image being reported by a fellow member or Instagram seeing the image itself. Subsequently, this suggests it will potentially allow images of illegal activity to appear in search, when tagged in this way, and act on it retrospectively but won't allow images of nudity to appear in the search results at all. Following the launch of the new feature, Instagram told MailOnline: 'Over the past few years, emoji have become part of a universal visual language. 'From today, on Instagram emoji will now work within hashtags, so you can add them to your posts, search for them on the Explore page, and tap on them in captions.' Emoji are popular in the Instagram community, with nearly half of Instagram captions already featuring the small pictures.

"A German former police officer who dismembered a willing victim he met on a website for cannibal fetishists was today sentenced to eight years and six months in prison. Detlef Guenzel chopped Polish-born Wojciech Stempniewicz into small pieces while listening to pop music before burying them in the garden of his home in Hartmannsdorf-Reichenau in 2013. 'He was found guilty of murder and disturbing the peace of the dead,' said presiding judge Birgit Wiegand at the regional court in the eastern city of Dresden. State attorneys had sought 10 and a half years in prison for the defendant, a trim, soft-spoken father of three whom neighbours described as friendly, generous and unfailingly polite. Lawyers representing the family of Stempniewicz, 59, had requested a 15-year sentence, usually the maximum in a murder case. But prosecutors said they stopped short of this demand because Stempniewicz said he wanted to die. Macabre: Former German police officer Detlev Guenzel smirks in court before being sentenced to eight years and six months in jail for killing a willing victim he met on a website for cannibalism fetishists . Deranged: Guenzel, 57, went on trial in August over the killing of Polish-born business consultant Wojciech Stempniewicz whose body he had cut into small pieces and buried them in his garden . The defendant sat impassively with arms folded as the verdict was read out. The men came across each other in October 2013 on a website for slaughter and cannibalism fantasies billed as the '#1 site for exotic meat' and boasting more than 3,000 registered members. The two kept in contact via email, text message and telephone before finally arranging the fatal date for November 4 that year. Gunezel picked Stempniewicz up at Dresden's main railway station and drove him back to his house in Hartmannsdorf-Reichenau which he ran as a bed and breakfast with his male partner. Prosecutors said Gunezel then took his victim to the basement where he strangled him using a rope tied to a pulley before chopping the corpse up into small pieces. A video reportedly shows Guenzel in his underwear slicing the naked body of his victim into pieces while it hangs from a hook. The back garden of Guenzel's home in Hartmannsdorf-Reichenau where the body parts were buried in 2013 . Described as 'absolutely horrific' and 'beyond belief' by lawyers, the 50-minute tape features Guenzel dismembering the corpse while pop music plays. At one point he stops to listen for a heartbeat before continuing. However the defence team argue that the video shows Stempniewicz had his feet in constant contact with the ground, meaning he could have stopped the strangulation if he had wanted to. They claimed the video, which was shown to judges behind closed doors, proves the victim hanged himself. Gunezel then spent a total of four hours cutting the body up with a knife and saw, before burying it in shallow holes the garden. Policemen search for evidences in the area where body parts were found in Reichenau near Dresden in 2013 . Officers traced him via computer messages and telephone calls and he was arrested at the police HQ where he worked as a handwriting specialist. When police arrived at the property he showed them where the pieces were buried, but officers say the victim's penis has never been found. The case mirrors that of Armin Meiwes, a man found guilty of killing, dismembering and eating computer technician Bernd Brandes at his remote farmhouse home near Kassel. Meiwes, now serving life imprisonment, packaged the flesh of his 16-stone victim into neat parcels which he froze and ate portions of over a ten month period. When police finally arrived to arrest him there was less than 40lbs of Brandes remaining."
"Police are considering manslaughter charges after a man who was violently shaken as a baby died as a result - two decades later. Liam Dawe, 21, was born a healthy child but suffered serious and on-going health complications ever since he was assaulted as a four week old. He died at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon in March last year from 'intra-abdominal sepsis' after developing cerebral palsy following the the assault. Liam Dawe died at Derriford Hospital (pictured) in Plymouth, Devon, in March last year from 'intra-abdominal sepsis' after developing cerebral palsy following the the assault . At an inquest into his death in Plymouth, coroner Ian Arrow said: 'On the balance of probability, Mr Dawe's health was compromised (by the assault) and he died earlier than expected.' A senior officer attended the hearing and said the law changed in 1996 that meant an act was presumed not to have caused a person's death if it happened more than a year before. But Det Con Insp David Elliott said as Mr Dawe's injuries were caused in 1993 before the rules came into force, fresh manslaughter charges could still be brought. The inquest heard that Liam, of Tavistock, Devon, was born an otherwise 'normal, healthy baby with no concerns' in 1993, but was shaken at just four weeks old. Police are considering manslaughter charges after Liam Dawe died two decades after being assaulted as a four week old . As a result of an injury to the brain, Mr Dawe developed severe cerebral palsy, epilepsy and visual impairment as well as learning, feeding and respiratory difficulties. He was admitted to Derriford Hospital on March 4 of last year with jaundice and later died on March 25 after his condition deteriorated following a laparotomy to treat an intra-abdominal sepsis. His GP Dr Jo Coldron said: 'There was no health concern at birth, but at four-weeks-old, Liam suffered from a non-accidental injury that led to learning difficulties, cerebral palsy muscle spasms, scoliosis, epilepsy, an unprotected airway and respiratory difficulties. 'On March 4, Liam was admitted to Derriford Hospital. He was slightly jaundiced but otherwise seemed well. 'He was later admitted to ICU, but there was no clear source for his abdominal sepsis. The 'year and a day rule' stated that an act was presumed not to have caused a person to die if more than a year and a day had elapsed before death. The ancient rule, which applied to death and suicide, was abolished under the Law Reform Act 1996 amid medical advances. However, the permission of the Attorney General is still required for any prosecution where it is claimed that the death occurred more than three years after the act, or when the offender has previously been convicted of an offence in connection with the death. 'On March 12, he was discharged by ICU onto the ward where his condition deteriorated before he died on March 25.' DCI Elliott attended the inquest to assess the assault Mr Dawe sustained as a baby to determine its significance in his death. He said: 'The question asked of us was if somebody would be prosecuted for manslaughter. 'The adult who assaulted Liam when he was four weeks old was convicted and sent to prison for 12 months imprisonment. 'Liam was shaken at four weeks old and his injuries resulted in ongoing health problems. 'The assault was a deliberate act and, at the time, the question was whether the adult intended to cause grievous bodily harm. 'In June 1996, there was a law change to the ""Year and a Day"" rule which stated an act was presumed not to have caused a person's death if more than a year and a day had elapsed before death. 'However, as the injuries were sustained in January 1993, the rule still stands.' Coroner Ian Arrow concluded the cause of Liam's death was 'intra-abdominal sepsis in an individual with severe cerebral palsy.'"
"Vincent Hudson has been charged with the historical offence on a boy under the age of 16, Cumbria Police said.

"A Russian warship and two bombers strayed close to UK territory yesterday in yet another apparent attempt to test Britain’s defences. A destroyer equipped with missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes entered the English Channel along with two other Russian ships. It forced the UK to send a heavily-armed frigate to monitor the vessels. A map showing the how jets were launched from RAF Lossiemouth yesterday, shortly after HMS Argyll was deployed to monitor a Russian destroyer and two other ships as they passed through the English Channel . Just a few hours later, two Russian long-range Bear bombers, capable of carrying nuclear missiles, hugged British airspace – prompting the RAF to deploy two Typhoon fighter jets. Sources claim both incidents may have been an attempt to ‘snoop’ on a huge Nato war games exercise taking place in Scotland. Even though Russian military inspectors were invited to attend the show of strength, the timing raised suspicions that Vladimir Putin was using access to the site to test UK reaction times. It later emerged that the Russians had actually been at the Typhoons’ base at RAF Lossiemouth when the warplanes were scrambled. No explanation: Experts said Russian President Vladimir Putin's move to send planes capable of carrying cruise missiles so close to British shores could be seen as an act of aggression .

Under watch: The Royal Navy monitored a Russian Udaloy class destroyer (not pictured) along with a tanker and a support ship as they passed through the English Channel .

If armed the ship's commander could have targeted the aircraft in self defence . June 2014 - HMS Montrose was sent to monitor a Russian corvette in international waters near Denmark's Baltic coast. The frigate was then circle by a Russian maritime patrol craft . October 2014 - RAF Typhoons intercepted a Russian Bear aircraft over the North Sea and Russian warships pass through the Channel escorted by the Navy . October 30, 2014 - 26 Russian bombers, tankers and fighter jets on military exercises are intercepted around Europe in just 24 hours. Jets are scrambled by the RAF and allies in Germany, Portugal and Turkey after the 'unusual' spike in activity, which saw two giant Tu-95 Bear H bombers fly close to Britain . November 2014 - HMS Argyll monitors a heavily armed Russian warship as it strayed close to the UK while passing through the English Channel and Strait of Dover . January 2015 - Typhoons were dispatched from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland and RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire to intercept two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles as they flew south of Bournemouth . February 17, 2015 - HMS Argyll intercepts a Neustrashimy-class warship and its accompanying tanker as they headed home after a deployment in the Mediterranean in the English Channel . February 19, 2015 - Two RAF Typhoon jets scrambled from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire to escort two Russian bombers in international airspace off the coast of Cornwall. April 2015 - Royal Navy's HMS Argyll monitors Russian Udaloy class destroyer Severomorsk along with a tanker and a support ship as they move through the English Channel. The incursions are the latest in a long line of apparent tests by Moscow as tensions between Britain and Russia rise. The Nato naval operation – Exercise Joint Warrior – was aimed at encouraging Mr Putin to calm his recent aggression toward the UK. But Sir Michael Graydon, former head of the RAF, said the Kremlin was using Cold War tactics to ‘snoop’ on the exercise and called for higher defence spending to defeat a ‘resurgent’ Russia. He said: ‘This is a classic return to the 70s and 80s when every exercise conducted by Nato was snooped on. ‘We’ve trumpeted the fact we are holding such a large exercise and the fact they are snooping on it doesn’t surprise me at all.’ He added that Britain should spend more on defence: ‘Our capability to deal with these sorts of threats is diminishing because we don’t have the manpower... we need resilience.’ A source added: ‘It may be that they are observing the military exercise being held off the coast of Scotland.’ Under a European treaty, the Ministry of Defence were forced to accept an inspection by Russian experts and they arrived in Scotland on Monday. Yesterday the destroyer Severomorsk, a tanker and a support ship returning from the Mediterranean were intercepted by the Royal Navy as they passed through the Channel. Plymouth-based HMS Argyll, a Type 23 frigate with a crew of 185, was sent to monitor the vessels. A source said the Russians may ‘poke their noses in at the exercise off Scotland’ before heading home. An RAF spokesman said the two Bear bombers, which flew off the north-east coast of Scotland hours later, were escorted away. More than 100 Russian aircraft were intercepted last year, three times more than during the whole of 2013. In November a four-strong Russian flotilla sailed through the Channel and earlier this year two Bears flew south of Bournemouth.

"Two warring sisters were yesterday stripped of the right to control their aged mother’s fortune because of the intensity of the hatred between them. The hostility between the women – one a 61-year-old retired GP and the other a 58-year-old radiographer – meant they would never be able to make rational decisions about how to deal with the 97-year-old widow’s property, a judge said. Senior Judge Denzil Lush said the elder sister could be jailed for attempting to alter a legal document, so she could gain greater control over her mother’s money. The mother, who has dementia, lives in a care home in Stoke Mandeville, Buckinghamshire. She owns a £600,000 house, has savings and shares worth £100,000, and has an income of £1,200 a month. The Court of Protection case was brought by the Office of the Public Guardian (pictured) - the regulator of agreements for people without capacity . The judge said both sisters were unsuitable to control her affairs ‘because of the intense acrimony between them’. Instead he appointed a court deputy to carry out this role. The ruling was made in the secretive Court of Protection in which hearings are routinely closed to the public. The judge ordered that none of the family be named. Senior Judge Lush said the ‘daughters don’t see eye to eye. In fact, they detest each other.’ According to the GP, the judge said, ‘the two of them have been in the same room together on five occasions during the last five years, and on each occasion her sister has refused point blank either to speak to her or even acknowledge her presence. The only communication between them is by email, and this is usually rancorous in tone.’ The disastrous relationship between the two sisters and their failure to handle their mother’s affairs as she slipped into dementia were revealed in a ruling by the secretive Court of Protection. The sisters agreed with their mother in 2007 that they should draw up an agreement to control her money and property if she became unable to do so herself. The mother, a widow since 1984, owns a house in Marlow worth between £550,000 and £600,000, savings and shares worth about £100,000, and has an income of around £1,200 a month. Since suffering from dementia she has lived in a care home in Stoke Mandeville that costs £940 a week. However, the sisters have rowed over their mother’s care. The dispute has involved the younger sister, the radiographer, objecting to her elder sibling’s choice of care home - which is a two-hour journey away from her own house. It has also involved an accusation from the GP that her younger sibling only visits their mother once a week or once a fortnight. The document drawn up by the sisters in 2007 to control their mother’s affairs - an Enduring Power of Attorney - was put into effect in 2013. Since suffering from dementia the mother has lived in a care home in Stoke Mandeville (pictured) costing £940 a week . But Senior Judge Lush said that at some stage the elder sister had attempted to alter the document. She attempted to change the attorneys’ appointment from ‘joint’ to ‘joint and several’. It meant that the doctor could take decisions on her own about the money, without reference to her sister. The judge added that when she registered the new document the GP ‘knew that this statement was false.’ The Court of Protection case was brought by the Office of the Public Guardian - the regulator of agreements for people without capacity. The OPG told the court that there were no witnesses to the alteration of the document. Judge Lush said there were criminal penalties for dishonestly tampering with an Enduring Power of Attorney . Laura Knight of the OPG told the court that ‘it is more difficult to believe that a professional person with the responsibilities of the GP would misunderstand the difference in appointment types’. Miss Knight added that the GP said that her late aunt had agreed that the document should be changed, but ‘while this seems plausible, it is alarming to see an attempt by reasonably educated people at amending an important legal document without any witnessing being attempted or legal advice being taken.’ Judge Lush said there were criminal penalties for dishonestly tampering with an Enduring Power of Attorney. He said the punishments could run up to two years in jail but any charges were a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service. He added that he thought prosecution would not be in the interests of the mother, who would be caused ‘significant distress’. The judge said of the doctor: ‘Notwithstanding the natural love and affection between them and the undoubted support she has provided to her mother in recent years, I find her unsuitable to be the donor’s attorney.’"
"Luis Suarez says he nutmegged Paris Saint-Germain defender David Luiz twice because it was his quickest way to goal. The Barcelona forward scored a brace in his side's 3-1 win over PSG in the Champions League quarter final to put the Spanish side firmly in control in the tie. And Suarez said: 'A striker is always looking for goals and the two moves came off for me. Luis Suarez puts the ball through David Luiz's legs before scoring his second goal for Barcelona . 'I had to nutmeg Luiz twice because there was nothing else I could do.' The double on Wednesday night took his tally to 17 goals for Barca this season and 11 in his last 11 games . Neymar put Barca ahead before Suarez struck his first goal of the night, threading the ball between Luiz's legs at pace, holding off a challenge from Maxwell and firing home. Suarez scored twice as Barca put themselves in control of the tie with a 3-1 first leg win . Suarez says his the tie is not over despite the two goal lead . His second of the night was even better, again nutmegging Luiz before striding on and planting a shot into the top corner. But the forward was not looking ahead to the semi-finals just yet, adding: 'In football you never know what's going to happen. 'They have so much quality and we need to be aware that this isn't over. It'll be a good game.'"
"The General Court of the European Union said there were ""internal inconsistencies"" in the Commission's 2010 decision.
Of the firms, Air France was fined the largest amount - €182.9m - while KLM was fined €127.2m.
The two carriers merged to form Air France-KLM in 2004.
Other carriers involved were Air Canada, Martinair, British Airways, Cargolux, Cathay Pacific Airways, Japan Airlines, LAN Chile, Qantas, SAS and Singapore Airlines.
Lufthansa escaped a sanction after providing information to the Commission.
The court said that the European Commission had not been clear enough in demonstrating an unambiguous ""single and continuous infringement"" by the carriers.
Instead, the Commission had found four infringements which it had attributed directly to the carriers on particular routes, the court said.
""Internal inconsistencies"" in the decision could infringe the airline's rights of defence, the court added.
Some of the carriers had said that the decision ""did not allow them to determine the nature and scope of the infringement or infringements that they were alleged to have committed""."
"Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the US would consider working with Russia in some areas but would stand up for its own interests.
Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary James Mattis said Washington was not ready to collaborate militarily with Moscow.
US President Donald Trump has called for improved ties with Moscow.
But the new administration's diplomatic initiative comes as questions are raised about the Trump team's dealings with Russia dating back to last year's election campaign.
US intelligence services have concluded that Moscow hacked into emails of President Donald Trump's Democratic opponents during the election.
Rex Tillerson may be on a steep learning curve in the transition from oil executive to top diplomat. But the State Department press corps is also adjusting. We'd become accustomed to the garrulous John Kerry, now we have his opposite: The Quiet Man.
So far Mr Tillerson has spared only a few words for us, a ""Good Morning, y'all"" as we boarded the plane in Washington. And he diligently refused to respond to questions shouted out during brief moments of press access at the beginning of his meetings in Bonn, Germany.
So we gleaned what we could: he chatted about his flight with the Saudi foreign minister and about jetlag with the Turkish foreign minister. Boris Johnson, the British Foreign Secretary, made him laugh with a joke about the Commonwealth.
""Good try,"" Mr Johnson muttered as we lobbed another question, prompting more laughter but no answer. We were heartened when Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made opening remarks, and perplexed when we were ushered out just as Mr Tillerson began to respond.
He did give us a 43-second statement on Russia afterwards. And eventually a few spontaneous words as the questions continued. All in a hard day's work
And three of Mr Trump's aides have been forced out over allegations about their links with Russia, including National Security Adviser Mike Flynn earlier this week.
Mr Tillerson met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of a G20 meeting in Germany as part of his first foreign trip in his new job.
He said the US was willing to co-operate with Russia if Moscow lived up to its commitments.
""As I made clear at my Senate confirmation hearing, the United States will consider working with Russia when we can find areas of practical co-operation that will benefit the American people,"" he said.
""Where we do not see eye to eye, the United States will stand up for the interests and values of America and her allies.
The secretary of state added that he expected Russia to honour its commitment to the Minsk agreements aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine, and to work to stabilise the region.
Russia's role in backing separatists in the east of the country has soured relations with the West since the conflict began in 2014.
Mr Lavrov said the two sides had agreed to co-operate in areas where their interests coincided, particularly in the fight against terrorism, over Syria and in other countries in the Middle East where ""terrorism has put down roots"".
However, he said that they did not discuss US sanctions against Russia, first imposed when Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine nearly three years ago.
Mr Tillerson, who as ExxonMobil CEO was perceived to be close to the Russian leadership, told his nomination hearing in the Senate that he would consider reviewing the sanctions.
Mr Tillerson also met the UK's Boris Johnson and other foreign ministers from the G20, made up of developed economies and emerging nations including China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa and Brazil.
At a Nato meeting in Brussels, Gen Mattis rejected calls by Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu to ""restore co-operation with the Pentagon"".
""We are not in a position right now to collaborate on a military level, but our political leaders will engage and try to find common ground or a way forward,"" he told reporters.
The defence secretary said that Russia had to abide by international law, adding that there was ""little doubt"" that Moscow had interfered or attempted to interfere in several Western elections."

Discussing how different women's bodies react during pregnancy, Dr Venkat, Director at Harley Street Fertility Clinic, said: 'If a woman is healthy - physically and mentally - to start with and if she looks after herself well then she will look radiant. 'The hormones are elevated during pregnancy and women react differently to the hormones. Some women are particularly sensitive to elevated hormones and suffer with symptoms, whereas others sail through without any symptoms.' Dr Venkat added that a woman's height plays a role and the taller a woman is can help her carry herself with better posture than a shorter woman. When it comes to working out, she says, women generally don't need to worry about staying in shape during pregnancy. Citing walking and gentle stretching as the best exercises during pregnancy, she says women are going to be exhausted in the first couple of weeks after delivery and can start exercising after a fortnight, once a routine is established.

"Fo, whose plays include Accidental Death of an Anarchist and Can't Pay? Won't Pay!, won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1997.
He was also known for Mistero Buffo, a one-man play he travelled the world with for 30 years.
His plays often starred his actress wife Franca Rame.
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, a target himself of Fo's sharp wit, remembered him on Thursday as ""one of the great protagonists of theatre, culture and the civic life of our country"".
He said: ""His satire, his research, his work on set design, his multi-faceted artistic activity remain the legacy of a great Italian in the world.""
Born in March 1926 in Sangiano, a small town on Lake Maggiore, Fo learned the art of storytelling from his grandfather, a travelling salesman with a gift for spinning yarns.
He was conscripted towards the end of World War II but managed to escape, spending the last months of the war hidden in an attic.
Moving to Milan, Fo studied architecture before turning to writing and performing.
After meeting Rame in the early 1950s, he achieved success with a series of monologues that led to his own show on Italian national radio.
After establishing the Fo-Rame theatre company in 1957, Fo and his wife earned national recognition with a series of hit stage farces.
But their work, often critical of the political establishment, led to battles with the censors and attempts at suppression.
Dario Fo thought the long Italian tradition of commedia dell'arte - broad, even slapstick humour - could be used to comment on modern society.
His work was filled with energy and political protest. He drew on the history of Italian theatre but became one of the most performed modern playwrights anywhere.
His early material was gentle enough, but Fo later became a sharp-eyed satirist of the Italian state and corruption. For years he was banned from Italian TV for his irreverence.
His radical politics meant he was twice prevented from entering the USA. Writers, among them Arthur Miller, protested at his exclusion.
When Fo was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1997, the citation said he ""emulated the jesters of the Middle Ages in scourging authority and upholding the dignity of the downtrodden"".
On stage, Dario Fo made serious political points by being comic.
Accidental Death of an Anarchist, Fo's best-known play, was written in response to the real-life death of a political anarchist while in police custody.
First performed in 1970, it went on to be staged in more than 40 countries.
Fo, who was admitted to hospital earlier this month, had been due to give a talk in Edinburgh last weekend.
Playwright David Greig paid tribute, saying Scottish theatre ""owed a tremendous debt"" to ""an extraordinary theatre maker"".

"A Germanwings passenger has revealed how a pilot on a recent flight calmed fliers' nerves before takeoff by leaving the cockpit to give a speech so they could all look him in the eye. Hugh Roche Kelly, who was flying from Berlin to Paris yesterday morning, posted the account on his Twitter profile of how the pilot managed to dispel the 'tense vibe' by his actions. Data from the second black box recorder on Germanwings Flight 4U9525 today confirmed co-pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately flew the Airbus A320 into the side of a mountain into the French Alps, killing 150 people. Scroll down for video . A Germanwings Airbus A320 much like the one which crashed in the French Alps, killing 150 people. A passenger on one of the company's flights from Berlin to Paris has praised the pilot for calming nerves . Hugh Roche Kelly posted on his Twitter account how impressed he was with the pilot's pre-flight speech . Andreas Lubitz, the Germanwings co-pilot who deliberately brought down Flight 4U9525 last week . Nerves were calmed on Mr Kelly's flight as he took the time to say a few words in three different languages, saying he was thankful passengers were still prepared to fly with the company. Mr Kelly's post said: 'There was a tense vibe - the crew were on edge and some passengers were definitely more nervous than normal. 'Once I was actually onboard, and looked at the crew door, it was all too easy to imagine how horrific the time before that crash would have been. 'I was thinking about what kind of a response a company should make to something like this. Do you ask everyone to carry on as normal, with utmost professionalism and a stiff upper lip? 'Then, our pilot came out and made almost his normal pre flight speech, except he did so standing in the front row. 'He spoke about how it was a difficult and strange time for him and for all the cabin crew, how they still all love doing their job, and how they're thankful that they still have passengers coming onto their planes. 'Mostly though, he said he just wanted to come out and stand in front of everyone and let all the passengers on his flight have a moment of eye contact with him, and for us to meet him and for him to meet us.' Mr Kelly's post said: 'There was a tense vibe - the crew were on edge and some passengers were definitely more nervous than normal' Lubitz was responsible for the worst air disaster in Europe in recent history, as both black box flight recorders have no confirmed . French gendarmes get ready to visit the crash site of the German Airbus A320 as part of the search operation in Seyne-les-Alpes . The first black box voice recorder from the Germanwings flight that was recovered last week revealed Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed the plane. The second has now confirmed he intended to crash it . Relatives of the victims of the Germanwings Flight 4U9525 crash on Tuesday put down flowers at the memorial in Le Vernet, south-eastern France . Mr Kelly added that the pilot's efforts had made him feel 'enormous respect for him', adding 'anyone listening could tell it was a difficult thing to do - to stand in front of 150 more-nervous-than-they-really-needed-to-be people and say ""everything's going to be fine, because I am going to look after it"". 'So, well done that man.' The aviator's impressive efforts came just days after it emerged how fellow Germanwings pilot Frank Woiton hugged each individual passenger as they boarded a plane preparing to retrace the route taken by ill-fated Flight 4U9525 just two days after it crashed. Woiton, 48, told German newspaper Bild how he received a huge round of applause after he delivered an emotional speech before takeoff on the flight between Barcelona and Dusselforf. Wreckage: Rescue workers and investigators pictured at the crash site of the Germanwings Airbus A320 in the Alps . French emergency rescue services work at the crash site of the Germanwings plane where 150 people died . French emergency rescue services are pictured here sifting through the wreckage of the crashed plane . The pilot, who once flew with killer airman Lubitz, told passengers: 'You can rely on the fact that I want to sit this evening with my family at the dinner table.' French air accident investigators said today the 27-year-old used the automatic pilot to put the plane into a descent and repeatedly adjusted the controls to speed up the aircraft. The revelation adds further weight to evidence from the cockpit voice recorder that Lubitz acted deliberately when he crashed the Airbus A320 into the French Alps at 430mph. A judicial source working alongside Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said the information confirmed their worst fears. The second black box, which was found charred and crumpled at the crash site yesterday, measures data such as speed, altitude and pilot action and was an 'indispensable element' in the investigation, said the source. The BEA air accident agency said in a statement that investigators have so far only obtained initial readings from the device and were continuing to extract data.

"Supermarket giant Asda has been forced to recall dummies which could pose a choking risk to newborns for the second time in two years. The chain was alerted to a possible fault in the packs of Little Angels 2 Newborn Soothers 0+ Months after a customer complaint on Facebook. The complainant said that the teat had detached from the hard casing of one of the dummies, although luckily the baby was unharmed. The Asda Little Angels 2 Newborns 0+ dummies, which have been recalled by the supermarket over a potential choking risk . Customers are now been asked to either dispose of the products or return them to an Asda store, where they will be given a full refund. The supermarket said that no other Asda Little Angels dummies had been affected and that the recall was a 'precaution'. It comes after parents were also asked to return packs of the Little Angels Cherry Soother in January 2013, when a fault was identified. Again a choking risk emerged when one dummy came apart in a baby's mouth. An Asda spokesman said: 'These are two isolated incidents involving different products. 'We are yet to conduct our investigation to identify the cause of the problem, but we take any complaints about baby products extremely seriously, which is why we have taken the decision to recall the soothers as a precaution.' The recall is the second that Asda has issued in two years after the Little Angels Cherry Soother dummy was recalled after one came apart in a baby's mouth (file picture) Meanwhile in a notice to customers, the supermarket apologised for any inconvenience caused by the recall of the dummies, which are sold in twin packs. Asda said: 'We have had one customer complaint that the teat has broken away and detached from the hard casing, so we have taken the precaution of taking the product off sale and recalling from customers due to the possible choking risk. 'The care and safety of our customers is out top priority, which is why we are recalling the product even though there has been only one complaint and we are yet to conduct our investigation.' In 2007, the supermarket was also forced to recall 115,000 Chinese-made bottles due to fears the caps could break off. Although no child was hurt drinking from the bottles, which were intended for children aged three and over, the supermarket asked customers to return them for a full refund."
"Chinese property conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group have formalised their purchase of 20 per cent of Spanish champions Atletico Madrid. The purchase was formalised at an Extraordinary General Meeting on Tuesday where the legal team representing Wanda Madrid Investment signed off on the purchase of 726,707 shares for €45million (£32.8m). The deal was initially announced in January but two EGMs were needed in order to ratify the deal. Wanda Group chairman Wang Jianlin hopes to grow Atletico's brand in Asia . Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone speaks to the media . Wang Jianlin, Chairman of Wanda Group, said: ‘Wanda Group is delighted with the possibility of contributing to the growth of Atletico Madrid and the development of its brand in Asia, as well as being able to rely on their extraordinary experience in the training area, which no doubt will be very useful in the growth of base football in China.’ Meanwhile, Miguel Angel Gil Marin, CEO, added: ‘It's a very important step for the club in their effort to build a global leading brand, which will help us maintain the sporting competitiveness of the past years and consolidate among the first clubs of football in the world.’"
"The oldest human footprints left behind on a muddy lakeside 1.5 million years ago appear to have been made by prehistoric hunting parties. Researchers examining the site where a series of tracks left by a barefooted early human in Ileret, northwest Kenya, have now found a total of 99 prints. They now believe that they belong to groups who all passed over the soft mud at the same time - perhaps even stalking some of the other animals whose prints are also preserved in the mud. The distinct tracks found at Ileret in Kenya (like the one above) are the oldest human footprints in the world . It provides some of the strongest evidence yet that the human ancestors that left the prints - Homo erectus - were sophisticated hunters. While their ancestors before them may have eaten meat they scavenged or from small prey they were able to catch, hunting parties suggests Homo erectus went after larger prey. Early human ancestors may have evolved to throw spears allowing them to hunt around two million years ago, a new study has suggested. Research by Dr Neil Roach has shown that the that the skeletons of Homo erectus had shoulders and collar bones that would have allowed them to hurl sticks accurately and powerfully. This would have enabled Homo erectus to become a proficient hunter, able to throw weapons like spears and rocks at potential prey. Dr Neil Roach, a palaeoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York who led the study, said the prints appeared to have been made by adult males. He said that the tracks represent groups hunting for antelope or wildebeest. Speaking to Nature, Dr Roach said: 'What we can say is that we have a number of individuals, probably males, that are moving across a lake shore in a way that is consistent with how carnivores move. The researchers, who presented their findings at the annual meeting of the Paleoanthropology Society in San Francisco, hope to test their conclusions by studying the movement patterns of modern day subsistence hunters in Africa. The tracks in Ileret were first revealed in 2009 after researchers at Bournemouth University and Rutgers’ Koobi Fora Field School in Kenya, announced they had discovered a collection of 22 human prints. This deep print appears to have been left by a male Homo erectus that may have been part of a hunting party . Analysis of the print tracks (above) showed they had been made by a early human that walked much like we do . The prints were preserved in sediment that had once been the shoreline of an ancient lake. Alongside the human prints were those of birds including storks, pelicans as well as crocodiles, antelope, hippos, bovids and other predators. Professor Matthew Bennett, who was part of the team that originally studied the footprints, is shown above crouching in front of the ancient human tracks . Analysis of the footprints by Professor Matthew Bennett at Bournemouth University revealed the human prints had been made by a species with a similar bipedal stance and gait to modern humans, with a pronounced arch and short toes. He concluded that the prints had probably been left by Homo erectus - an extinct species of early human that disappeared around 200,000 years ago. They were among the longest surviving of all the human species - surviving for around 1.5 million years. There is some evidence that they may have also been able to control fire and cooked food. Footprints this old are extremely rare as they tend to erode away in a few thousand years, but are also valuable as they can give clues about behaviour. Dr Roach and his colleagues decided to study the prints in more detail in order to get a snapshot of the life led by Homo erectus. Over a four year excavation period a total of 483 prints in the Ileret sediment have now been uncovered - 99 of which were human. Unlike the grass-eating antelope and other hooved tracks preserved in the stone - whose tracks led from grasslands to the shore - the human prints all walked in one direction along the shoreline. This matched the behaviour of other hunting animals whose prints were also preserved. Previous work by Dr Roach has also shown that Homo erectus had developed the physic needed to be a deadly hunter. Homo erectus, shown in the reconstruction above, may have hunted large prey in groups or hunting parties . Fossilised skeletons how their shoulders and collar bones would have allowed them to throw sticks or spears both accurately and powerfully. Dr Roach said: 'There’s starting to be a consensus that around 2 million years ago we see more carnivory that has to do with hunting.' Curtis Marean, a palaeoanthropologist at Arizona State University in Tempe, said it was hard to tell from the prints exactly what had made them. He told Nature: 'It could be a group hunt, but it could also be lake shore foraging.' Tucking into meat for dinner helped early humans spread more quickly across the world and had a profound effect on human evolution, scientists say. The high-quality diet allowed mothers to wean babies earlier and have more children, meaning that human communities grew faster, according to researchers from Lund University in Sweden. The research compared 67 species of mammals, including humans, apes, mice and killer whales, and found a clear correlation between eating meat and earlier weaning. They found young of all species stop suckling when their brains have developed to a particular stage, but that carnivores reached this point more quickly than herbivores or omnivores. Eating meat enabled the breast-feeding periods and thereby the time between births to be shortened, according tot he researchers. Among natural fertility societies, the average duration of breast-feeding is 2 years and 4 months. This is not much in relation to the maximum lifespan of our species, around 120 years. It is even less if compared to our closest relatives: female chimpanzees suckle their young for 4 to 5 years, whereas the maximum lifespan for chimpanzees is only 60 years."
"A transgender comedian is the latest real life model to star in a campaign for clothing label ModCloth, in which she models a variety of her favorite feminine styles. Rye Silverman, 32, a Los Angeles-based writer and self-confessed 'gender rebel', has been a fan of ModCloth's designs for years, and often posts pictures of herself wearing the clothing on the company's Style Gallery, an open fashion forum where customers can showcase how they have styled each item to suit their own personal tastes. It was through these images that Rye caught the eye of the label's executives, who were quick to contact her about starring as one of ModCloth's monthly Fashion Truth campaign stars, a group of individuals who help the brand to get across the message that fashion is for everyone, no matter what their size, shape or gender. Fashion star: Comedian Rye Silverman (pictured) is the newest star of ModCloth's Fashion Truth campaign . Dressed to impress: The 32-year-old Los Angeles resident has long-been a fan of the brand's clothing collection, and frequently posts images of herself on the ModCloth open fashion forum . 'Five years ago today, I came out of the closet,' Rye explained on the ModCloth website. 'Today, these are the clothes that came out of my closet. 'I try to have new adventures or do things that scare me. That’s what my cross-country moves [from Ohio to New York to LA] were about, and in a big way, my coming out as transgender. 'I’d started getting real open and honest onstage in my act, and one day I realized I couldn’t really be honest if I was living a lie. So I guess that’s what the most important thing is to me, living an honest, real life and not holding back. 'I waited years for someone to come along and tell me that it was okay to be myself before I finally realized that someone was me. That’s what fashion is all about for me - taking how you feel and using your style as an expression of that.' While speaking to the brand about the campaign, Rye explained how society's attitude toward her has changed since she made the decision to come out as a transgender, noting that many people feel that they are entitled to question her motives for doing so. Breaking out: Rye, who came out as a transgender when she was 27, says that 'living an honest life' is the most important thing to her . Personal style: One of Rye's favorite items from the ModCloth range is the Mewseum Visit Dress (L), but she admits she enjoys experimenting with her style . 'I think the downright most rude thing is when people flat out just ask me about my plans for transitioning, usually some variation on if I intend to have surgery or not, which is an extremely personal question if you break it down. It’s basically “So what’s up with your junk?”' she explained. 'It’s also an issue because it puts an emphasis on specific treatments as being indicative of if someone is or isn’t ""really"" trans. That can be a really dangerous attitude to run into for someone who’s just coming to terms with themselves or on the cusp of coming out.' When it comes to her sense of style, Rye admits that she loves experimenting with different ensembles and trends. '[My sense of style] evolves over time but I think right now my best way of describing it is a bit of a quirky or edgy twist on vintage,' she explained.  'I love rockabilly-type stuff or circle skirts that have interesting prints on them. 'The two garments I currently get the most positive responses to are my Mewseum Visit Dress from ModCloth and my PacMan-themed circle skirt. I’ve noticed in the last year or so more and more of my skirts and dresses have fun prints. But when I’m kind of just looking for a more relaxed, chill look I shift into a more 90s vibe.' Polka dot: Rye was chosen to feature in the campaign by ModCloth's co-creator Susan Koger . Call for change: ModCloth's Fashion Truth campaign hopes to prove that fashion is accessible to everyone, no matter their shape, size, gender or style . In honor of her starring role in the campaign, and her ongoing love of fashion, ModCloth has actually named a dress from its range after Rye, the aptly-named All About Rye Dress. ModCloth's Fashion Truth campaign was first launched back in September, pledging at the time that the company would endeavor to feature diverse, real life models, and offer a variety of clothing sizes and styles. Earlier this year, the brand used a group of its own employees as models for its most recent swimwear campaign, with the aim of proving that its styles were fit for real people of all shapes and sizes. 'The real hope around this is that we are putting the idea in everyone's heads that every size and shape and body, every single person - every woman - is just beautiful,' ModCloth employee-turned-model Christen DiClaudio said of the campaign at the time. 'And as long as she is trying to be the best version of herself, which we say a lot here at ModCloth, that's perfect. We hope that this is eventually the regular mindset in our society: that the best version of yourself is the best version there is.'"
"England's Joe Root has every hope the team can kick on and win the second Test against West Indies, after his first overseas century headlined a positive day for the visitors. Root's unbeaten 118 came with England posting a 74-run lead at the end of day three, while the score of 373 for six was also down to some impressive batting from England's top order. Captain Alastair Cook got 76 in a century stand with Jonathan Trott (59) at the top before Gary Ballance's 77 boosted his 165-run partnership with Root, making it a very happy St George's Day in St George's, Grenada. Joe Root celebrates his century and is 118 not out at stumps on day three of the second Test in Grenada . England's Root smashes a short ball to the boundary as West Indies keeper Denesh Ramdin can only watch on . Root plays confidently off the back foot through the offside during a commanding innings . Root and Gary Ballance run between wickets as they easily work the West Indian bowling around on a hot day . The end of the day was slightly marred by the loss of three quick wickets, with Ballance, Moeen Ali and Ben Stokes departing deep into the final session, leaving Jos Buttler (four) to start day four alongside Root. When asked about England's chances of victory, Root told Sky Sports: 'Absolutely. We've got plenty of batting left in that dressing room. 'Build a partnership with Jos tomorrow morning and hopefully we get a big score and only have to bat once. England captain Alastair Cook hits through the offside as he enjoys some width on day three . Jonathan Trott cuts before the ball can reach Windies captain Ramdin's gloves on his way to 59 runs . Cook congratulates Trott on his first Test half-century since returning to the England line-up in the morning . '(We) had a blip towards the end there but there is still plenty of batting left in that dressing room and fingers crossed we can kick on and make a big first innings score.' Root's personal effort was also his sixth Test century - his first came on home territory at Headingley in 2013 against New Zealand, a side he could well be facing later this year. The Yorkshireman added: 'I'm just trying to score as many runs as I can each time. The more I can make over a hundred, the better. 'I feel good. My movements are very good at the minute. You go through blips (in your career) and the key now for me is to score as many as I can while I have this going for me.' Ben Stokes is given a salute send-off by his West Indian rival Marlon Samuels after holing out for eight runs . Trott answered some of the criticisms levelled at him after he struggled on his Test comeback in Antigua, but was still after more. 'Alastair and I were really pleased to put on a good start but I'm sure both of us are disappointed we couldn't go on and make a bigger score,' he said. 'You don't spend all those hours in the nets to get fifties, you go there to get match defining hundreds. 'But we get on pretty well, we've got a goods understanding in the middle and it was nice to get back in the groove.'"
"It will take a while for supporters and other leaders of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party, or AIADMK, to come to terms with the huge void created by the death of Jayalalitha, one of India's most flamboyant and controversial leaders.
The party, founded in 1972 by the charismatic MG Ramachandran, known as MGR, a film star turned politician, has been playing a crucial role in providing political stability in Tamil Nadu, which is among the most important Indian states economically and politically.
Jayalalitha's death has triggered an air of uncertainty among the 75 million Tamils who have been used to seeing the AIADMK either as a governing party or as the main opposition for nearly four decades.
Political stability has played a key role in Tamil Nadu's development over the years.  Its economy has been growing at a rate of around 12% in the past 10 years, much higher than the national average of around 8%.
Tamil Nadu is also the second largest economy among Indian states, next only to Maharashtra. Its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2015 was estimated to be around $150bn (Â£119bn). And as a whole, GDP per person in Tamil Nadu is 68% higher than the national average of $1,390 (Â£1,102) a year.
For the moment, one of Jayalalitha's trusted lieutenants, O Panneerselvam, has taken over as chief minister. The smooth transition of power has surprised everyone. But there are challenges ahead.
""The party does not have any other leader who is similarly charismatic or popular. That is a vacuum. Right from its inception, the AIADMK has had popular leadership. For the first time, the party does not have a popular figure,"" says Gnani, a veteran political analyst.
It is well known that there is no second - or even third - line of leadership in the party. The AIADMK flourished and succeeded mainly because of the charisma of Jayalalitha after she took over the party in 1990. At the helm, she never allowed anyone to challenge her and those who showed signs of rebellion were summarily dismissed.
As a woman leader in a male-dominated society, she stamped her authority to instil respect or even fear among her party's men. Her autocratic style led to her ministers and senior party members prostrating in front of her in public, sometimes even in front of her car, to get her blessing or attention.
The AIADMK leadership - both MGR and Jayalalitha - appealed directly to its supporters, mostly in rural and semi-urban areas. The middle-level leaders were usually hand-picked and most of them had no political base of their own.
The winning formula was achieved by offering free tablets, bicycles, televisions and money, and also by striking alliance with smaller or caste-based political parties. The party's election symbol, Two Leaves, introduced by MGR, is still a powerful tool to attract votes.
There is speculation that Jayalalitha's long-time friend and confidante Sasikala Natarajan is likely to play a crucial role in the party's affairs and establish a power structure around her.
Though she was close to the former leader, Mrs Natarajan was never given any official position by Jayalalitha. Mrs Natarajan and her family members are influential within the party, but they do not have any political base of their own.
If there is any trouble within the party over the growing influence of Mrs Natarajan, that will work to the advantage of the main opposition in Tamil Nadu, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). It is not uncommon in Tamil Nadu politics to engineer a split in the rival camp to bring down the government.
Some regional leaders of the AIADMK, who were sidelined by Jayalalitha, may use the opportunity to stage a comeback and demand ministerial berths.
Any infighting within the AIADMK is also likely to have an impact at the national level politics. In the past two decades, India's political direction has been dictated by powerful regional parties and the AIADMK was one of them.
It took 30 years for a single party to achieve an outright majority in the Indian parliament, in 2014. Support of the regional parties was crucial in the formation of a national coalition government.
But the political equation changed after Narendra Modi led the BJP to power two years ago.
Whether in a coalition or not, an assertive Jayalalitha never hesitated for a moment to take on the central government, even eclipsing her mentor MGR. She castigated the federal government over their stance on the Sri Lankan Tamil issue or the Cauvery river water sharing dispute with neighbouring Karnataka state.
There are concerns now that a weak AIADMK beset by internal squabbles will reduce the party's influence in central policies affecting the state.
""Regional parties have already lost their influence after the BJP got an absolute majority in parliament. If infighting erupts within the AIADMK, it will diminish the power and political leverage of the AIADMK. But the BJP still needs their support in the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) to pass crucial bills and laws,"" says AR Venkatachalapathy, historian and professor at the Madras Institute of Development Studies.
If nothing goes wrong, the present AIADMK government is expected to complete its full term and the next state assembly elections are scheduled for 2021.  The challenge for the AIADMK will be how it will face the electorate if there is any election in the interim period.
The two Dravidian parties - AIADMK and DMK - have been ruling the state for nearly five decades. The national parties, like Congress and the BJP, have been waiting for decades to make inroads in Tamil Nadu. Is it the right moment?
""It AIADMK weakens, then the main opposition DMK will benefit. I don't think any national party (like Congress or the BJP) will benefit from the situation. The DMK will move into the space,"" says N Ram, former editor-in-chief of the Hindu newspaper.
Tamil Nadu has witnessed lots of political drama over the years, but it is now entering a new phase and getting used to a life without Ms Jayalalitha for the first time in 35 years. More twists and turns are on the cards."
"There were 69 claims against peacekeepers in 2015, up from 52 in 2014 was 66 in 2013.
Almost a third of the 2015 claims were made in the Central African Republic.
For the first time, the report has also set out all the countries whose soldiers are reportedly involved under a new ""name-and-shame"" policy.
Overall, 10 peacekeeping missions were subject to allegations in 2015.
The allegations involve military personnel, international police, other staff and volunteers.
According to the UN's latest figures, there are 124,746 personnel serving in 16 peacekeeping missions worldwide.
It has been criticised for failing to act quickly on sexual abuse allegations made against peacekeepers.
Last December an independent panel calling the UN response to allegations in the Central African Republic (CAR) ""seriously flawed"" and a ""gross institutional failure"".
It accused senior UN officials of abusing their authority by failing to take action over allegations of abuse by soldiers from France, Equatorial Guinea and Chad.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon's report called for an international convention on ""crimes committed in peacekeeping operations"".
He also urged countries to change their laws so that they apply to sex crimes committed by citizens serving in UN peace operations.
Mr Ban also called for ""on-site court martial proceedings"" for some crimes and a DNA database of all peacekeepers.
UN peacekeepers operate under the legal jurisdiction of their home countries, making prosecution more difficult.
In February, the UN said it would send home more than 100 peacekeepers from CAR following sexual abuse allegations.
A 10,000-strong UN force took over a peacekeeping mission in the country in September 2014.
After CAR, the second highest number of allegations was at the UN peacekeeping mission in Congo, with 16 cases, followed by Haiti with nine."
"The group that did it has revealed scripts from upcoming movies as well as the salaries of some of the biggest stars and personal emails between employees.
Some details are harmless, others have triggered FBI investigations and put jobs at risk.
A group calling itself Guardians of Peace claimed responsibility although their reasons and demands remain unclear.
Sony's new film The Interview, a comedy that features a plot to assassinate North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, is the reason for all this chaos.
North Korea denied being involved in the hack attack but has described it as a ""righteous deed"" that may have been carried out by its ""supporters and sympathisers"".
Sony Pictures has contacted some US news outlets in an attempt to limit the damage.
They've asked various media sites not to publish what has been leaked by the group.
So let's look at what we've found out so far:
The Interview was meant to be Sony's big Christmas release but is now at the centre of a terror threat.
The hackers, calling themselves Guardians Of Peace, says US cinemas which show the film can expect a ""bitter fate"".
But America's department for homeland security said there ""was no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theatres.""
As a result, the New York premiere of the film was cancelled and James Franco and Seth Rogen stopped doing publicity for the movie.
Sony Pictures has now cancelled the planned release of the film. It says the majority of cinemas had decided not to show the comedy.
So what do we know so far?
George Clooney's personal emails revealed he was personally stung by the critical reaction to his film The Monuments Men.
It's claimed he was completely mortified by the poor take-up of the movie, which he co-wrote.
In an email to the co-chairman of Sony's Motion Pictures Amy Pascal, Clooney spoke about not being able to sleep over the reviews of the film.
It's also claimed he asked for ""protection from all the reviews"" after its initial release.
Women sometimes get paid less than men at Sony.
Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams didn't get the same fee as their male co-stars in American Hustle, according to another leak.
The Daily Beast went through thousands of emails, but to summarise, the male stars received 9% of back-end compensation, which is essentially an amount based on the success of the movie in the box office, not an upfront fee.
J-Law, apparently, picked up just 7%.
Emails reveal Sony executives made joking references to black-themed films that President Barack Obama might like.
The exchanges, reported by Buzzfeed, were between Amy Pascal (yes, remember her name - we'll be mentioning her again) and top producer Scott Rudin.
""What should I ask the president at this stupid Jeffrey breakfast?"" Ms Pascal said to Mr Rudin.
It's then reported that she speculated about whether President Obama might like Django Unchained, a movie about a former slave.
Mr Rudin suggested 12 Years a Slave might be preferred.
They have both since apologised.
Comments about Barack Obama weren't the only ones flying between this duo, according to the leaks.
Mr Rudin reportedly labelled Angelina Jolie a ""minimally talented spoilt brat"".
It's claimed the comment was in reference to the actress being upset about director David Fincher working on the film Jobs, about the life of Apple founder Steve Jobs, when Jolie wanted Fincher to direct her in Cleopatra.
Jolie later came face-to-face with chairman Pascal at a party where photographers pictured  them sharing an uncomfortable stare.
It's fairly well-known that Leonardo DiCaprio was originally supposed to play Steve Jobs but later passed on the upcoming Aaron Sorkin movie, but what isn't common knowledge is Ms Pascal and a film producer's apparent reaction to the news.
""Horrible behaviour,"" producer Mark Gordon wrote. ""Actually despicable,"" Pascal corrected him in emails leaked by the Daily Beast.
Sony declined to comment on this story.
It's thought Sony executives also made fun of Willow and Jaden Smith - that's despite his success for Sony with the Karate Kid remake and dad Will's long-standing relationship with the studio.
An email from Tom Rothman, head of TriStar productions, to, yes you guessed it, Pascal, saw the exec forwarding a link to the Smith kids' out-there interview with The New York Times, along with the note: ""1. Read this. 2. they r home schooled: don't let this family date your movies!!!""
An early version of the script for the new James Bond film has been stolen by hackers.
Spectre's producers confirmed the screenplay was taken as part of an attack on Sony Pictures in November.
In a statement on the film's official website, Eon Productions said they were concerned the script may at some point be published online.
Spectre is due to be released in November 2015.
It's Channing Tatum to Amy Pascal's rescue.
Another email for her, but fear not, it is everything Tatum and caps lock fans could want.

"Jamie Carragher says Mike Ashley has turned Newcastle United into a ‘boring’ club and has accused the billionaire owner of only being interested in making money. His words are sure to resonate with supporters who boycotted Sunday’s 3-1 defeat at home to Spurs – a sixth straight loss which equals their worst-ever run in the Premier League. Before the game fans gathered outside the Gallowgate End and were united in choruses of ‘We’re rich but our team is s***’ and ‘Where’s the money gone?’ in protest at Ashley’s running of the club, which this month returned record profits of £18.7million and later revealed they have £34m sat in the bank. Mike Ashley has been accused of making Newcastle a 'boring' club because he only wants to make money . Carragher, too, is alarmed at what has become of Newcastle. ‘I can understand why fans are frustrated,’ said the Sportsmail columnist in his punditry role on Sky Sports. ‘It’s getting to the stage now, football is so big and there’s that much money coming in to the game with the new TV deal, I am sick of owners coming in who are successful business people wherever they’ve been. They think “Where else can I make money? Oh a football club”. ‘I’ve had it at my own club Liverpool with George Gillett and Tom Hicks and it’s the same at Newcastle. Jamie Carragher slammed the chairman and says he's alarmed at the state Newcastle are currently in . ‘People will say as supporters you’ve got to come back, you’ve got to get behind your team. But what are the owners doing for supporters? ‘Since Mike Ashley’s been here they’ve been relegated once and they could be relegated once again. ‘So he’s balanced the books - he’s made money because he’s a businessman - but I think of these people and wonder, “Don’t you want to be excited yourself?”. ‘I’m getting bored by Newcastle. When you watched them over the years there was madness, there was excitement, stupid goals going in one end and then the other, but it was exciting. ‘Now it’s boring. Why does Mike Ashley want the club if there’s nothing happening? There’s no cup run, I just don’t get it. I don’t get why he wants to own a football club.’ Meanwhile, former Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn says Ashley must try to reconnect with the club’s fans. Thousands of fans chose to boycott the Tottenham game in protest of Mike Ashley's tenure at the club . Some fans that did go to St. James' Park showed their disgust in the stadium with banners and posters . There was blocks of empty seats where fans chose not to attend the 3-1 loss to the London side . ‘I think you’ve got to get the balance right. It’s not just about making money,’ he said. ‘Early on in his tenure here he was getting criticism and he made his mind up he was doing it his way and he didn’t care what the fans thought. And that is something that just doesn’t work. ‘Sunderland fans will resent me for saying this, but the Geordie fans have been through everything with this football club, and for them to stay away and not watch a game of football at this club - that hurts. It tells of the disconnect and it has to be resolved. ‘To reconnect has to be the best way forward.’ Thousands of posters were created by Ashleyout.com and passed around the city prior to the game ."
"""Hope made a poor decision that has resulted in a negative impact on US Soccer and her team-mates,"" head coach Jill Ellis said.
Solo, 33, will now miss matches on 8 February against France and 13 February against England.
This month, domestic violence charges against Solo were dropped.
In 2012, Solo, tested positive for a banned substance a month before winning a second Olympic gold medal.
She maintained she was not aware the pre-menstrual medication she had been prescribed contained a banned substance and she was cleared of any wrongdoing.
The US are preparing for the Women's World Cup in Canada in June when they will aim to win their third title following victories in 1991 and 1999.
The latest incident surrounding Solo concerns a training camp being held by the team in Carson, California.
Solo's husband, former Seattle Seahawks NFL player Jerramy Stevens, was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in Los Angeles in the early hours of Monday morning.
Media reports claimed Solo was in the car but she was not cited in the incident by Manhattan Beach police officials.
Solo tweeted: ""I think it's best for me to take a break, decompress from the stress of the last several months and come back mentally and physically ready to positively contribute to the team."""
"The plant will create 150 jobs on the Ebbw Vale enterprise zone, which is still hoping to be home to the Â£325m Circuit of Wales.
New owners, who bought the British brand three years ago, will start production next year.
The company has a 10-year plan, including four new models, and will begin making a few hundred cars a year.
TVR had been looking at three sites around the UK.
Mr Jones said: ""This is yet another fantastic high profile investment for Wales and a great boost for our automotive sector.
""TVR is another iconic and much loved, world-class brand that still commands a strong and loyal international following. I am delighted the next generation of TVRs will proudly bear the label Made in Wales.""
There have been 350 advance orders for the car already, after images of what it might look like were released late last year.
TVR chairman Les Edgar  said: ""This is a fantastic opportunity both for TVR and the Welsh Government.
""South Wales is becoming a major hub for automotive and motor sport technology and development and I am delighted TVR is investing here.""
The company hopes to be producing around 2,000 cars a year by 2022, targeting the UK and selected European markets initially.
It will initially assemble the car in Ebbw Vale - bringing in the V8 engines from Cosworth in Northampton.
Former F1 designer Gordon Murray is behind iStream carbon technology to give the new models extra strength.
THE HISTORY OF THE TVR
Analysis by Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent
The automotive industry in Wales already includes 40 component manufacturers and more than 100 other firms in the supply chain.
Ford and Toyota have engine plants and Aston Martin recently announced plans to assemble a new model in the Vale of Glamorgan.
The Welsh Automotive Forum estimates 18,000 people work in the sector in Wales, with sales worth Â£3.2bn a year.
But the impact of the sector is greater than just the number of people working in it. On the whole it's an industry that pays well. On top of that it has to be innovative.
It is continually having to improve design and models to make vehicles cleaner and more efficient. Component makers also have to keep looking at the way they themselves work so they keep winning contracts to supply the car makers.
As a result, it is an industry that tends to be high on training and big on investment in its people and machines.
That means it is of more benefit to the Welsh economy than the same number of workers in other industries.
TVR will bring much needed jobs to the Heads of the Valleys and a simplified assembly process, so its factory only needs to be 20% of the size of a conventional plant.
It estimates this could reduce capital investment in the assembly plant by around 80%.
The first minister would not be drawn on how the Welsh Government had supported the deal.
But he said the news, hot on the heels of the Aston Martin announcement ""sends out a strong, clear message that Wales is the location of choice for advanced manufacturing"".
Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said it showed the Welsh automotive industry was ""surging from strength to strength.""
He added: ""Today's news is yet another strong endorsement of the quality of Britain's car industry, which has been creating jobs, taking on apprentices and contributing to building a stronger economy.""
Although an impression of the new car was released last year, the design of the first new vehicle is still under wraps with plans to unveil it towards the end of 2016, with production starting next year.
Circuit of Wales chief executive Martin Whitaker welcomed the news as ""fantastic"" for the region.
""Paired with Aston Martin's recent announcement, it reinforces our vision of Ebbw Vale and the south Wales region growing into a cluster of excellence for automotive and related industries,"" he added."
"Firefighters were called to a blaze in Kilmaurs Road at 23:40 on Saturday.
The woman, local resident Catherine Kelly, was pronounced dead at the scene. A 41-year-old man was taken to hospital with serious injuries. Another woman, aged 41, who was also in the house at the time was not injured.
Police said the fire was a ""targeted and deliberate act"".
Officers have appealed for witnesses to come forward. They indicated they are following a definite line of inquiry.
Local residents who tried to help put out the blaze were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation.
The injured man was taken to Crosshouse Hospital where medical staff described his condition as stable.
Det Ch Insp Allan Burton said: ""The outbreak of fire within the house on Kilmaurs Road has resulted in the death of an elderly woman.
""Following a joint investigation with our colleagues at the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, we now know that this was a targeted and deliberate act.
""Local residents are understandably shocked and I would like to acknowledge the bravery of those neighbours and passing motorists who raised the alarm and attempted to do what they could to extinguish the blaze.
""I want to reassure local residents that all is being done to trace the person or persons responsible.""
Specialist forensic staff and detectives remain at the scene as part of the murder investigation.  Additional uniformed officers are also on patrol in the area.
Det Ch Insp Burton added: ""We have spoken with a number of witnesses at this time.
""I would ask any local residents or passing motorists who have yet to come forward and speak to police, please contact us with any information you may have."""

"Sports car icons Porsche have put their newest vehicle to the test in a mesmerising world-first stunt in the Australia Outback. The video depicts the 918 Spyder clocking 350km/h as it rockets down a dead-straight stretch of road on the on the Stuart Highway, north of Alice Springs, on a stretch of road with  no speed limit. The car was driven by New Zealand professional race car driver Craig Baird, who switches the vehicle into ‘Race Hybrid’ and slams his foot on the throttle when they reach the unrestricted zone. Scroll down for video . The video is part of a promotional tour from Porsche to promote their 918 Spyder, a limited edition $900,000 supercar . The $900,000 vehicle is driven by a petrol-electric hybrid system which can accelerate from 60km/h to its 350km/h top speed in a mere 40 seconds. In ‘Race Hybrid‘ mode the motors work in unison with the 4.6-litre V8 petrol to deliver  a staggering  8,500 rpm of power. Obviously, this stunt is not to be tried by the amateur driver: Porsche used radios and spotters to ensure that the road was completely empty at the time, and Baird is a highly-experienced racer with multiple V8 Supercars and Porsche Carrera Cup race wins to his name. In 2012, Craig Baird was honoured with a special Porsche bonnet, recognising him as the most successful Carrera Cup driver in the world.

"Michael Vaughan, who is favourite to become England’s cricket supremo, was quick to condemn the openers after West Indies got them both out early on. With Jonathan Trott out without scoring in the first over and captain Alastair Cook failing again Vaughan said: ‘Their footwork and their mindset has been about looking to survive rather than getting on top.’ Geoff Boycott was also critical of the pair, saying: ‘Opening batsmen are supposed to face the new ball when it’s doing a little bit. If you can’t play that, you’re in the wrong job.’ Michael Vaughan criticised the footwork and mindset of England's top order for just looking to survive . Jonathan Trott was out for a duck on his return to the Test match side in Antigua . Alastair Cook was clean bowled by Kemar Roach for 11 as England struggled on the first morning . Former fast bowler Bob Willis said: ‘England’s top three looked constipated and need a good dose of syrup of figs.’ West Indies’ early success after putting England into bat appeared at that stage to make a mockery of the comment by Colin Graves, the new England and Wales Cricket Board chairman, who labelled the opposition ‘mediocre’."
"Memphis Depay appears to be edging closer to a move away from the Philips Stadion as PSV Eindhoven director Marcel Brands has revealed there is a high chance his side's star player will leave in the summer. The Manchester United target, who scored an emphatic 19 goals in 25 league games so far this season, has been tipped to join one of Europe's big boys after impressing in the Eredivisie. Depay's former international manager Louis van Gaal is said to be in the race to sign the 21-year-old and Brands has openly admitted that his side are resigned to losing the Dutch international. Manchester United target Memphis Depay looks set to leave PSV during the summer transfer window . Dutch international Depay has scored 19 goals in 25 league games so far this season . Brands, speaking to ANP, said: 'The chances are very high that he leaves. If you see what clubs are enquiring about him, they really are the best in Europe. 'When I talk for PSV I would say he is not ready and should continue here for another year. But I am realistic and if I worked at a big European club, I’d buy him without question. 'With a heavy heart [we would let him go], because a great player and a great guy leaves. But we are also proud that a boy from the academy is going to make such a step.' Tottenham, Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain are also among the contenders to sign Depay.

"We came on a commercial flight to Kathmandu. Blue tarps were visible from the sky for people to hide under -- signs that there was something wrong. We had to circle the airport for a couple of hours. There were a couple of issues. There was an aftershock this afternoon, so they were checking the runway for damage. Military and aid flights have priority, and a few military planes -- Indian military planes -- were going in, trying to bring in aid. Whether they did is unclear. When we landed at the airport, it was wet and cold. A couple of thousand people were lining the road to the entrance to the airport trying to get out. But there's no way to get out, really. There were torrential rainstorms for a couple of hours, and with the strong aftershock a couple of hours ago, no one wants to go inside. The residents of Kathmandu sure don't. You can see some structural damage to buildings. Most buildings are not up to high construction standards. Fallen: Nepal's historic landmarks . Driving through the city, there's not a huge amount of visible damage. There's some damage to houses and buildings, but it's not as visual as the Haiti earthquake (of 2010). We were able to drive the main road to the hotel we're staying at, but they're not allowing anyone inside because of the aftershocks. The guests are in a big tent used for functions on the lawn. People are squeezed in. There are probably about 100 people in there. The tents are covered, but water is seeping in from streets puddled with water, especially around the edges of the tent. So people are outside in the rain with no shelter. It's visually stark, with people in the streets. It's colder than usual this time of year. I'm cold and damp. When it's almost May, it's usually much hotter. There's very little power in the city -- no power to speak of, no drinking water. For the residents, it's really bad. Very soon, they will need shelter. Temporary shelters have been put up, but very few -- 16 -- by the government. It looks like a city where buildings have been abandoned. People are hanging out in public squares and at intersections to avoid rubble from buildings. Those who survived -- and those who didn't . There are issues with fuel in the city, and driving in, all the stores were shuttered. You occasionally see a cart with food or a few bottles of drinking water, but for the most part, nothing is being sold in the city. I don't think they're very concerned about looting, and there's no military in the streets, but they will have to get water and food in the city soon. Communal kitchens have been set up for cooking. Not by the government -- people set them up on their own. People are beside themselves in shock. Their biggest concern now is the structures, needing a place for shelter, to hide from the elements and sleep. Food will become the biggest concern in the coming days. Kathmandu isn't the epicenter though. No one's sure what it's like at the epicenter. People haven't been able to get to outlying areas. We haven't been able to corroborate this, but the people we're talking to here say there's damage to the villages outside Kathmandu -- thousands of houses damaged to the north, closer to the epicenter. CNN's Ingrid Formanek reported from Kathmandu and Mark Morgenstein wrote in Atlanta."
"The judge in Brooklyn denied a motion by the US Justice Department to get Apple to unlock a phone in a drug case.
In an unrelated case, the FBI wants Apple to unlock the iPhone of Syed Rizwan Farook, who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California in December.
But Apple has resisted, calling that demand ""dangerous"" and ""unprecedented"".
The ruling in Brooklyn on Monday centres on the same point as the San Bernardino case.
The two court cases are not linked - the magistrate in San Bernardino doesn't have to pay any attention to the ruling and remarks from the New York judge.
But Apple feels the decision in New York gives added strength to its position. A senior Apple spokesman told reporters in a conference call that he was confident the San Bernardino judge would carefully analyse the New York ruling.
Most promising for Apple is the reason for which Judge Orenstein threw out the New York case.
He said he was not at all convinced the All Writs Act, a law more than two centuries old, could be used to force Apple to comply. The same law is being used in San Bernardino.
The All Writs Act is designed to give law enforcement powers not specifically addressed in other laws - but using it requires meeting certain strict criteria, too burdensome to detail here.
No legal precedent has been set here - but as the magistrate in San Bernardino considers her ruling, momentum certainly appears to be with the computing giant.
Apple v the FBI - a plain English guide
Apple's boss hits back at FBI conduct
Bill Gates calls for terror data debate
Fourteen people were killed and 22 injured when gunman Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik opened fire in the Californian city in December.
A court order in California demanded Apple help circumvent security software on Farook's iPhone, which the FBI said contains crucial information.
Apple's CEO Tim Cook said the request was ""an overreach by the US government"" and risked giving authorities ""the power to reach into anyone's device to capture their data"". Last week, the company asked a court to overturn the ruling.
The same Act from 1789 that was used by the FBI in the San Bernardino request was applied in the Brooklyn case. But Judge James Orenstein said the Act was not applicable in this case, adding that it was not right to impose ""on Apple the obligation to assist the government's investigation against its will"".
The US Justice Department said it planned to appeal against the Brooklyn ruling."
"The Seasiders struck with the first real chance after 12 minutes as Nathan Delfouneso jinked past his man and delivered a pinpoint chip into the area, where Jamille Matt turned the ball home from three yards.
Blackpool goalkeeper Sam Slocombe denied Matthew Briggs with a sensational save to push the ball behind after 17 minutes, but the visitors did equalise from the resulting corner as Kurtis Guthrie prodded in from close range after a goalmouth scramble.
Somehow, Colchester failed to re-take the lead on the stroke of half-time as Slocombe produced a brilliant save from George Elokobi's close-range effort, before Guthrie headed against the bar from two yards.

"His is one of dozens of cases opened by authorities in a crackdown on condoning or threatening terrorism.
Justice Minister Christiane Taubira said words of hatred and contempt had to be fought with the ""utmost vigour"".
Dieudonne already has convictions for inciting anti-Semitism and the courts banned several one-man shows last year.
A judicial source quoted by AFP news agency said he was due to be released on Wednesday evening but would face trial at a later date.
The justice ministry said earlier that 54 cases had been opened since the murders of 17 people in Paris last week. Of those, 37 cases involved condoning terrorism and 12 were for threatening to carry out terrorist acts.
Some fast-track custodial sentences have already been handed down under anti-terror legislation passed last November
The justice minister said prosecutors should act firmly and quickly against anyone found condoning terrorism or carrying out racist or anti-Semitic acts.
Dieudonne is already facing an inquiry into whether he condoned terrorism in a video in which he mocked the decapitation of US journalist James Foley by Islamic State militants.
If found guilty, he could face up to seven years in jail and a â‚¬5,000 (Â£3,800; $5,900) fine.
Hours after 3.7 million people took part in rallies across France on Sunday, with the biggest in the centre of Paris, Dieudonne said on his Facebook page that the ""historic"" march had been as magical as the Big Bang that had created the universe.
""I'm finally going home,"" he wrote. ""Know that this evening, as far as I'm concerned, I'm feeling like Charlie Coulibaly [French:  je me sens Charlie Coulibaly].""
He combined the ""Je suis Charlie"" (""I am Charlie"") slogan adopted across the world in support of the 17 victims of the Paris attacks with the name of one of the three Paris gunmen, before deleting the remark a short time later.
Coulibaly killed a policewoman near a Jewish school last Thursday before going on to hold up a kosher supermarket the following day when he murdered four Jewish hostages.
Dieudonne's comment drew an angry response on Monday, with Prime Minister Manuel Valls saying that freedom of speech should not be confused with anti-Semitism, racism and Holocaust denial.
After Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said he had asked the authorities to investigate Dieudonne's remarks, the comedian posted a response on his Facebook page, arguing that he was being treated as public enemy number one when all he wanted to do was make people laugh.
""I'm being seen as an Amedy Coulibaly when I'm no different from Charlie,"" he said.
The murders at Charlie Hebdo by the Kouachi brothers were widely seen as an assault on freedom of speech, on a magazine that has frequently launched withering attacks on religion, with depictions of the Prophet Muhammad.
The publication of a new issue of Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday was so sought-after that the publishers increased the print run to 5m copies.
Dieudonne's detention immediately drew claims of double standards from some quarters in France.
But French daily Le Monde pointed out (in French) that French law limited freedom of speech and it did not extend to incitement to hatred or racism, anti-Semitism and homophobia.
In 2007, the then editor of Charlie Hebdo, Philippe Val, was cleared of inciting hatred against Muslims for reprinting cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.
Dieudonne was himself acquitted last year over comments made in a video in which he called for the release of a man who tortured and murdered Ilan Halimi, a Jewish man, in Paris in 2006.
His trademark ""quenelle"" gesture has been criticised as an inverted Nazi salute although he argues it was intended to be anti-establishment."
"Mr Drumm, who resigned in December 2008 as the bank was collapsing, was brought before Dublin District Court on Monday to be charged with 33 offences.
They include false accounting linked to transactions worth 7bn euros (£5.4bn).
He was arrested in the early hours of Monday after arriving at Dublin Airport on an overnight flight from Boston.
Gardaí (Irish police) accompanied the former chief executive on the transatlantic flight and shortly after landing he was brought to a Dublin police station, and then escorted to the court.
The hearing was told that Mr Drumm made no reply when police officers put the charges to him at the station.
Sixteen of the charges relate to the alleged provision of unlawful financial assistance to 16 wealthy investors, in a bid to prop up Anglo's share price before the collapse.
Mr Drumm moved to the US in 2009, the same year Anglo Irish Bank had to be bailed out by Irish taxpayers.
Police objected to his bail application, claiming the accused is a potential flight risk.
A sergeant told the court police believed Mr Drumm had the capacity to flee the jurisdiction and seemed to have access to large sums of money when required, despite owing millions in debts.
A prosecution lawyer told the court the accused had fought tooth and nail against his extradition from Boston and had been leading the authorities a ""merry dance"" during the process.
However, Mr Drumm's solicitor said his client had offered to surrender his passport, be tagged and sign on twice daily at his local police station.
The defence lawyer added that the accused had offered to provide a ""relatively large"" amount of cash and had several family members who were willing to ""put their houses on the line"" so he could be granted bail.
The judge granted bail on Mr Drumm's own bond of 50,000 euros (£39,000) and two independent sureties of 50,000 euros.
Mr Drumm ran Anglo Irish Bank from 2005 to 2008 and subsequently filed for bankruptcy in the US.
However, the bankruptcy bid failed and a Boston court ruled that he could be held liable for debts of 10.5m euros (£8.34m).
It was alleged during the bankruptcy case that the 48-year-old former bank boss secretly transferred money and assets to his wife, so they could not be seized during bankruptcy proceedings.
Authorities in the Republic of Ireland issued an extradition request last year and he was arrested at his American home in October.
At a hearing in Boston last month, Mr Drumm agreed to return to the Republic of Ireland as soon as possible.
Bailing out the bank cost Irish taxpayers about 30bn euros (£22bn: $34bn), close to one-fifth of annual output.
Its downfall played a large role in the collapse of the Irish economy in 2008 and the ensuing bailout from its eurozone partners two years later."

"From September, three and four-year-olds in England will be entitled to 30 free hours of care a week in term time.
But a Pre-school Learning Alliance poll of childcare providers suggests many will struggle to offer the 30 hours as the funding will not cover their costs.
Ministers say affordable childcare is at the heart of their agenda.
PSLA Chief Executive Neil Leitch said the plan could force nurseries to close
Of 1,332 childcare providers questioned last month, only 44.2% said they definitely planned to deliver the 30 hours, compared with 95.2% who said they were providing the 15 hours currently funded by government, while more than a third (36.5%) were unsure whether to offer it.
Almost a fifth (19.3%) said they would not be introducing it and more than half of those (58%) said it was because the funding was not high enough.
About two-fifths of nurseries and childminders said they would have to put restrictions on the days and times when families can take their free hours.
Of nursery owners expecting to make a loss under the scheme, more than half said they would have to increase fees for any additional hours.
More than a third (37.2%) said they would increase fees for children of other ages and nearly half (47.9%) would charge for goods and services that they previously provided for free.
More than half (59.7%) said they were confident that they would have the capacity to meet the demand for places under the 30-hour offer, while 40.4% said they were not.
Neil Leitch, chief executive of the PSLA, said: ""The promise of 30 hours of free childcare was a key part of the Conservative Party's pre-election manifesto and yet these findings show that if the government doesn't address the sector's funding concerns, it's at serious risk of breaking that pledge.
""With so few providers currently committed to delivering the 30 hours and so many forced to consider limiting places, raising fees or introducing extra charges in order to remain sustainable if they do offer it, many parents expecting easy access to a 'free' 30 hours place in September are likely to be disappointed.
""The fact is that the 30 hours offer cannot succeed without adequate investment. Neither parents nor providers should be expected to pay for a promise that government chose to make.""
A Department for Education spokeswoman said that by 2020 the government would be investing ""a record Â£6bn per year... in childcare support and introducing a fairer Early Years funding formula which will see the vast majority of providers receive increased funding rates to help deliver our 30 hours free offer"".
The spokeswoman added that pilots of the scheme were already successfully under way in a number of areas, with more due to launch this month.
""We are also providing guidance, tools and support for providers to help childcare professionals run their businesses more efficiently,"" she said."
"From slathering on potent face creams to treating a spot with teatree oil, most women attempt to clear problem skin with topical products. But should we be drinking our way to flawless skin? If the latest Japanese beauty trend is anything to go by, it seems so. The women of Japan swear by the 'beauty from within' philosophy and prefer to sip on tincture tonics to cleanse the system internally to encourage clear, unblemished skin. Japanese women swear by the 'beauty from within' philosophy and prefer to sip on tincture tonics to beat acne - and the beauty movement is coming to the UK . Indeed, Mahonia, a traditional herbal treatment for acne, is a number one bestseller in the East Asian nation, reports Neal's Yard Remedies, who has seen sales of its Mahonia Clear Skin Formula go through the roof online from customers there. Mahonia, which is also known as Oregon Mountain Grape, is a berry native to the Rocky Mountains that's been used by tribes for medicinal, food, and ceremonial needs for years. It contains high levels of alkaloids, berberine and hydrastine, which are active compounds that give it antibacterial and anti-inflammatory  benefits. Thanks to these benefits, mahonia has been used traditionally for skin itchiness, infections and irritations, and is highly recommended for acne.

The antibacterial compounds in this herb are berbamine and berberine, which are antiseptic when used topically. When used internally, these compounds are liver tonics that improve bile flow, stimulate digestion and act as a tonic on the bowel wall. Neal's Yard Remedies created a tincture packed with the stuff, as well as a purifying blend of the skin-loving botanicals calendula, schisandra and gotu kola. Gotu kola helps stimulate collagen and tissue formation. It improves circulation, which benefits skin tone, and  has anti-inflammatory and skin-regenerating actions. When used internally, mahonia can improve bile flow, stimulate digestion and act as a tonic on the bowel wall . Antimicrobial herb calendula is rich in anti-ageing antioxidant beta-carotene, which is important for healthy skin structure and renewal. Also known as magnolia vine, schisandra has been used historically for immune support and for skin care. Modern Chinese research suggests it has a protective effect on the liver, so enhancing the cleansing benefits. The succulent globe artichoke, meanwhile, has been used in Chinese medicine for millennia as a digestive cleanser. It helps to purify and calm the system from within. It is recommended to add 2ml to a cupful of water three times a day to reap the rewards."
