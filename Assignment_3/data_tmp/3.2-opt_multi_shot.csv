Summary 1: Global warming causes more severe droughts in the South, but rainfall will increase in much of Africa and Asia.
Summary 2: The driest places may suffer drought conditions up to five times in a century. But the heaviest rain will likely bring floods in the Pacific Northwest and California.
Summary 3: Water scarcity could increase food poverty for 2 billion people
Summary 4: New crop technologies have limits in the future.
Summary 5: Rising population in developing countries would contribute the most, because there will be more people eating at risk levels of water.

Global warming and crop problems
The global rise in temperature affects the growth of crops and changes how they are harvested. It also affects their nutrition, and impacts on people's health.

Global change and food security
Climate change may play a large part in making the number of people going hungry increase in the coming years as the amount of food produced continues to increase. The issue facing the agriculture industry is how to adjust to climate change.
Climate change alters the weather and rainfall patterns and the way humans harvest and produce food. Farmers and agriculture industries have to prepare themselves to change"

22083,2,"The global economy, grappling with a pandemic, a deteriorating economy and heightened geopolitical tensions, is facing unprecedented challenges.
The global coronavirus pandemic has had an immediate impact on the economy. Trade and travel have been severely disrupted since the beginning of the year and there is now less global money to spend. In addition to that, there are renewed tensions among some countries that could spill over to affect markets. At the same time, the climate emergency threatens new economic risks, and a slowdown in economic growth could set back environmental progress and result in higher costs for households.
The main driver of economic growth in the first half of the year was in the developed world, with a 4.3 per cent rate of growth for the US and 1.4 per cent for the eurozone. But even that was slightly below expected, given it was driven by high public consumption, supported by the stimulus packages designed to combat the pandemic and the collapse in oil prices. The situation in many emerging economies was far more challenging. As the pandemic spread, some were hit hard by measures to contain its spread, both those taken at the national and international levels as well as the measures taken by the private sector to avoid a collapse in consumer spending. The sharp contraction in demand led to severe"

In each case, the summary has two purposes: a) to summarize the article in plain text while preserving its main points and style (thus making it very easy and fast for a reader to follow it) and b) to use the summary in a subsequent article (with or without a title) to provide a general idea to a reader about the topic of that article. The article itself uses either a URL or a link shortener.

The vote is an effort by the opposition to block what they see as an unfair deal.
It follows news that the State was not taking part in a key element of the original EU-UK agreement, which meant that Ireland would have seen about €4bn in tariffs as a result of post-Brexit checks.
The opposition have said it is unlikely the government has the numbers to get its EU post-Brexit trade agreement legislation through the Dáil, but the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) said in the Dáil on Wednesday any opposition vote to delay legislative progress on the Trade Agreement will be a matter of confidence and supply for the government.
The Government has said there can be no EU-UK trade deal which doesn't respect the Good Friday agreement and that its agreement with the UK gives the government the political leverage to prevent British attempts to undermine the agreement in the future.

According to data released by China, the economy grew at a 6.8% pace in the first-quarter. That is the slowest pace of growth the world's second largest economy has managed in years. The slowdown is mainly on the back of the coronavirus outbreak. The data released on Tuesday morning also showed a drop in industrial production, retail sales and fixed-asset investment. The data also showed a decline in exports. China's exports dropped by 25.6% in March, marking their steepest fall in two decades. In fact, the Chinese economy overall has shown signs of slowdown for some time.

My concern is the following: I have already written my summaries in plain text, so I would have to re-write them again. If I can rewrite them in APA format, that would be great.

Background: Worldwide economic growth has slowed considerably over the past couple of years. According to the International Statistical Office (a division of the World Bank), global growth slowed from 3.1 percent in 2012 to just 2.3 percent in 2018. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered global growth estimates for 2020 from 2.9 percent to 2.4 percent. Many are linking these sluggish growth rates to an ongoing trade and technology war between the US and China. Others have speculated that a combination of economic and political unrest in the Middle East, with the resulting economic slowdown, may also be partly to blame.

 Abstract
Due to the COVID 19 pandemic, the world is facing some of its toughest times, with economic growth expected to contract by 4% in 2020 and an increase in poverty and inequality. The UK is seeing significant labour market impacts, with unemployment expected to surge and employment likely to be hit harder at low and lower skill levels. In addition, the government’s fiscal support programmes will need to be financed at substantial cost,"

The question is, can I use it as a title? It seems to convey a certain amount of information, more than a plain sentence. If not, what is the most natural plain-text summary statement?

A good start: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_sentence

The government has extended unemployment benefit, providing people with an extra 500 euros for three months.
An additional 500 euros was offered to families, which have seen income drop by more than 30 percent.
The government has continued to provide healthcare workers with free meals and coffee vouchers through the pandemic.
Government’s measures have helped businesses and their employees to survive the pandemic.
Small business loans have helped companies to stay afloat during this tough time. Businesses, such as fitness gyms, continue to struggle, as they are struggling to meet health guidelines.

The global economy slowed down considerably in all regions, with all sectors affected and a general economic slowdown.

This has resulted in the re-valuation of equity markets, while sovereign bond yields have declined, resulting in a narrowing of the risk premium. As a result, we see a further appreciation in investment-grade market bonds, while we prefer the lower-risk high-yield market. While we are cautiously optimistic on near-term policy support, there are signs of the economy losing momentum as the pandemic drags into the third quarter, with some economists reporting a contraction in Q2.''

The work on the space telescope will go forward without the shuttle, which will return to Earth Friday after a mission to the International Space Station. The space shuttle is, of course, a vital part of the agency's space program, and the space shuttles are in turn a vital part of the U.S. and world technology infrastructure. They represent a critical link carrying equipment to the space station. They're the only shuttles capable of delivering gear weighing more than 10,000 pounds. And they are used on such tasks as space station maintenance. But the agency's human spaceflight program is still grounded by a fleetwide grounding. That has left the space shuttles essentially parked at the launch pad. NASA's space shuttle fleet, including Endeavour, is on its way home to Cape Canaveral, Fla. For Atlantis and several hundred other items, that means they have no cargo to fill their cargo bay. They must wait for the next space shuttle mission, slated for early next year.

The key question is - What information does the user really need from summary text? What are the most important points?     My experience is that users care more about knowing that there's a problem (or at least, that a ""controversy"" exists) than about really getting into detail.
The main thing (in my opinion) is to simplify the analysis to allow the user to move more quickly and to understand the key issues.
One possible solution is to have a link to the full text of the article/article summary.    For example, you could have one line for each main point of the summary (or to each of the main concerns raised), and links to the full text of the article (or to the key arguments in the article)."

My problem : there is no mention of the fact that the economy is suffering from climate change. It is not the COVID-19 crisis that is causing the current problems in the economy but man-made climate problems.

I had tried to make a point about how it is misleading to give the impression that the crisis is due only to COVID-19 or geopolitical tensions when in fact the cause is climate change, but this is not possible because the plain-text summary is too short.

However, the impact of these crisis is also felt by low-income countries, which usually tend to be impacted the hardest and most rapidly.

Then on to the summary sentence.
Article: ``"
69510,1,"The coronavirus pandemic is the worst event to hit the global economy since 2008. And it is on a track that will have longer-lasting effects. Many businesses have closed their doors, millions are unemployed, and the US Federal Reserve has launched a record bond-buying program to support financial markets. The pandemic will reduce global output by 2.0 per cent in 2020. If the pandemic persists, global economic output will be 7.5 per cent lower in 2021 than it would have been otherwise. While this will take much longer than the downturns caused by past coronavirus outbreaks, it means that the pandemic could take more than a decade to normalize. A combination of social distancing, business closures, and a downturn in world demand will weigh heavily on the outlook for business investment. Governments can help boost investment by deploying fiscal policy and enacting reforms that are conducive to sustained growth. The global economy also needs trade to recover. Trade cannot play the same role until global uncertainty has receded. The pandemic has also pushed countries toward greater inequality. It has disrupted supply chains, increasing inflation for lower-income households and making it more difficult to meet basic necessities. Governments should consider all possible policy options, including fiscal and monetary measures, to help"

69510,3,"The world has never seen a global health pandemic on this magnitude.' This is the official summary of an article by  Mia De Graaf, which  is also available online. At its heart there is a global political struggle in the making.''

It may be that the summary of Mia De Graaf has been given top billing because it contains the phrase ""on this magnitude"".  Yet the article actually says very little about that political struggle, and indeed much less about COVID-19 than the headline suggests. If the summary is given top billing because it is the one that is quoted in the ""Article"" box, then it does not appear to be justified by the article itself.

However, the Chancellor is hoping that an unprecedented public spending package (announced in July) will be enough to spur a sharp recovery.
  Summary: `Despite the scale of the decline, the Chancellor believes the Budget package is sufficient to stave off any risk of a double-dip recession in the UK. Unemployment has reached 7.8%, but is set to fall again after August, the Chancellor said. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warns that Britain remains in an “unprecedented situation” and that the government’s record rescue efforts will not be enough to avoid “major damage” to the economy.
`The OBR expects the economy to shrink by between 8 and 10% in 2020-21.

Article: Following the July Budget, banks will have to pay an 8% tax charge on profits of more than Â£25m, starting next year.
At the same time, the bank levy, which affects the larger banks, will be gradually reduced.
But the small banks argue that the new tax will harm their ability to lend money, and they want it reformed.

Coronavirus pandemic is having a 'terrible' impact on the global economy, with no clear end in sight, the International Monetary Fund said Monday. The IMF's outlook is significantly more pessimistic than it was in April. It sees the global economy shrinking 5.2 percent this year -- a historic contraction that would mark the steepest downturn since the Great Depression. Last month, the agency predicted a 3.0 percent decline.

What is the difference between a paraphrase and a summary?

A paraphrase is when the writer explains or paraphrases the content in a sentence or paragraphs, e.g. ```The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. Economic growth has slowed considerably across both developed and developing nations. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are exacerbating economic inequalities, making it harder for low-income families to afford basic necessities. Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth.```

In the above example, a summary is the content of the full source text in a shorter form, e."

The coronavirus pandemic has put enormous pressure on international supply chains and the local economy has now taken a drastic turn for the worst with further economic disruptions likely. The current climate and the ongoing trade and geopolitical issues across the globe are major risks to growth. Given the severity of these challenges it calls for a more holistic approach for policymaking. The government needs to focus on providing stimulus measures that are sensitive and inclusive in nature to mitigate the risk of further inequality which will further reduce the growth potential of the entire economy. As most economic indicators are in recession, the government has to work on stabilizing the economy. This requires the government to ensure that its policies are supportive of economic growth that ensures recovery''."

11842,2,"The global economy, especially developing economies, is facing unprecedented challenges due to the cumulative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. In addition, governments and businesses have responded to these challenges with a cocktail of fiscal, monetary, and policy policy interventions. The effects of all these measures are being felt in very different ways. In a recent report, the IMF noted that “GDP growth might contract sharply, with the crisis hitting advanced economies and emerging markets and developing economies at different times and in different ways.” While “most advanced economies have weathered the crisis—so far—in a much more resilient manner than emerging markets,” which are also facing a “distinct group of challenges,” some emerging economies will see their economies contract by 5 percent this year, the Fund estimates. To help minimize the economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak, many economies have rolled out fiscal stimuli. In the U.S., for example, Congress has approved a relief package that totals nearly $3 trillion. Meanwhile, the Bank of England (BoE) has intervened aggressively to pump extra liquidity into the country’s financial system. On the monetary policy front, the ECB and the U.S. Federal"

11842,4,"Mark Zuckerberg's (pictured) Facebook last year funnelled earnings into the Cayman Islands via Ireland in order to pay only a fraction in tax on more than £800million of overseas profits. As a result less than £240,000 was paid to the UK taxman. The Dublin office, with a staff of 400 people showed a gross profit of £840million in 2011. Despite this, Facebook Ireland posted a loss of £15million for the year after hundreds of millions were routed to a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands and to its parent company in the U.S. Labour MP John Mann recently spoke out about the company's actions, calling them 'disingenuous and immoral'. 'They benefit enormously from the country's internet infrastructure but do nothing to fund it. It's like driving a car with no tax. We would stand for it on our roads so why stand for it on the net?,' he said. Accounts for Facebook Ireland revealed that last year £440m was moved into an Irish sister company before being diverted to a subsidiary company in the Cayman Islands.

Investors are concerned about weak Chinese data and are also worried about the implications of a second wave of infections, with the virus appearing to resurge in several countries. In the US, where coronavirus cases rose by more than 65% over the weekend, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is considering a plan to restrict business activity. But the US Senate has failed to reach an agreement to pass a new fiscal stimulus package. This comes as European Union finance ministers failed to agree on the terms of a rescue package for the bloc's most vulnerable members, leaving a trillion euros worth of emergency loans and payments still unsecured and without an agreed date for a deal.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the global recession are having a profound impact on individuals and organizations across communities and economies worldwide. The current pandemic is expected to have a substantial negative impact on life expectancy and health in the short-term. In the medium-term, countries with poor health systems will face more economic and social challenges, particularly the “least-developed countries.” Health economists have projected that, if current trends in health inequality are left unaltered, it is expected to cost the global economy trillions of dollars this year."

33304,1,"The global economy is in an economic and geopolitical crisis, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change.
Economic growth and international trade are slowing and in some areas are already in a recession. In the United States, growth has been negative since the first month of the pandemic, and only last quarter it was -23%. For Europe, growth will also be negative for the whole of 2020, although it rebounded in the last quarter by 3.3% – one of the few positive numbers in a dark year. In the UK, growth declined -24%, for the worst number since quarterly records were first kept in the 1970s, while in the EU, growth is expected to be -10%.
In addition, the pandemic put a damper on demand for oil and other goods and services that have led to large trade deficits. In addition to the economic downturn, countries that have benefited from the trade deficit – mainly China and the United States – are facing pressure from their foreign competitors.
Some measures to reduce the deficit were announced on Monday, including the imposition of import tariffs on metal products from EU countries, retaliating against similar tariffs Trump had declared on European exports earlier this year in a trade war that threatens to further diminish"
33304,2,"The economic future for humanity looks challenging on every front. In addition to the impact of the coronavirus on humanity and the economy, political tensions and the growing divide between rich and poor are also a cause for concern, particularly regarding climate change. Global growth is faltering under the impact on the global supply chain. Food prices are continuing to climb, and inflation is rising. At the same time, climate change is a global problem, although the poorest are the most exposed. The economic future for humanity looks challenging on every front. In addition to the impact of the coronavirus on humanity and the economy, political tensions and the growing divide between rich and poor are also a cause for concern, particularly considering the impact of climate change on our future. In this regard, a strong global commitment is needed for climate action, as envisaged by the Paris Agreement, and that includes financial flows to poor countries. Moreover the implementation of the UN Agenda 2030 on sustainable development and eradiction of poverty is essential to limit global imbalances and reduce inequalities. The COVID-19 crisis also shows the importance of social safety nets and health protection systems. Thus a global social contract is needed for more resilient societies.

38546,1,"There is a clear political change when it comes to the UK. However, for the Conservative conference, we are seeing another change: the focus on the Conservative and Unionist Party. And that in itself has been very interesting to watch.
The Tory conference has traditionally been the place for the party to declare its policies and to lay out its ideology; traditionally it has been a very much Westminster event. But the Conservative conference this time, to me, feels very much like a local party conference. Theresa May is clearly very conscious of the changes in what this party is now representing.
The policy announcements are not about what this government is going to do. They are about the future of the Conservative Party and what it is up to. And those announcements are not at all just about Brexit and the future of the Union, but they are very much about the future of the Conservative Party.
The policy changes that we are seeing are far more to do with the future of the party than the government. The new economic policy, for example, is not a policy about economics, it is about the Conservative Party's economic policy. If you don't see that, then you're not seeing the whole conference.
And what this means is an even firmer party focus on the Union"

A question might be -- Is there any reason why the US needs to be so generous as ""toss money at problems"" (for instance, for health care); or why the Russians might need to borrow money for their problems?

Yes, this is basically the idea behind macro (macroeconomics) theory.
For more detail than this, look into how the economy works.

You should also look at the other side of that coin: why is it so easy to be so generous with other countries that don’t always reciprocate?
It’s nice to help people in need, but at some point it’s not in our financial interest to help everyone.

Well, why should the fact I don’t know the economic situation in Russian make you right?

Facebook also alleges that the summary was written by Mara while Mara was in the U.S. illegally, and that he created false contact information for an immigration lawyer after he was apprehended by police.

The global economy is now set for a considerable slowdown due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions and climate change on emerging and advanced economies alike, says a special report issued by the Brookings Institution, the world's premier think tank of global development and diplomacy. The projections made by the economists at the Brookings Institution project that global growth will slow down from 3.2 percent in 2019 to 2.1 percent in 2020. The economic impact of the outbreak has been far-reaching; it has led to a plunge in global oil prices and an expected collapse of commodity prices, especially for agricultural products, in the coming quarters. In the context of these developments, the economic downturn will reverberate through the global financial system, impacting on the ability of the developing and transition economies to respond to the COVID-19 challenges. The economists believe that the pandemic-driven economic downturn will be exacerbated by the geopolitical stressors that have been in play for years, namely growing tensions between the United States and its allies in a range of global hotspots, including with Iran—which are now exacerbated by the withdrawal of the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (J"

17694,3,"The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges, including the combined impact of COVID-19 pandemic; geopolitical tensions; and climate change. The negative impact on both supply chain and consumption has caused severe hardship for many.
Government responses have been varied. In many developed countries (e.g., the US), fiscal stimulus has been massive and has helped stabilize markets and economic conditions. In some emerging markets, large fiscal stimulus is not possible.
In a growing number of cases, governments have been forced to increase taxes or implement austerity measures leading to higher unemployment. Many governments are also facing budget deficits. In such cases, the need for increasing funding, increasing debt and increasing debt servicing has become an imminent challenge. The ability of developing countries in mitigating the impact of covid 19 is of great concern. With a growing global population, climate-related risk is set to grow and pose severe challenges for many countries.
Government action, including stimulus and policy reform, must be taken across a broad range of sectors ranging from agriculture to finance to education to healthcare. A mix of fiscal measures and monetary easing are likely to be the most effective. However, many of these measures will need to be maintained over a longer period.

Solution Description

We can write another summaries that summarises these summaries:"
23354,1,"The following statements were included in the latest World Economic Outlook (WEO), which was released by the International Monetary Fund. The IMF has revised downward its growth projections for 2021 and 2022 because ""a number of high-income economies (HIEs) are experiencing a more prolonged contraction than originally anticipated."" More than half of the members of the group that are considered HIEs -- China, the US, Germany, India, Japan, South Korea -- have witnessed sharp downward revisions. However, low-income economies are being hit the hardest by the slump: Brazil, Russia, Mexico and South Africa are experiencing contractions that now exceed 10 percent. Moreover, most countries in this group saw an increase in the rate of people out of work, and the level is expected to stay high even after the current contraction is over.
In its Global Economic Prospects and Prospective Trade Policy Dilemmas report, the Fund highlights the key challenge facing many countries: ""High debt and limited policy space prevent countries from effectively implementing large fiscal stimulus plans."" Instead, the report's authors propose some ideas on where to focus attention, and highlight the importance of better coordination and policy coherence. However, the Fund argues, ""the importance of fiscal space is declining, as the world is experiencing"
23354,2,"COVID-19, geopolitics, climate will create `historic challenge` for global economy"" --  A global economic slowdown, with rising inequality, higher inflation and political uncertainty, is forecast as the world faces the combined impact of four trends -- COVID-19, geopolitical tensions, climate change and social instability, a new report warned on Monday.
A report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic -- which has seen the sharpest contraction in the global economy since 2008 -- could spark a double-dip recession in many countries this year.
The OECD's Economy Week 2020, which included an online presentation by OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria, a virtual meeting of finance ministers, and a policy dialogue on investment, ""found that the economic crisis could be the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s, which resulted in the onset of a lasting financial crisis, marked by record debt levels and high unemployment, that lasted seven years,"" the report said.
The report found that the contraction in 2020 may reach 4.2 percent due to COVID-19, with the number of people out of work surging to more than 110 million.
""In just a few weeks, the pandemic caused an"
23354,3,"Global challenges are intensifying: economic growth has slowed considerably in both developing and developed nations. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures have worsened economic inequalities.
Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal and monetary stimulus to stabilize markets and foster sustainable economic growth. A global financial crisis may ensue if more stimulus is not forthcoming.
Global trade is particularly vulnerable to the combined effects of COVID-19, geopolitics, and climate change. Major economies appear to be entering an economic downturn and there are early warning signs of a sharp slowdown in European and US economic activity.
Rising demand for long-term assets, particularly those with negative yield, have elevated government bond yields even further and contributed to a strengthening of the US dollar. This has been accompanied by a depreciation of emerging market currencies.
The combined impact of these forces increases the risks of a financial crisis in the next six to 12 months. Policymakers will need to respond rapidly to prevent a prolonged slowdown in economic growth, and potential downturn in financial markets.```

Economic growth has slowed significantly in both developed and developing countries, as the COVID-19 pandemic has hit every region of the world, but most significantly in the advanced economies and in emerging and developing markets. Faced with these challenges, governments throughout the world are responding with both fiscal and monetary policy stimulus packages. These measures aim to reduce the economic hardships caused by Covid-19, limit its financial impact on households and businesses, and promote sustainability and support for the green transition for a long-term healthier global economy. They are complemented by international efforts to combat ongoing geopolitical tensions as well as climate change. In this context, OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria and OECD Chief Economist Laurence Boone will present in Paris today their outlook for a robust global economic recovery.

The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it sees a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook consistent with its dual mandate. In addition, the Committee announced that it will begin to reduce its holdings of agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities and of securities guaranteed by the states and U.S. agencies starting later this year by not purchasing additional agency MBS or state and agency securities after September 30. The Committee currently expects to hold those securities holdings at current levels at least through late 2016. The Committee agreed to continue its longer-run goal, articulated in June 2008, of maintaining an accommodative federal funds rate while it is likely that economic output will remain"

How will this work in practice?
- We could implement the idea of the news article by scraping news sources, and then parsing and rendering the articles automatically.
- This would require a bot (or a group of humans) to keep up with every news article that is published every day and then parse and render each and every line.
- This would be great during the time in which news articles are published and made freely available online, but would we go about this? Should I post the idea in the github repo discussion. Please do comment on this.

34932,3,"The Global Economy - Global economic challenges, from growing inequality, climate change, geopolitical tensions to declining productivity, are putting pressure on growth and investment, and raising questions about the durability of the current multi-decade expansion. For the first time in recent memory, a number of macroeconomic headwinds are interacting, complicating prospects for growth. While a number of these headwinds have been building for a while, they appear collectively to be creating a global economy operating far below capacity. The challenge is to generate and sustain investment to drive strong sustained growth, while also making progress on improving social fairness, resilience and sustainability. Macroeconomists predict that real (inflation-adjusted) GDP growth will be weaker in 2020 than in 2019. The global expansion has also been characterized by high labor-market and financial sector volatility, which have eroded business and consumer confidence -- and put downward pressure on growth. Low investment in the advanced economies has contributed to anemic productivity. In the emerging and developing economies, growth has been slow, in part due to weak global demand. Trade growth has also remained weak for many advanced economies, while rising trade tensions have dampened investment prospects. The combination of a soft manufacturing sector in the wake of trade tensions and financial constraints is generating a large cyclical"

The first is to ascertain whether you are injured - there is no problem if you are only a little shaken up.   But if you are injured, you will have a problem and the person who is hurt in the collision would want to know how to get medical and legal advice and assistance because he or she has a right to go to hospital for medical attention and to have a report drawn up from a qualified doctor.    Secondly, it would be useful if you knew where you had got hurt in your body because once you have an idea of the extent of the injury and which part you have injured in the collision, you can take medical advice to the extent that it can be obtained from the emergency services.

Solution: To do a 200 word summary for an article means that you should have had to read the entire piece at least twice. If you have not had time to read it completely, then you should have not attempted to do a summary. The person who is supposed to be evaluating my writing must have read each and every paragraph to come up with the information needed to write the report.

Can you come up with a sentence that does both of the following: 1. Is accurate 2.  Is a summary of the article.  You have the ability to choose one from the article, but not both.
The first part is easier: you can say that the article says that the global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change, and that economic growth has slowed considerably across both developed and developing nations (as well as in the United States).  You can then say that the summary says that the article says that economic growth has slowed considerably across both developed and developing nations, but the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately hurt poorer communities.

As suggested by the summary, these issues have global consequences.

The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to all the factors highlighted. The crisis in many ways will be permanent since even the worst-case scenario that includes a major global recession and a high inflation scenario has led to a massive decline in global debt. It is hard to imagine that there will be a significant reversal in this trend. Indeed, most economists and policymakers see a permanent increase in global debt levels to levels seen in the aftermath of World War II. However, the problem will be far from simple since the crisis of 2009 took a decade to reach the final stages of recovery. Therefore, a very similar time horizon applies to the current crisis.

  Sub-Summary:
--The Vatican City police yesterday arrested a former butler accused of stealing sensitive papers, including the keys to the Pope's desk, police said.
---Benedict's butler has admitted trying to sell the secrets to Italian journalists.
---The arrest of Paolo Gabriele is likely to further damage the Vatican's credibility.
---An Italian bishop says that Gabriele had been hired to work directly with Benedict.
---Pope Benedict calls a three-week synod of bishops starting this Sunday to focus on ""the new evangelisation"".
---The case was overshadowed by the Catholic Church's announcement that one of its top officials, Monsignor Joseph Ratzinger, was named a cardinal and to succeed John Paul II as pope.
---The synod on evangelism is likely to spark controversy.
---The first cardinal is not expected to be announced until next week.

98726,2,"The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. Growth has slowed dramatically over the last year, causing economic inequalities to increase making it more difficult for low-income families to afford basic necessities.

Governments on both sides of the Atlantic have responded to these challenges with a mix of fiscal stimulus, policy reform, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth.

The global economy is set to get off to a difficult start this year, reflecting the expected impact of new Covid-19 lockdowns and supply chain disruptions related to the ongoing pandemic. The European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, estimated last week that Europe's economy will shrink 6 percent this year. The United States is expected to grow by only 3.5 percent in 2021, down from its January outlook of 4.2 percent.

The World Bank this year plans to allocate $100 billion in financing for global health efforts through the end of 2023; on the ground, the Biden administration has vowed to spend billions of dollars in new programs focused on combating the pandemic, while the EU has announced a €750-billion ($859-billion) recovery fund"

 Article: The three-day festival at Riga City Hall in Latvia that featured the works of Russian singer-songwriter Oleg Varkulichov, whose music has long been banned, was one of the most talked-about political events in Europe.
In the past 20 years, Latvia has managed to emerge from behind the Soviet bloc to become a member of the European Union, has changed its currency and established diplomatic relations with Russia.
But the fact that an event with a Russian cultural figure at its center was deemed worthy of public attention suggests much in a country that is still struggling to shed the label of “Soviet-born”, where the language remains Latvian and the culture Russian.
Some are saying this year's festival, a follow-up of sorts to the first in September, was the most significant in decades for exposing more public to cultural, political and economic ideas from the west without necessarily adopting them.
```For the majority of people, the event took place only symbolically and they thought, why should I care?,'' Andrei Kozlovskis, political science professor at the University of Latvia, told Reuters ahead of the festival,"

What's the problem with this example?

1) The summary is not in the most logical sequence. ""Unlocked"" (the first part of the summary) precedes ""global economy."" The last sentence of the summary (```governments worldwide are responding with measures''`) is a list of possible solutions and thus does not need to be included. The list of possible solutions is too long, so it can be omitted. (The last line of text in the whole summary can be omitted).

2) In the summary, the statement ```The global economy is struggling due to COVID-19, geopolitical tensions, and climate change, leading to slower growth, supply chain issues, and increased inequality.'' is quoted.  The reader has a sense of what is going on and what the summary is about. All that it needs at this point is some evidence   that supports the statement. For example, a link to a"

I'd actually favor either text above rather than a web page on the subject (if possible), because it may come across better.  And it'd work well if the article actually said that in the first place.

This is particularly evident with QE tapering, although the Fed has announced that this can be revisited at any time should circumstances change. Given that the stock market has rallied, investors are pricing higher earnings and higher returns.

World tennis tournaments
There are also many other tennis tournaments worldwide each year, but the ones listed below are the most popular. These may be of interest, because some are considered to be major tournaments, and some attract top players.

This list excludes any and all of the following:

World Tour Grand Slam
The year-end World Tour tournaments are ATP World Tour 1000 (tournament finals only), the Davis Cup, and the Fed Cup.

At the lower tier of these tournaments, which is known as ATP 500s and ATP 250s, each country gets one entry to the ATP 500 tournament finals, as does each ATP 250 tournament's home city. These tournaments may be combined, usually on a two-year basis, based on ranking points.

World Tour Masters 1000
These are tournaments which are part of the top-level ATP World Tour, but are not Grand Slam events, i.e. the ATP World Tour Finals and the Miami Open. The Masters 1000 circuit includes the Masters 1000 event finals and the Masters 1000"

The global economy, now being affected by the COVID 19 virus, as well as wars and natural disasters, is experiencing the worst recession since World War II. A pandemic has been identified in China, with a death toll of thousands and spread to the United States and other countries. There is a possibility that the economic recovery in 2020 will not exceed 2%. On this background, the article examines the future of trade and its consequences. In addition, it examines the possibility of economic growth in view of geopolitical pressures, due to the influence of the US and its strategic allies; and the possibility of a collapse of the European Union as a result of the Brexit referendum, which resulted in the division of the UK.

There has been a marked strengthening in economic activity in 2013, with the global economy expected to expand more rapidly over the coming years than previously anticipated. However, global developments remain highly uncertain. Political instability in some countries threatens to derail a process of recovery. The slowdown in emerging market (EM) growth in 2013 has put further pressure on the international monetary system, and this has been intensified by the continuing difficulties faced by the eurozone. Fiscal consolidation efforts remain important for restoring health to public finances and safeguarding future living standards. This outlook is consistent with our global economic outlook. Growth in most advanced economies is on track and appears stronger, with a pickup in business investment being most pronounced. However, growth in high-income economies is expected to remain subdued compared with the levels seen more than a decade ago, reflecting in part the ageing of the global population. The IMF expects real growth to accelerate gradually to 2.9% in 2014, 3.0% in 2015 and 3.1% in 2016, from 2.5% in 2012.

Given the following example of an article and it's summary.
`   ```  `   In the face of widespread global economic problems stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, there are still people everywhere who still insist on being optimistic. While they know it’s not very likely -- to put it mildly -- that the end of times really is nigh, they still believe that one day in the near future things will change for the better, or at least that there’s no way for things to go much worse. Their attitude could seem irrational to some, especially after all the problems we have seen since the beginning of the year, from a stock market meltdown to rising unemployment, but there’s no way around it -- it all depends on who you talk to.
`   `  To understand these people, one needs only think back to the times when the world -- yes, the entire planet -- seemed united and at peace, when we were still the good guys and when we used to be “one.” They believe that the world is in crisis right now, but not because we have an enemy that can"

 Article: In what could be the most contentious debate to date over the use of AI, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg has said the social media giant has ""no interest"" in helping political parties target the ads it runs.
Speaking at Georgetown University in Washington on Friday, Mr Zuckerberg was unapologetic for the fact that targeted advertising was the main driver of Facebook's enormous profits, saying: ""We believe strongly in free expression and that anyone on our platform should be able to speak freely and express themselves.""
But he added that a new set of rules should apply to ""political ads"" on the platform.
""Most people don't want people to be able to pay to influence elections, so that goes beyond free expression,"

We expect the United States to experience slightly faster growth than the global average, as fiscal measures continue to prop up the economy. We forecast that China will experience a deep contraction, while the eurozone will contract by a cumulative 12.7% and Japan will suffer a 16.8% decline in GDP in 2020.

4221,2,"This global economic crisis, geopolitical tensions and especially climate change are putting unprecedented global challenges on global society. The crisis comes from the fact that the economy, the markets, the businesses - which are the foundations of modern capitalist society - are no longer working to solve society's problems. And these problems include poverty, unemployment and inequalities. The market system can do nothing about this. And it's no surprise, on this score, that the world is failing to solve these problems. What markets are really good at is creating profits for a select group of investors. And, right now, profits have to take a backseat. It's the duty of the government to ensure that profits don't take the backseat.```  I cannot agree with that.

A common way of presenting an article is to add a summary sentence without URLs or lists.

As a rule, the summary cannot include information known to be in the original article -- the links should be kept. But the summary can describe the content of the article -- this could include some extra information, like a photo, that is not present in the original article. The summary provides information that people with a lower literacy level than the article creator would prefer to see.

One good way of developing a summary is to compare it with the article. A great way to assess the summary is to compare it with the article without the summary.

In some cases, a summary will not have to include all of the information that can be found in the original article. A common format is to do a sentence or two summary of a general idea, and then include a link to the full content of the article."

It is an example of how to find a relevant article and to create a meaningful summary of it.

A very important question you need to consider when creating summaries for an article is a question often mentioned by our students: should you make a direct quote from the article into your summary?

You should never quote directly from article as that will make it obvious in your summary that you did not do the actual research for the article, making the whole exercise look more like a homework assignment than a summary. Instead, you should always link to the full article. This way you can show your students how to find the article and then find out what you need to know.

64209,1,"The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. Global growth slowed considerably during both the first and second quarters of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, some economies, mainly in East Asia, were adversely affected by the trade and geopolitical confrontations between the United States and China. Moreover, the global average growth rate in 2019 was almost 2 percentage points lower than in 2018, making it the slowest pace of expansion since the start of this century. In most countries, the impact of the pandemic is expected to worsen and spread over the rest of this year especially if effective treatment and a vaccine are not available in the short term. In the face of these challenges, governments worldwide are responding using a combination of fiscal measures, monetary policies, and public spending support packages (often funded through borrowing) aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth. ```

The pandemic is wreaking havoc on the global economy; we are beginning to fear for the worst. The spread of the virus is far from slowing down in the US or across the world. If people keep catching the virus, the economy will continue to deteriorate. The government is trying to contain the spread of the virus but is struggling immensely. We are running out of crucial supplies such as ventilators and masks, even though we are spending several billions of dollars on the same. The only solution to this is to implement a strict lockdown to suppress the spread. Lockdowns are causing severe problems to individuals and businesses. Individuals are losing their main source of incomes and businesses are closing down. Individuals may resort to stealing or breaking into businesses for survival. We must not ruin the economy, but we must protect our people. Countries such as Germany have implemented lockdowns and are successfully controlling the spread of the virus. We must follow their example. To control the spread of the virus it is important to implement strict lockdowns. For many countries, strict lockdowns do not provide an easy option, so people can understand the gravity of the situation. Unfortunately, many in India"

The resulting economic downturn and geopolitical tensions mean that the outlook for sustained growth is bleak. Given that the health and economic impacts of the pandemic are highly uncertain, governments must prepare for the possible negative impact of additional shocks on their economies as the virus transmits and spreads. While economic stimulus measures are widely known to be effective, the success of these policies is uncertain, as policymakers struggle to balance their attempts to increase market stability and support the economy with the need to avoid the excessive accumulation of public debt. Given that governments are facing financial pressures and that fiscal measures to support growth carry serious risks, other policies are needed to maintain or improve market stability, to enhance employment, to reduce inequalities"

Paraphrases often contain more details than a short summary since their primary job is to report more about the short-form text. Short summaries often contain fewer paraphrases since they are limited in length by length-limits.

When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, it caused an unprecedented economic, humanitarian, and social emergency. While the spread and trajectory of the pandemic varies from region to region, the long-term economic impact on developing economies is expected to be sizable and have lasting implications for these countries. In the United States, which has been relatively unscathed thus far, a $2 trillion-plus fiscal package was passed by the Senate and House of Representatives in March to help stabilize the economy and combat the effects of COVID-19. The fiscal package includes direct payments to most households, enhanced unemployment benefits, additional food assistance, support to small businesses and small nonprofits, as well as a range of other programs to boost business and consumer sentiment, and the supply chain. In developing countries, including the developing countries of Latin America, Asia, and Africa, many people have lost their jobs since the pandemic struck.

Article: James Milner is ready to shoulder extra responsibility at Manchester City with David Silva ruled out of the Manchester derby. Milner, arguably City’s best player this season, may be asked by manager Manuel Pellegrini to play in a more central role with City missing Silva’s creativity against United at the Etihad Stadium. The 28-year-old has played in nearly every outfield position during his career and would not be daunted by switching from wide to the centre if Pellegrini opts for one up front.

Perhaps we can't blame ourselves entirely for voting to leave, not with the propaganda that was being thrown around back then - ''Vote Leave'', ''Make Britain Great Again'', it's almost impossible to resist such campaigns. However, it was perhaps only to be expected when it is remembered how much had already happened in 2016 alone. We have seen what happened to the European Union by now that it seems almost impossible to blame the British for acting on what is perceived as a popular opinion. But now with these ''Brexit'' talks starting, one thing is clear, something we may only have seen in the past few weeks in the United States of America is that the people are being forced to make a choice between the status quo of being in the union or being in free trade agreements with the rest of Europe without being able to vote for or against them.

He spoke as a grand jury announced no charges for a white police officer who shot and killed the unarmed teenager.
The incident sparked a nationwide dialogue about race relations.
St Louis County Police spokesman Brian Schellman told US media on Tuesday authorities want to talk to Mr Head about his comments amid a larger investigation into arson and looting during the Ferguson protests.
Twelve commercial buildings were destroyed by fire that night, after the jury's decision was announced.
Family attorney Benjamin Crump has called Mr Head's recorded comments ""raw emotion"".
The officer who shot Brown in Ferguson, Darren Wilson, resigned from the force over the weekend.
The policeman said he had feared for his life, but Brown's supporters said the teenager was attempting to surrender when he was shot.
Some witnesses said the 18-year-old, who was unarmed, had his hands up.
The investigation into Mr Head comes one day after President Barack Obama requested $263m (Â£167m) to improve police training, pay for body cameras and restore trust in policing.

(The example given is for an article in a business journal/magazine. The example does NOT take account of style, length, or content considerations, so do not get too carried away.)

This approach helps the writer easily spot important facts while avoiding extraneous words, and it also helps the reader to quickly understand the intent behind the writing and quickly find the desired article. It is especially effective because the summary paragraph is in plain text, making it easy to copy and distribute to others. It is also easy to make a note in the margin as to who the writer is.

So is this a test case for an automated translation that can produce the summary in plain text?

They aren't very common for anything you wouldn't want to have an open licence, but they exist.
However the translation of an article isn't the same as the summary. With the summary, the idea is to summarize the article in a way that allows the site to be scanned and found via search. That doesn't usually happen with news unless it is something pretty serious. That's not the problem with translations. The summary needs to be a translation which reads like a summary. That is a different matter.
Also, summary are often created by non-native speakers who might still make occasional errors which end up with the article summary sounding a bit ridiculous. In other words, if your goal is to translate the summary into plain text in some machine readable format that won't be full of mistakes and which is understandable, that'd be great, but it'll take a lot of work to do that."

''An explanation
The article is from a well-known general interest news web site which is intended to inform and give opinion on a particular topic.  Each sentence is a summary of the article.  There is no mention of any URL's, lists of keywords (keywords are often used by computers as a way of classifying items into particular collections) or anything that would help the computer see what the article is all about.  (This information would have to be read by the computer which, as everyone knows, can't read English.)

Most article summaries in a news group (e.g. a discussion forum) are given exactly as the article is written. However, if the summaries are provided with URL's and lists of keywords then the computer is much better able to classify the topic and to be able to see where the summaries are coming from.

A very well written example.
This is a great chance of using this knowledge for a good case.

Given that the global economy is facing unprecedented challenges because of the combination of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change makes this an excellent choice.

The only problem is that many ""supply chain disruptions"" have been created by the COVID-19 pandemic.

This case is not that difficult. I suggest you do it. You will have a great example which you can use for a great and easy 5 hour presentation as well.

He claimed he had no access to a computer until recently and that he had no idea the photos had been taken while he was visiting the woman. Sheriff Norman McFadyen heard that Robert Anderson, from Edinburgh, was convicted of behaving towards the woman in a ""disgraceful and obnoxious"" way.
Anderson, 25, was originally accused of setting up several dummy Facebook accounts and publishing the images, which were taken when the woman was naked or in underwear in her home, including making recordings on a webcam and mobile phone. He was also accused of posting pornographic images on to Facebook of his own body. But the charges were dropped after Anderson's solicitor admitted he was on bail and would not have had access to computers, and they were not used to distribute the images. He was convicted instead of publishing the images, including making recordings on a tablet, which were on his own Facebook account and on his friend's Facebook account.
Sheriff McFadyen put Anderson on probation for two years and ordered him to complete 50 hours of unpaid work. The Sheriff warned Anderson that he faced being jailed if he breached the order."

 The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change.

Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are exacerbating economic inequalities, making it harder for low-income families to afford basic necessities. Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth.
The pandemic is the most severe shock to the global economy since the Second World War. The economic ramifications of this event are unprecedented. Global gross domestic product for 2020 is now forecast to plunge by 4.2% - the biggest fall in more than seven decades. The combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the social unrest seen in some countries is also adding uncertainty to the medium-term outlook for many countries. As a result, central banks are expected to maintain loose monetary conditions for longer, increasing the risk of persistently low inflation and rising consumer prices in the longer term.

In moments of crisis all over the world, large and small, people come to believe that when things are going badly something really scary is about to happen, and that no one can stop it from happening. In these moments fear, which turns to anger and then to powerlessness, replaces reason. When people no longer reason and they no longer respond, all that's left is violence.

Article:
''The global economy has been hit hard by the impact of geopolitical and climate change-related threats, leading to slower growth, supply chain disruptions, and increased inequality. As a result, countries are responding with a mix of fiscal stimulus, policy reform, and support packages. But these measures are complex to analyze, costly to implement, and uncertain to reap meaningful short-run benefits. The challenge in forecasting economic policy responses is that political leaders usually make decisions without considering the costs and long-term implications of their actions.

Summary: ``Growth slowed to just 0.1 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the first three months of the year, the joint-slowest pace during the ongoing pandemic. And there is little reason to think that growth will pick up much in the near future as the global economy remains fragile. Governments can play an important role in addressing this growing health crisis and strengthening the underlying economic foundations of a recovering global economy.''

In the above sentence the ```global economy'''' is the ```global economy''''. We can also say that the global economy has slowed down. The above sentence suggests that the global economy might have suffered due to the coronavirus, the political tensions etc. However, the above sentence is not completely true. The global economy actually is doing well as mentioned in the article, that is the reason that it is not slowing down. The global growth is almost 7% in 2019 and is likely to hover around this. That is why the global economy is facing ''unprecedented challenges''. That is why the global economy is not slowing down.

So the global economy is likely to be moving forward in an improving way with the present crisis.

 What are these sentences saying? To understand this, it's helpful to take a ""sentence structure"" look at each.

 Paragraph One
 Paragraph One  1. ```The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change.

Economic growth has slowed considerably across both developed and developing nations due to supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, and rising interest rates. Economies are struggling to navigate the evolving situation and the global recovery could take years, according to World Bank President David Malpass and Executive Director Axel van Trotsenburg.
The economic stimulus announced so far has provided a solid boost, but the global recovery is unlikely to be complete until the virus has been contained, they said.  The pandemic has highlighted risks that have been brewing for some time and exacerbated them, including inequality and climate change.
Governments worldwide are responding with a mixed array of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms and supportive measures aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth.

This example illustrates the technique the site has been using for a while : providing a headline summary of an article so that users can make their choice. In this case it is an article for which there exists a summary, that has not yet been translated, so that it may be useful to first view some of the source text before selecting the summary. But also it illustrates that there are a large number of articles available, where the summary is already well translated and is probably already used for a great deal of traffic.

In the context of a site that serves up multiple articles per page and only has to present the headline summary on the summary page a translation of the text would be a waste of time and bandwidth.

Economic growth has slowed considerably across both developed and developing nations. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary

As COVID19 continues to affect parts of the global economy, the recent economic activity data paints a grim picture.

There are some bright spots: a modest recovery is anticipated in advanced and developing economies, provided that the global recovery can be sustainable. However, the situation in many developing countries continues to be very fragile, and many governments still lack sufficient resources to deal with a second wave of COVID19 cases. This"

Economic challenges were evident in first quarter 2021, and a broad range of measures to support households and businesses have been adopted in many advanced as well as low-income economies. In developed economies, government fiscal and monetary policy measures – typically accompanied by spending and other financial support of the private sector – are critical instruments for stimulating investment and growth. In poorer countries, this response is more limited, and the World Bank estimates the response to date in developing economies is only a third of what’s needed.

The whereabouts of the two prominent clergymen, Greek Orthodox Bishop Paul Yazigi and Syriac Orthodox Bishop John Ibrahim, remain unknown, despite some reports to the contrary. But one activist in Syria and a member of the Syrian Orthodox Church said the kidnappings appeared to involve Syrian government forces, although that was not confirmed. Another activist, Rami Abdurrahman with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said his group believes the bishops were taken by non-Syrian rebels. Greek Orthodox Bishop Mousa Khoury told CNN that kidnappers seized the bishops Sunday after they met with members of the opposition Syrian National Council around the town of Maaret al-Numan in Idlib, on the border with Turkey, and said it was the first time the bishops had met with the rebels. However, the Syrian government said the bishops were seized by jihadists, including al Qaeda. The bishops were last heard from at least 24 hours ago, Khoury said.

Some of them are more worrisome for their consequences than for their implications, while others are only worrisome for their implications. Some may not even pan out in that order.  They are, in alphabetical order:

The first is that all of the energy industries at the most modest level are in some form of financial trouble. All of them have been losing money for several years now, though natural gas is in a particularly dire state.  Energy prices keep increasing and their demand has not kept up.  Many producers have taken on a lot of debt to fund new production.  There's a good deal of uncertainty about what prices will be for the foreseeable future.
The second is that a lot of the players, at all the minuscule levels, are in trouble.  Gas and mining companies, to name just two,  are facing financial problems that threaten their very existence.  Energy suppliers are having increasing difficulty passing along what they claim to be higher costs to consumers.
The third is that some of the players, usually those closest to the consumer - power generators - are facing increasing difficulty supplying the electricity consumers require.  There are a number of reasons for this, and all of them are"

In the winter of 1985, Paul Hudson travelled to Bradford from his home town of Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, for a weekend excursion with his uncle and a friend.
They had come to Bradford to look at potential new houses that Paul could buy for his aunty who was looking for a permanent roof over her family's head after being made redundant.
Paul was living at home since leaving university. He made it up as he went along in the world of work.
The previous autumn his dad had walked him through the process of filling in a housing application form, as well as one about tenancy applications.
But now they were well behind schedule in finding a property.

77198,3,"Global economic picture: slow growth, policy changes, climate change.

The article describes the general situation. It makes it clear that due to COVID the world economy as a whole is undergoing major problems. However, it could just be that some parts are more affected than others. The problem in this case is that supply chains have been disrupted for a lot of companies and consumers are now more reliant on the same few manufacturers.

This quote is also telling:

``  ```    The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges from geopolitical tension, climate change and the covid-19 pandemic.''

This last quote makes it clear that we have not yet made any significant progress in tackling climate change. We are simply not taking it seriously enough. There is no doubt that climate change is real and something must be done, but we are not doing that.

The second part, about policy issues, is the main content of this article. It lists the main problems that are facing businesses and governments.

For the links I can think of, I could even use the links in the summary sentence to create a table of contents-like section.

The other idea is to put the links on a mouseover-link only on the summary sentence.

Which way I should go for?
Some good reasons for either suggestions below.

One problem with using the list summary sentence in an article is that a link to the other sentence is made just above the list's summary sentence, which is not ideal. If that sentence or link is changed so that it is always seen on mouseover, then it becomes harder to use the other sentence without giving the impression that the summary sentence is incomplete. For example, if a summary sentence is: ""The global economy is struggling due to COVID-19"". Then the main title could be: ""COVID-19 pandemic causing economic issues""."

87898,1,"```The COVID-19 pandemic, political upheavals, and climate change are bringing the global economy to the brink of disaster. Global trade is in crisis - and so are the prices of everything from oil to chocolate. For many countries, the cost of living has soared, making it harder for people to afford essential goods.
  ```Faced with these grim circumstances, governments across the world are trying to contain the crisis by putting in place stimulus packages and taking other economic measures. And yet many still feel that their economies are in terminal decline. What is most urgently needed to revive economies at risk of collapse is broad-based growth that will deliver the resources and means required to confront the greatest global challenges.```

What are the implications of this?
This has huge implications for the global economy. It means that there will be fewer imports from China.
So other countries will be impacted.
A good example is how the Australian dollar has fallen.
It rose 0.5% on the day of the devaluation, but then fell 2.8% since. As of the close of business yesterday it was at USD$0.74.
It is likely to keep on falling in coming weeks as there are fewer imports from China. And the Aussie dollar is trading at about USD$0.700 right now.
There will not be many Aussies who will be smiling after that number.
So, the devaluations of China's currency mean that less money will be flowing to other"
87898,4,"China's stock exchanges rebounded on Monday from the sharp losses suffered over the previous two sessions, while the yuan currency and government bonds gained.'`

The reason why China is able to allow its currency to ""float"" is because they have been able to grow so much and the dollar has been so weak.
But that doesn't mean when the dollar's value increases or they stop growing it will suddenly become stable, which is why the markets are reacting to the recent moves in a negative manner.
It can be argued that if the US starts growing at a much higher rate than the rest of the world it could eventually be at a point where the US dollar begins to rise and then it wouldn't matter if they were allowed to float, because then China would be on the sidelines and could never catch up enough to change their trade policy, but you will notice they have changed it very recently due to the trade war with the US, showing us that is also a possibility.

The list of confirmed cases includes 39 patients who work or have worked at Walsall Manor Hospital: 37 have contracted the disease and two have died, health chiefs said on Sunday.
Other patients in the Walsall Manor outbreak include those from across West Midlands; Telford and Wrekin; Solihull; Coventry and Warwickshire and Birmingham.
Some 40 staff at Manor Park Hospital and two more at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham have also been diagnosed with COVID-19, health bosses confirmed on Saturday.
All 43 coronavirus cases were traced back to the two hospitals, they added.
All three hospitals run by Care UK have suspended visiting.
In a joint statement care bosses at Care UK, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham and Queen Elizabeth Hospital Wolverhampton said: ""We are working with Public Health England (PHE), NHS England and NHS Improvement to review our infection control and procedures to prevent any further spread of the infection - and we are following their advice.

This is especially worrisome from a global perspective, given that the majority of world's GDP (gross domestic product) comes from just five countries: US, EU, Japan, China, and India. The pandemic, caused by the new coronavirus, has hit not only these countries, but also many developing nations like Mexico, Argentina, and Turkey. However, the biggest losers are the developing countries, whose GDPs are expected to contract by 0.8 per cent this year. Many countries have resorted to introducing fiscal stimuli or fiscal easing that would directly fund health-care expenditures, while others have provided direct cash grants to poor citizens. However, it is the poorest of the poor, who depend on micro-credit loans from commercial banks, that would most likely be hit the hardest.

95183,3,"The Global Economy Faces a Series of Major Challenges: Economic growth has slowed markedly and is especially problematic in developing nations. Supply chain disruptions have caused inflation and higher prices of raw materials in some industries. Governments are undertaking large, but sometimes unconventional, economic support and stimulus packages to mitigate short-term impacts of these macroeconomic issues. Policy responses have varied across countries; however, many have focused on stabilizing markets and stimulating business and consumer confidence. Given the depth of the COVID-19 downturn, more expansive fiscal stimulus is likely and more monetary stimulus may be implemented. While these policies are helpful, they cannot replace fundamental structural reforms aimed at boosting productivity, reducing inequality, and modernizing labour markets. Ultimately, the economic health and well-being of the citizens of developing nations and the stability of global supply chains require improved governance and a commitment to long-term growth, which in the United States, remains the ultimate goal for our prosperity and national security.```

According to the latest IMF (International Monetary Fund) economic forecasters, the world economy is facing its worst depression since the Great Depression of the 20th Century. The international economic community is calling for large-scale policy support and unprecedented coordination to support economies. However, there is a lot of disagreement among nations on how and where to spend, given that trillions of dollars worth of aid will be necessary to help economies in the short term. A new report published by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) has analysed the potential fiscal responses and their potential to deliver sustainable growth over the long run. The report covers a large portion of the OECD and a number of emerging economies. It presents a detailed analysis of the fiscal measures under consideration and the cost of implementation, as well as possible improvements. In case there are not enough funds to go around, it discusses possible debt forgiveness. It concludes with suggestions for additional policy actions for long-run support. Given the severe deterioration of activity and the need for a massive financial boost to economies, it is imperative for the international community to act swiftly and comprehensively to avoid long-term damage"

  Article: Manchester City came from 2 goals down to beat Bayern Munich 3-2 in the Champions League Group D match at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday night. City had looked dead and buried inside the first 15 minutes as Bayern raced into a 2-0 lead. Thomas Muller opened the scoring after five minutes sliding home a low left-foot shot past City keeper Joe Hart. Seven minutes later, Mario Gotze doubled the lead capitalizing on a dithering City defense to fire home from six yards following a corner kick. But the tide started to turn against a rampant Bayern just before the half-hour mark as David Silva slid in to score after James Milner had headed the ball into the six-yard area.

Solution

The plain text should not be truncated. In general, the plain text should also have no URLs.

This can be easily done by just replacing each instance of ```with a hash and truncating that:
``` # The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges. Given the following example of an article and its summary ` The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the `combined impact of the COVID-19 **pandemic, geopolitical tension **and climate change. ` Economic growth has slowed considerably across both `developed **and developing `nations.

What do you think about this format? As a summary, it definitely allows the reader to easily see what is going on, but there seems to be far too much going on to be able to parse effectively. If we were to remove all the bullets and lists, is it still as effective?

It's not a summary, there is no conclusion. It's an overview.
A summary should be no more than a few sentences. Not many. Not longer than a couple paragraphs. As it is, you can read the text for the summary, and spend a lifetime to make sense of what they're saying.
The problem is not the text format, it's the content.

This is the first step in the process. Next, the author, typically an academic or a reporter, needs to generate a list of citations. This is based on using the same format for the citation as above or similar one. The list of references (articles or book chapters) is then converted into a bibliography, which is the next step, after that there is a citation index which contains information about authors, titles, publication dates, etc.

What was missing?

All these things sound great, but the thing that is lacking is an article that provides a clear insight into the situation and possible solutions. At least at a macro level there should be a way to break it down a bit. One idea would be to make the summary (or some of it) available in a ""full text"" version, and at least refer to other resources like Wikipedia which are more clearly defined as ""not in an expert-level publication"". There is currently no consensus about what constitutes an expert publication, but that would have to be defined somehow, or allow for the creation of consensus documents via Wikipedia.

Background
The international economy is facing several challenges due to the combination of COVID-19 (virus that causes COVID-19), global geo-political tensions, and climate change.
The pandemic has triggered widespread shutdowns and quarantines that have slowed global production and travel.
Geopolitical tensions between the US and China have escalated, with US military forces threatening military action against China's territorial claims to the South China Sea (a busy shipping route that is rich in natural resources), and China responding with a massive military buildup of its own.
And climate change is continuing to cause worsening droughts, famines, extreme weather, and economic recessions.

Impacts on international growth
The combined impact of these three factors has slowed global economic growth considerably in the first half of 2021.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates that world economic activity slowed to 2.5 percent in 2020 (in US dollar terms) compared to 3.4 percent"

34944,1,"As the world continues to grapple with the social, economic and health crises imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the disease, geopolitical tensions and climate change. Economies all over the world, particularly those that depend heavily on trade, are suffering. Developed and developing countries alike are contending with severe supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and heightened levels of unemployment as they respond to the mounting fallout. In developing countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating deep economic, health and socio-economic inequalities. Efforts by the countries affected to protect public health have had a significant impact on economic growth and increased vulnerability of the poorest and most vulnerable populations. This, coupled with geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East, North Africa and Eastern Europe, is leading to severe challenges to the stability of the international system as we have known it. With the COVID-19 crisis, the climate crisis and the looming global economic collapse all in one, it has become clear that the future of global governance will be determined by states that demonstrate the capacity to uphold global well-being above narrow national interests. Such states – those that care deeply about international peace and security and care about achieving the Sustainable Development Goals"

64112,4,"The impact of global warming and climate change is not lost on us, and neither is the threat of an existential threat. What is it? Climate change refers to an increased rate of global warming in response to the increased emission of greenhouse gases and other factors. The climate of the earth is a dynamic system, and therefore it is not possible to predict the future, but global warming is a real phenomenon. In fact, it is being caused by carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. This causes a number of changes, including higher temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, rising sea water levels and changes to the world's hydrological cycle, which may lead to drought and flooding, and a decrease of the world's food supply. How do we address the issue? There are many initiatives to tackle the issue of global warming. In 2008, 195 countries agreed on a binding climate treaty called the UNFCCC. The treaty required signatories to limit their total global emissions of greenhouse gasses in 2020. In 1992, UNFCCC set goals that member states should aim for by 2050. The current goal is to cut down global emissions at least in half since 1990 and to stabilize global temperature at no more than 2–5°C above pre-industrial levels. Although CO2 emissions decreased between 2005"

On 11 October, the United Nations's Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) said the price of key cereals had doubled in the past year, and warned that food prices were likely to rise even further. Fears that the eurozone debt crisis will flare up once again are high. In the United States, the presidential election on Tuesday 15 November risks destabilising economic markets, with pundits warning that it could swing the election in favour of either Republican candidate Mitt Romney or Democratic incumbent Barack Obama. In addition, there is a risk that Europe will be plunged into fresh turmoil if the new government in Greece fails to impose reforms to secure its debt relief in line with the terms of its bailout. Analysts from the Institute of International Finance said that they expected a Greek exit from the eurozone within two years, though there were hopes that there would be an agreement to extend terms of Greece's bailout beyond its expiry in the spring of 2014. ```

We are entering uncharted territory as we navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Although economic growth has slowed considerably, most countries around the world were already undergoing significant changes as they seek to become more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable. These positive efforts to build growth and improve economic conditions will likely be derailed by a broad range of factors. It may take until mid-2022 until global GDP approaches its pre-pandemic level.
A lack of coordinated action to slow greenhouse gas emissions and better protect lives and livelihoods may deepen already considerable inequality and increase competition for resources between different regions. There remains a lack of trust in governments and financial institutions. Global cooperation and effective leadership will be essential to limit the effects of these factors on the global economy and reduce uncertainty for all.
While COVID-19 may have slowed or stunted economic activity, it would be foolhardy to believe that our economies are permanently damaged by this event.

 Article: A new study claims the UK faces a food security crisis for the first time.
Its report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies says that food bank usage has nearly doubled in two years, and has risen by more than half since 2014.
It says that even a minor shock to the economy could leave many not eating sufficiently.
It also says that the pandemic and Brexit could cause more hunger and food poverty unless government and regulators increase food security.
But the IFS report also highlights the resilience of the UK food system to the challenges it faces.
This could include the UK being better at producing enough food, and better at preventing the loss of food and ensuring food is affordable.
However, it also suggests the government's new National Food Strategy is unlikely to do much to help.
And it says that if the government does not raise wages for low-paid workers, such as workers processing food in the food supply chain, then food security will struggle to improve.

It is possible that the conflicts will intensify and more frequent, leading to higher risks in both developing and developed economies.```

UNHCR, which is calling for better access to displacement camps, said a military offensive in the north of the country, known as Kasai Central, has forced more than 2.3 million people -- over half a million children -- to flee their homes since the beginning of 2013. The U.N.'s refugee agency said this was the highest number of new displacements since the beginning of a peace process in October last year to rekindle peace deal negotiations between the DRC government and an umbrella group of ethnic groups in the country, known as FDLR, a group that has been involved in human rights violations since the country's independence in 1960.

The US economy shrank by a record 6.8 percent in the second quarter of 2020, according to the revised figures, but is continuing to recover. The data is based on gross domestic product reports from the US Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. “The data show that the economy is continuing to recover, and we believe that the GDP will increase by 3.5 percent next year,” said Sung Won Sohn, Dean of the School of Public Policy at Hanyang University.

Answers :
 A: ""No. The world has never been more interconnected"". This is incorrect.
B: 3
C: 1

( A)
I do not agree with the above A. The global economic growth has slowed significantly during pandemic and geopolitical upheavals over the past few years.   There are a few examples ( https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/economy/10636391/Economic-growth-has-slowed-for-the-thrice-in-a-row-as-UK-trade-balance-expands-with-USA.html  ) of various countries' economy and trade status.

( B)
This is correct.

( C)
This is incorrect.

( D)
This is incorrect. According to the article, economic growth of developed nations has stagnated in recent years, while emerging nations have flourished.

 A similar study, which evaluated machine learning software for predicting gun theft, by Georgia State University and the University of Colorado at Boulder published its outcomes on November 20, with the finding of ‘substantial potential to prevent theft’."
89460,4,"Crime prevention and detection are the main objectives driving the use of crime reporting and crime intelligence systems. These systems have evolved to support more efficient investigation and decision-making, by combining data available from multiple sources across police divisions or police agencies. Police officers and agents today have too much data to sort, and too little time to review it. To make sense of what they need, they need better data tools to interpret existing information and to uncover previously undiscovered relationships between crime types, locations, suspects, and other factors. To aid decision-making, these tools are often designed to detect patterns and predict future activities of criminal suspects. But such tools alone will not be effective in enhancing criminal justice outcomes; human interventions are also required.```

This works best when written as the summary of the article above, and then copy and pasted into a blank document.

Caveats:-
* Most newspapers don't accept the summary method.

* Do not use this to write a paragraph about a topic that you want to discuss.

5808,4,"An ancient metal rod from Scandinavia that left experts perplexed for more than a century has finally been identified as a'magic wand' used by a witch to cast spells. The staff, which was found in a ninth-century grave, is curved at the end -- causing it to be misidentified as a fishing hook or a spit for roasting food. However, archaeologists say that the rod was in fact a magical item belonging to a sorceress who was 'on the margins of society.' The bent rod was removed before being buried with its owner. Perhaps the reason it was bent is to eliminate its magical properties. Perhaps its owner's family didn't want her to return from the dead.'``
For the actual. article, the article URL above contains all the details.
In the past, it is rare for a summary to use full articles rather than just the summary -  but here it makes sense. For example, there wasn't much of an article about the magic wand. So it does actually show the magic wand described in the summary to the reader. As the summary mentions the wand's origins in the ninth century, this probably explains why the article article gives more details.

The compound works on several cancer types, killing most cells in the tumour but not surrounding healthy cells. This novel strategy could be used to selectively target cancer cells while leaving normal cells untouched, leading to the development of improved radiotherapy and immunotherapy treatments. `

The warning to Theresa May's officials was contained in a secret letter sent to Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, warning that forcing companies to reveal their gender pay gap data may even lead to a ""collusion frenzy"" to hide the figures.
The letter said that the Government was still ""considering what it could do to ensure the accuracy and consistency of information disclosed"" and the ""proper balance between providing greater detail on the reasons for pay gaps and the public interest in knowing them"".
CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said that it might be possible to ensure that pay gaps were not made worse through the measures planned in the Government's action plan on gender equality.
But she warned: ""It is clearly much harder to control pay in sectors where there are many more small businesses, so it is hard to prevent any negative impact. If businesses know they could lose their entire workforce, just to be able to publish better, we could"

 Article: A UK teenager today appeared in court charged over the alleged murder of a young girl. Jordan Grant, 17, denies the murder of Milly Dowler. The 13-year-old is thought to have been abducted following a walk in 2002. Grant is also charged with two counts of perverting the course of justice. The teenager appeared at Dewsbury Magistrates' Court after having flown back from Australia, where he was arrested on suspicion of murder. It is alleged that Grant conspired to conceal the murder of a child and committed perjury at a previous hearing. He did not enter a plea and was remanded until a trial at Leeds Crown Court.

These countries are on the brink of collapse in a repeat of the Lehman crisis. Some policymakers are trying to save the situation by pushing more policies on the problem without addressing the root causes of economic fragility. This could lead to a much higher inflation rate and the subsequent impoverishment of the very people that policymakers are trying to protect at a high cost to themselves.```

The global economy has experienced slower growth and is encountering supply chain issues exacerbated by the lack of transboundary workforce and the closure of the world's borders. A shift is underway towards digitization, a process that will accelerate the technological and labor productivity revolution. The world must prepare for the future of work due to the ongoing social and economic challenges. Global economic growth slowed considerably (growth in the US has declined in each quarter of 2020 from 3.2% to 3.1%, compared to 2.5% growth in the fourth quarter of 2019) while trade also shrank significantly (8.9% in the first quarter of 2020).

The report says the virus ""is likely to leave the largest budget hole in US history"" even when financial assistance and one-time federal funds are factored in.

Now, this article is in fact a true example of writing a summary from a news article. One thing that will be important will be making sure the two descriptions are different yet related. Let's say the ""Global Economy"" is a broad statement of the situation and then the summary will be a more specific statement of the situation in light of the main article.

What we want to do is present the summary in the form of the same flow as the article so that readers see the progression from the broad summary to the more narrow summary.

Let's start by showing the reader the first paragraph from the story. The only description is ```. The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID. ```.

Remember, we are trying to do two things here. First, as we mentioned before, we want to show our readers the progression from the main paragraph to the summary paragraph. For that purpose, we need to make sure that our two descriptions are related and have different yet related information. We do this by showing each one as quoted on its own line.

 In its entirety, the quote from the article above contains a list of support measures, a list of challenges, and the phrase ```government initiatives.''  It is therefore ambiguous whether the support measures and challenges were the cause of the slower growth, the root cause of slower growth, or a symptom of the cause(s), challenges, and/or symptoms of slowdown.

In a similar problem, the article has to be the original text. That's because in one line, you can't give information in two ways.  There's some flexibility in which form the information may be presented, but it cannot be both the summary of the text and the text.

25620,3,"The global economy faces unprecedented challenges due to economic downturn, rising inflation, and geopolitical troubles. Global growth has slowed, and there are heightened risks in some countries. Government interventions are being taken to boost inflation as much as possible. The global economy is trying to recover slowly, while political crises increase in the world.```

The summary above would be of interest only to sophisticated analysts: the details of the economic situation would seem less relevant. If one wishes to be interested only in the detail one needs a separate article rather than a summary. Readers would not normally want to read only the summary: it is a bit hard work. Nor am I interested in what is going on in world politics or what other things are happening.
What I am interested in is a brief review of what is contained in the article, something like this:
```The US Economy is recovering slowly, which has been aggravated by inflationary pressures. The Federal Reserve is trying to balance the growth in the price of inflation while not going off the boil that much, keeping interest rates at their current high. These pressures have been exacerbated by fiscal stimulus on both sides of the Atlantic. The US government has boosted the size of its support for workers; its fiscal stimulus is one of the largest in history"

Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth.```"

 Article: While the world's economies are struggling to recover from the pandemic, the world's richest nations are planning to step in to help their poorer counterparts.  The U.S., The European Union and The United Kingdom announced new measures to boost foreign aid and support climate change measures. The aid will be allocated to countries in Africa and other regions where it is needed the most to overcome the impact of the pandemic.

 Article: The world's major economies will this week approve a substantial increase in borrowing to fight the pandemic and revive growth, in an attempt to overcome years of discord over the need for more multilateral global spending. A deal on a proposal to issue ""Special Drawing Rights"", the IMF's foreign-exchange reserve asset, could be presented in the Bretton Woods Agreement group of countries and the Group of 20 (G20) at an online meeting this week, said two officials in the Italian finance ministry. IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva has been pushing G20 nations to boost liquidity since last year, when the crisis upended the system of global lending.

Summary: Atletico Madrid upset European champions Inter Milan to secure the UEFA Super Cup in Monaco. Goals from Jose Reyes and Sergio Aguero handed the Europa League winners a healthy advantage before Inter's Argentina striker Diego Milito missed a late penalty. It signaled defeat for new Inter coach Rafael Benitez in his first competitive fixture, after taking over from Jose Mourinho, who joined Spanish club Real Madrid. Inter had the better of the opening half with Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder going close from a tight angle. But in the second half, Atletico posed more problems of Inter's defence and they deservedly took the lead when Reyes' shot squeezed past keeper Julio Cesar at the near post. As Inter pressed for an equalizer, Atletico doubled their advantage when Sergio Aguero turned home Simao's left wing cross. There was still time for Atletico keeper David De Gea to save Diego Milto's penalty in the final minute. Elsewhere, newly-promoted Kaiserslautern shocked German champions Bayern Munich with a 2-0 win in the Bundesliga. Two goals in as many minutes from Ivo Ilicevic and Srdjan Lakic gave the home side the advantage just after the half hour mark. Despite fielding a host"

In order to solve your problem, you must first understand the problem. By creating a list, your only way to represent the content would be to use URLs and lists. URLs are a good way to represent certain types of web content, but they are really only effective at displaying URLs.

Is this too far removed from what we are doing, if a human reads it,? Why can a computer not comprehend and understand the above? This is one of the many questions I have been asking myself.

It's called a ""summary"" for a reason - it summarizes. Most algorithms can't extract context like that.
It would be like asking an algorithm to produce a ""highlights"" article, which is pretty much what summarizers do.

Is this not a subset of what a machine learning algorithm could do? I believe that machine learning makes it possible to combine information in novel ways. There is a saying that if you can measure it then you can theoretically solve it. In this case, why cannot machine learn the context of the plain text version?

How should you write it? How do you show the reader, the user that the information is credible and that it's not just a bunch of words to trick us?

One thing to remember is most people don't read articles from top to bottom. I'm sure many people won't jump into the link. For them, the headline will be the main focus. In the examples above, the ""headlines"" were pretty terrible.

These market conditions have had severe impact on the low-income families and are exacerbating global inequalities.  ```The World Trade Organisation estimates that goods traded globally amounted to US$26.2 trillion in 2018. This included US$12.8 trillion in exports and US$11.4 trillion in imports, providing a basis for measuring economic ties and economic impacts of the global economy. However, this estimate does not cover a significant portion of trade that occurs outside official markets – for example, over a quarter of trade by volume was made through so-called ‘underground markets’.[28]  ```The growth of global trade has been slowing sharply since 2015, leading to falling trade volumes. For example, global trade growth in 2016 was slower than in both 2014 and 2015 and was the weakest since 2009. In particular, for merchandise exports and imports, trade growth in emerging markets in the year 2016 fell to just 0.1 per cent.  ```Although global trade has slowed sharply in recent years, certain countries continue to enjoy a healthy export performance.

Moreover, the recent wave of climate-induced extreme weather events, such as the California wildfires and extreme floods in the United Kingdom, have highlighted the vulnerabilities faced by the global economy. The pandemic has also exacerbated underlying economic and political vulnerabilities, including those relating to inadequate health systems and inequalities in access to health services, education, and basic necessities. Furthermore, despite fiscal support measures being put in place worldwide, economic growth in a number of nations is projected to remain sluggish for the remainder of 2020. Faced with these setbacks, the International Monetary Fund recently forecasted that the global economy would grow by 5.8 percent in 2021, compared to its earlier estimate of a growth rate of 3.2 percent. Meanwhile, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) expects global growth in 2021 to be similar to the projected 5.8 percent, with the U.S. economy expected to see the fastest growth of 9.1 percent, despite the risk of an increase of COVID-19 infections stemming from the resurgence of the virus across the United States.

44528,3,"As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, the global economy is struggling. Trade, investment and consumer demand have all slowed, and it is unclear when this challenging environment might improve. At the same time, geopolitical risks are mounting; cyberconflict and climate change continue to threaten the stability of the global economy and its supply networks; and a range of social problems exacerbated by the pandemic continue to put pressure on public finances, jobs, incomes, health outcomes and education. Governments are responding with a combination of fiscal, monetary and support measures, but the need for further and more ambitious fiscal and support measures in the short term is still large and urgent. These are exceptional times. The global economy faces unprecedented challenges - from the COVID pandemic to global geopolitical tensions - and, at a time of constrained policy space, these challenges are compounded by a need for fiscal and financial support at the scale and speed required to keep economies afloat and sustain livelihoods. Fiscal policy responses to the pandemic crisis must protect jobs and incomes and safeguard access to public goods. The fiscal response to the initial phase of the crisis must build on the lessons from this phase to ensure that public support continues to reach those most in need, while providing longer-term, more targeted responses to the economic and behavioural"

98520,3,"A global economy has stumbled. A mix of pandemic, globalization and geo-political unrest led to the greatest economic disruption in a century.
For the majority of people, this was a bad thing, with the COVID-19 pandemic forcing people to stay inside, shuttered businesses, and more than three million people dying around the world.
But for some people it meant they could continue working, or had a break from working, or perhaps went to the beach, or to a protest, or to the woods, or to a protest in the woods. Whatever their reason, many people seem a little happier, and they know they were lucky - because the economy had a chance to recover.
Some governments have used this opportunity to try out policies to help people, but most have used this opportunity to try out different policies to hurt people.
Some of those policies are going to stick around long after the pandemic is over, and maybe even long beyond.
For example, the governments that helped people the most were the ones that were really successful in stopping the pandemic, like New Zealand.
They also helped their people through it, because they were able to get everyone safely back to work, and safely back to their friends and families again, and their"

12726,1,"The global economy has slowed down considerably, largely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global supply chain. The effects of the pandemic in Europe and the U.S. are far more severe than those in emerging economies. Government policy efforts are already leading to major distortions within the global economy. Economic growth has slowed considerably on both sides of the Atlantic and is expected to fall significantly short of its previous trend rates. The global recovery will be supported in the near term by extraordinary fiscal stimulus measures. But these are being outweighed by a sharp deterioration in economic and financial conditions that is leading to a substantial rise in global risk premia. The risk of higher global inflation is also rising, which could force central banks to act faster than they otherwise would have done. On the positive side, there has also been significant progress in combating the outbreak of COVID-19 and many of the dire forecasts were clearly exaggerated early on, giving hope that economic activity will return to its original path next year.```

12726,3,"The global economy has entered a very severe economic crisis. The worst is yet to come as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will persist well beyond the year to come.
In order to minimize the extent of this crisis, governments worldwide are taking a series of measures that will have both an effect on near-term recovery, and help prepare for a far more severe downturn on the other side of the epidemic. In order to achieve this the government will need either an influx of new and additional funding, or a scaling-down of spending on current program. But given the scale of the crisis, there is little prospect of the former. Indeed, government debt is likely to rise sharply in the coming years.
This would not necessarily be a bad thing in the long-term, if the interest payments to be paid on this debt are low and sustainable in an average case (and if the government is not in a massive amount of other debt). But these conditions will not hold as governments begin to issue significant new debt. So, a good number of countries are currently considering measures that will raise the cost of servicing current bonds,"

Article: The World Bank and International Monetary Fund should step in to address the debt crisis, International Monetary Fund (IMF) member Luis Costa said Sunday.
While Costa stressed the central importance of Greek debt reforms, “I see the need to increase the debt ratio by 10 percentage points” in order to avoid the loss of credibility that would follow if Athens defaulted, he said.
The IMF has repeatedly warned that Greece’s debt is untenable and that the eurozone, as a whole, could follow its Greek example if measures aren’t undertaken swiftly.
Greece’s debt problems aren’t yet threatening the eurozone, but they are becoming more and more important.

67448,1,"A man-made crisis: How the world is facing the unprecedented challenges of the COVID pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. To cope, several governments are announcing stimulus packages, as well as reforms in the field of social protection. For their part, businesses and households need protection to keep them from financial ruin and from the risks linked to the current situation. The aim of these measures is to achieve sustainable growth, and to promote long-awaited economic and social cohesion and reduce inequality. Meanwhile, however, the economic and health crises have also greatly exacerbated the problem of social exclusion, particularly for the most vulnerable. For these reasons, the global economy will emerge from the COVID crisis at a crucial moment in its history. This, coupled with the challenges linked to growing conflict and climate change, have set the stage for the rise of populism and nationalism. The response of government policies to these profound crises, therefore, will serve as a true barometer of the power of states and the role of the private sector in societies. Given the many uncertainties surrounding the economic and health situation, what are the most likely scenarios for the coming period in the world as a whole? Can democratic governments deliver economic stimulus, protect people's health and wealth, reform welfare systems, and promote the fight"

The virus is spreading rapidly across the world, putting pressure on governments' ability to contain the spread and the health care systems' capacity to cope with the surge in cases. Oil prices and equity markets are plummeting as demand for oil weakens and concerns intensify over future supply. Confirmed cases of the virus are accelerating, reaching more than 230,000 cases worldwide by the end of March. Governments worldwide have rolled out stimulus measures to cushion the economic shock from slowing growth and lower energy prices. Oil prices recovered from their lows in late March but remain weak year over year. Inflationary pressures are rising, and"

  The above example may be used to create a summative summary. The summary is not for the purpose of assessing the accuracy of the work itself. Rather, the purpose is to help you structure the work in a way that is useful for making the final presentation. The summative summary should be organized so that it is in paragraph form, with headings. As a summary it should be short enough to read on a single page. You should always have as much of the original piece written as possible. If there are quotes, you should try to use as many quotes as possible.
The key will be to provide the most important information about the piece in the summary paragraph. If it is possible, try to provide a one sentence summary of the key idea underlying the essay along with a key thought or concept to focus on as you read it.
If the summary is too long, then you can break it up into two or more paragraphs and break up the key thought of the text into smaller thoughts or ideas. Use the bullets in the original text to help you guide yourself as you read the summary."

 Are there methods and techniques for automating these?

72251,2,"Actors, producers and directors, writers, musicians, academics and fans have been reacting to the news Disney will be producing an origin story for its hugely popular animated hero. The forthcoming 'Astro Boy' will be a live-action film for Netflix and is based on the long-running Japanese comic book superhero. The movie is set for release in 2021 and will be produced by Warner Brothers and Legendary Entertainment. 'Astro Boy' originated in 1951, when Japan was facing the aftermath of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. The young hero, Astro Boy, would go on to become a superhero, a symbol of technological progress and a symbol of the Japanese nation. The new movie will look at his formative years and will also be adapted by Osamu Tezuka's widow Chizuru on his creation. The American movie giant, however, has not revealed the plot in full. Astro Boy first appeared in Tezuka's manga in 1951 and the Japanese animation studio Studio Ghibli would go on to re-adapt the character in 2008. Astro Boy's story is so enduring that the manga has sold over 100 million copies worldwide, making it one of the world's best-selling comic books of all time. Disney's new"

Economic growth has slowed considerably across both developed and developing nations. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are exacerbating economic inequalities, making it harder for low-income families to afford basic necessities. Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth.
Despite the significant policy response and fiscal support, the global economic recovery is expected to be weak, weighed down by slow vaccine rollouts, renewed waves of infections, and the fading of fiscal support measures. On the long run, the long-term scarring of the pandemic will remain in view, with a permanent loss of growth and increased inequality expected in many countries unless additional policy support steps are taken. These challenges call into question the sustainability of the pre-pandemic economic growth model and the potential need for a fundamental reform of the global economy.
This assessment is based on a simulation of the world economy in the year 2050. It shows the extent of the challenges and policy options available. The analysis starts with a base assumption that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a transitory effect"

64988,2,"In January 2020, a large crack running more than half the width of 67P-C (Comet 67P-Churyumov–Gerasimenko) was revealed. The crack had been inching its way across the comet's surface for about 6 years, slowly growing. More cracks were discovered subsequently, and it was widely speculated that 67P-C was beginning to show signs of breakup. The crack, along with several others, were believed to provide evidence that the comet was breaking up, and that its disintegrating nucleus would be a major problem for the future of the Solar System. Scientists had also found that the comet's shape was ""fluffy"", which may have complicated breakup predictions. Comets generally don't break up, and when one does there is usually a lot of activity that precedes it and occurs over the course of many months. The activity in the case of 67P-C wasn't obvious, which led to many scientists claiming that the ice around 67P-C was too thick and prevented a breakup event. In a recent research, scientists from the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Solar System Research argued that 67P-C's surface was much more ""fluffy"" than expected. The researchers found that the ""fl"

52528,3,"In an economic collapse caused by COVID-19, climate change and political hostility, the global economy is facing unprecedented challenges. Growth has slowed considerably; supply chains have been disrupted and inflation has risen. This is having an adverse effect on low-income households, particularly regarding food. Governments are scrambling to put appropriate social welfare measures in place. But, if there is enough money for governments to do this, why are their economies struggling so much? The key cause of this economic collapse is that, in the absence of sufficient action by companies to address climate issues — such as renewable energy, clean transportation, and the transition to zero carbon, not to mention efforts to tackle excessive inequalities — the environment in which the global economy operates will deteriorate. While many companies are doing all they can to address the climate crisis, unfortunately the overall corporate response has only started to come out of the closet in the last two years. Companies are beginning to get involved in these discussions, and some may be doing just as much as governments. It appears to me that the global economy is under enormous stress and in need of support. That means that there is a need for the current and future generations and all the different parts of society — including corporates and governments — to help restore it. ```"

The answer : 1. The author gives the whole text of the example, not the summary in the summary (it must correspond). 2. It's not enough to know which of 2 is the correct summary, but the two summaries must be different (a different style may be enough).
If the two summaries are from the same context, then it's possible to check if there are any common words, phrases, etc., which would allow you to combine the two summaries (this requires some knowledge about context, so I'll leave it to a later blog post).

For example, Spain now relies on renewable energy sources for 50% of its power. However, experts have warned that the industry requires a further breakthrough in technological development to reach the point where solar panels can not only meet the increasing demand for clean energy, but also be produced economically. This has meant that many entrepreneurs have been developing new solar energy technologies. ```

The summary can be more detailed for those with enough time, but should be under 2000 words. The summary should be able to provide a general overview of the article without getting bogged down in details. A good summary can even be used to introduce the article in a class. In conclusion I want to say, there are a couple of things that make for a good summary. One, it should be able to be read in its original context and not be a one-size-fits-all sort of summary. Second, you should be able to come up with a summary that encapsulates the article.

Assignment
1. Read the following article and choose how you would approach the article."
10298,0,"The global economy is struggling due to geopolitical tensions, climate change, and COVID-19″

The article above may not sound like an interesting, yet critical news story. Why? Because its headline and summary has very little to do with the article itself. Its headline does not provide a meaningful or useful summary. It describes an economic event that may or may not actually have happened! The plain-text summary sentences provide an inaccurate description of the article and have no relation to the text.

In a similar manner, when a business is creating content it needs to decide the headline and summary to go with the main piece of text. The headline and summary of a website, newsletter, blog post, and even an e-mail marketing campaign need to be relevant to the message being conveyed and be meaningful to its intended audience.

The headlines that are chosen for a digital article tend to be:

Short.

Pertinent to the subject matter.

Clever.

Pithy.

Specific (to a particular niche, for example).

The following article titles were chosen to have a greater effect on people who visit a particular site and are likely reading the publication for the first time:

Using this example and assuming that the paragraph is a stand-alone article, the second paragraph, with its description of the problem from the point of view of the third party, may be moved to the front of the page, thereby setting up the first sentence.

The problem and/or the solution can be either listed as a list in the article summary and/or a complete solution can also be offered, together with an explanation of the rationale for this being the best way to overcome the problems it poses.
This will make it easier for the reader to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the article or work.

 Article: The Prime Minister of Israel is under house arrest. After the recent elections Israel`s Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu lost parliamentary majority and is not authorised to enter the Knesset building. Prime Minister Netanyahu is under house arrest and is unable to present any bill. He is also banned from speaking with any candidate from any party.
However, his own party and Likud members have started discussing when to hold the next elections. If Israel`s Prime Minister Netanyahu loses the Israeli election he will be unable to form a government. He will also lose the immunity which is currently granted to him under Israel`s law. He has already been charged with receiving gifts from some businessmen but so far nothing has happened. The investigation is still going on.

29019,1,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has hit the entire world. The virus originated in an area under Chinese control from where it has spread worldwide. The virus has brought countries, including India, to a standstill. Although the initial reaction to the pandemic was to contain the virus' spread by taking some drastic measures, all countries eventually decided to shut the world economy.

The economic problems caused due to the pandemic resulted in increased inequalities of wealth across societies. It exacerbated the poverty of lower class and middle-class citizens while also putting a strain on the finances of affluent governments.

Governments across the world responded to these problems by introducing various economic stimulus packages, policy reforms, and welfare packages. These initiatives were directed at stabilising the markets and helping the lower income groups gain livelihood.

Although many measures were undertaken to revive the national economies, these efforts will not solve the underlying issues. A more fundamental shift is needed in the economic paradigms. Economic growth is based on a system of exchange where resources are used to procure goods from other states. The value of these goods is transferred between countries resulting in an increase in wealth. The only problem is that resources that are used for procuring goods are generated from non"

19838,3,"The global economy faces unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, climate change, and uneven and slow progress in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Facing multiple, simultaneous crises, many poor and developing countries are experiencing slow and uneven economic recovery from COVID-19, and economic growth is likely to stay lower in 2020 than last year. Several years of slower than expected progress in fighting poverty, disease, and undernutrition are worsening the impact on human security and increasing the risk of poverty and food insecurity. Governments and the international community have responded strongly with policy reforms, fiscal measures, and support packages, but this is not enough to prevent a slow decline in economic activity. The global economy could shrink substantially in 2020, according to the latest projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), although with an improving outlook in 2021 and thereafter. The IMF now estimates economic growth at 0.9 per cent for 2020, which would be the weakest performance since the Great Depression. Inequality could rise to levels not seen since the 1930s, and if the economic recovery is slower than expected, poverty rates could jump more than expected. In the absence of a rapid rebound, the COVID-19 pandemic and climate emergencies"

So, that leaves us with the following:
1) is this a sentence?
1b) is there a verb?
2) can the noun be modified by an adverb?
3) where is this noun placed?
4) can this sentence possibly have multiple meanings?
5) does this sentence sound like a question?

My first thought was to add a word such as ``unprecedented'' to the sentence -- it sounds good, it means something and it is easy to find examples in common usage -- but I decided against it. It would have helped to define what we mean by ``problems,`` and I think an alternative would have just been ``challenges``.

Article: By. Emily Crane. A young man has admitted to setting a teenager alight in a garage and causing him such horrific burns he had to be placed in a coma. Joshua William Lomas, 21, pleaded guilty in the Adelaide Magistrates Court on Wednesday to causing serious harm to Luke Coburn, now 18,  in the garage of the teenager's home, north of Adelaide, in January 2013. Luke's mother, Cheryl Coburn, said outside court that Lomas had chosen to target Luke because he was jealous her son had started dating a girl he liked. Luke Coburn suffered third degree burns to his face, ear and arms when two attackers doused him in a flammable liquid and set him alight. 'I’m really happy that he has decided to plead guilty, he has owned what he did and it’s in his best interests to do that,' Ms Coburn told the Advertiser.

What does the HTML for that article have? In plain text it's this:
What I am asking myself is which approach is preferred when writing a news article? Or if a news article even should have a summary at all.

 How many times per hour do you have to update? I think what you are looking for is an RSS feed that pulls in the summary that you need in a matter of minutes and not per hour, right?

We've been looking into the ability to build feeds of the more popular articles on HN and are still considering the options.

Mr Goodall indicated issues involving capital spending contributed to the health board being placed in special measures.
He told the public accounts committee the spending matters were one of numerous problems that contributed to the north Wales board being put under more direct Welsh government control last week.

I can't figure out what to do. This is the same situation the BBC faced when releasing its own version of HMG's report of Lord Justice Leveson's hearings at the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics.

In a detailed summary in plain text, the BBC reports that Dr Andrew Goodall, chief executive of Betsi Cadwaladr trust in north Wales, has told lawmakers that the health board is at ""a crucial crossroads"".
As the inquiry team from the Welsh government arrives at the health board, BBC Wales understands senior managers have been informed about a possible suspension of services. This could be to do with investigations relating to financial matters, said to be connected to capital spending.
Following the statement on Tuesday, Betsi Cadwaladr chief executive Andrew Goodall has told the board meeting there are no immediate plans to suspend services.
He has accepted he needs to do more to win the trust of the politicians.

Macmillan will bring representatives from around the country to London for a meeting of the international Alliance for New Cancer Drugs (ANCD). The international panel, made up of cancer experts from 23 countries, will be asked to examine promising new cancer treatments with a view to eventually recommending a list of potential 'next generation' drugs.   Cancer medicines are currently divided into three main categories of drugs used to treat advanced cancers and save lives. These are hormone therapies, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy.   The drugs have become available'suddenly' in the past two to three years, and at a much lower cost than chemotherapy, which were traditionally the first port of call for cancer treatment. The three categories of cancer treatment were introduced in the late 1970s and scientists have been racing to find newer types of treatment ever since.

It's an intentionally nonsensical statement for two reasons.  The first is that there is little to compare, so there's no reliable reference point for comparison.

Even more exciting is the possibility that mindfulness meditation can help prevent depression in people who have symptoms of depression and in people who aren’t depressed but who want to keep their brains healthy.''

| The pandemic and related actions by governments and central banks are likely to set the stage for an unprecedented and protracted recession. We cannot rule out renewed inflation dynamics in a postpandemic world.

What should the world do?

- Implement large new stimulus programs -

The global recession of 2020/21 is unfolding amid dramatic fiscal and monetary expansionary responses led by the United States and China. While this is the right initial response, the massive, multitrillion dollar fiscal/monetary stimulus programmes will create inflationary pressures, requiring tighter fiscal policy in the medium term.

- Avoid large tax hikes -

Tax hikes should be avoided, even if governments must resort to deficit financing to finance pandemic recovery. Fiscal consolidation should be postponed and deficit spending increased during the next two years.

- Avoid sharp increases in public-sector debt -

Public-sector deficits may exceed 20% of GDP in 2020 and 2021. In the long run, debt to GDP ratios need to be kept below 60% to sustain an appropriate monetary policy framework for financial stability."

The second example :

(2) economic growth has slowed considerably across both developed and developing nations as supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are exacerbating economic inequalities, making it harder for low-income families to afford essential products.

(3) Lebanon already is on the brink of default, and in April the government passed a law to restructure $31 billion of state debt in hopes of averting catastrophic default, though foreign investors still are demanding higher compensation.
```Lebanon is likely to default on its debts in the near future as its local currency and local bonds lose ground against the U.S. dollar.

This followed several months of sluggish global activity as consumers and businesses grappled with repeated lockdowns to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and its accompanying economic fallout.

Labour's election manifesto in 1997 was the first party to define the net zero carbon economy alongside a programme for major new investment in the economy, health and education, as well as on infrastructure. The New Labour government achieved this through policy announcements, including the introduction of a new Climate Change Act and the creation of a Department for Environmental Affairs and Climate Change (now DEFRA).
In contrast to the Conservative-led coalition, Labour developed a programme of new policies that not only brought in a range of changes to improve people's jobs, incomes and skills, but also delivered on the net zero ambition including the phasing out of incandescent lightbulbs, the ban on gas boilers and more. The New Labour government also made major investments in public services, infrastructure and the NHS.
But during the last parliament, when the Tories were in a minority and dependent on the Independent Group of MPs (TIG, later reestablished as Change UK), Labour was not given its fair chance to develop this ambitious agenda.

With many species threatened with extinction, some experts question the value of continued globalization as it affects the ability of nations to ensure a balance of power, and maintain their cultures, languages, political systems, economics and natural resources.  The globalization process has also brought the world at large into an unprecedented sense of global consciousness, resulting in a concern for global issues ranging from the quality of education to the rights of immigrants. While many in the world today have become more aware of and concerned about world issues, they are also more concerned than ever before about maintaining a sense of identity, and maintaining the cultures and languages of their various countries while living in the world's most connected nation.  It is clear that the globalization process is creating unprecedented problems.  At present, the international community appears unable to control such problems, and the process is causing global and regional strife.```

70427,1,"As a result of growing uncertainty over Brexit and international trade tensions, the global growth outlook deteriorated further in May 2020. Despite policy measures worldwide to counter the effects of the pandemic and ongoing fiscal stimulus, the IMF expected global activity to decline -5.2% in 2020 and -4.9% in 2021, compared to its April forecast of -4.9% and -5.2% respectively. The US recession had been larger and longer-lasting than expected, with GDP falling 10% in the second quarter, compared to the 4% dip in the March estimate. Although employment had been stabilising, it remained 14.8 million below the February 2020 level, and the US unemployment rate had averaged 8.4% over the year to June, the highest level since the 1930s.

Despite the pandemic, 2020 was forecast to be the third consecutive year of subdued economic growth in the developed world with the exception of China. The pandemic's impact would be most pronounced in advanced economies, where weak aggregate demand was expected to continue until 2022, with the eurozone experiencing the largest decline in output. As the pandemic affected more parts of the world, lower-income countries faced greater financing needs that might lead to increased external debt distress at an increasing pace."

87731,3,"Global warming could slash the global economic growth we expect by up to half, new research has found. A study by Oxford University economists found that temperatures of between 1.5C and 2C - above the 2C level scientists say will cap global warming - could trigger a 0.6-0.8 per cent annual loss of global GDP by 2050. To put that into context, the world could miss out on $2.8 trillion (£2.1 trillion) if the world's leaders fail to agree a climate deal in Japan next year. The world should be planning for less global growth, the researchers said. Instead of a 3.5 per cent annual growth rate that they had expected under a business-as-usual scenario, world GDP could be between two and two-and-a-half per cent. The study also found the damage done to global economies by the climate change that is happening at the moment is currently worth 1% of global GDP a year. `The results are pretty frightening and give us a wake-up call that economic growth needs to be thought about much more carefully,' said Dr Christopher Dembik, of the Potsdam institute for climate impact research and part of the research team. `What we've been doing is ignoring the climate"

3850,3,"Summary

The global economy faces unprecedented challenges from the combined impact of COVID-19, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. Economic growth has slowed considerably across both developed and developing nations (see International Monetary Fund [IMF] Global economic prospects, April 2021). The pandemic is expected to reduce global GDP by a total of 4.4% this year (IMF, 2021), or equivalent to nearly $4.5 trillion. This is the worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Climate change is intensifying natural disasters, with the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season breaking the previous record by racking up 27 named storms (Climate Week, Aug. 9, 2021). These weather threats will exacerbate the risks faced across the world, particularly in developing countries, where poverty will increase and economic opportunities fall most heavily. The global community must come together to overcome these challenges, but it is clear that governments alone are not sufficient. Policy measures taken by the United States and global institutions have increased the ability to contain the COVID-19 crisis and strengthen safety nets for those affected. But much more effort is needed—particularly to mobilize private capital and create public-private mechanisms to support pandemic preparedness and climate resilience, and to help alleviate poverty.

`article` A published report that contains original or collected information that is written and published as a single piece, or which may contain several parts if the author wishes it to be so, on a given topic. It is typically published in a periodical or journal, or in other similar publications.
`text` A written material in whole or part that is not written by the author of the body of the newspaper or other publication containing it.

But now it is threatened by a triple assault: a deadly virus, mounting geopolitical tensions and global warming. Global output was already forecast to slip short of the UN’s long- term goal to boost it to $US66·84 ($90·40) a person by 2030 through faster growth and greater prosperity. And now the UN’s economics organisation warned yesterday that it would not be far off if global growth is held at 2·5 per cent this year and next, as projected now. The gloomy findings from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development highlight the daunting task of rebuilding after the pandemic slams the global economy – at a time when relations between the world’s great powers are at their worst since the cold war. The report by the aid agency, the OECD and the International Monetary Fund warned that the world risked falling short of meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for ending poverty and improving prosperity by 2030.

Manager Arsene Wenger's contract ends at the end of the season.
The Frenchman says he will continue as Arsenal manager ""unless it becomes absolutely unbearable"".
Wenger admits he has ""no idea"" about what will happen in the summer when his successor is chosen.
Wenger, who won the Premier League title during his 21 years managing Arsenal, said: ""I love football. I want to make sure it stays great for everybody.
""If your job becomes miserable, you can cope with any pressure but is it a good job? Are you fulfilling your dream?
""I came to England to become a manager not to have to live in London - but that is something I think I can live with now.""
The club's chief executive Ivan Gazidis, who was speaking on the eve of Sunday's trip to Manchester City, also said he is ""extremely confident"" at the outlook.
When asked if he was concerned about a fan backlash after a poor start to the season, he said: ""No, I am very, very confident around what we are building.
What is needed is patience. I can honestly say it is not a concern for me at all around that.""

Manchester United and Chelsea are eyeing up a move for Roma left-back Antonio Liberto, according to reports in the Italian press.
The 21-year-old only joined the Serie A side in January and has been touted for a move away after making 11 appearances this season.
Roma are keen to offload the full-back who has only arrived in the Italian capital in January having previously represented Udinese before that.
Manchester United, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid have all been linked with a move for the defender, who could cost around 15 million euros.
Liberto's agent told Repubblica: ""Some sides have been in touch. There are no serious offers yet. Manchester United? I don't want to speak about that.""
Meanwhile, Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has spoken about potential moves for two of Roma's stars.
The 20-times champion recently acquired the services of Brazilian midfielder Paulinho and Liberto's Roma teammate Miralem Pjanic, as well as defender John Terry.
The 27-year-old is still expected to move to Rome despite his manager's recent comments.
Pjanic said: ""I haven't heard anything yet,"

 Conclusion - Use the above conclusion-clues in the articles.  What are the most important issues confronting policymakers and the global economy today? What do policy measures aim to address these issues?  What is the policy response by governments?
	If the article has a policy section, it  may also be appropriate to ask a question about the policy section.  However, the best way to address these issues is to write a question about them and explain your answer.

 If there are issues such as, trade deficit (exporting more than importing), GDP (what is GDP?), inflation versus low unemployment, tax cuts, stimulus spending (and the federal government's stimulus package), what is the current and projected path of monetary and fiscal policy?   What are the global macro-economic trends"

40834,1,"The world's leading economic indicators show the global economy facing an unprecedented set of challenges as the coronavirus pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change weigh on growth prospects.
This is despite an unprecedented level of monetary and fiscal stimulus to mitigate the impact of the crisis.
According to Fitch Solutions Macro Research, the world's governments have committed or announced more than $18 trillion in support for the pandemic at global, country, and corporate levels - equivalent to around 12 per cent of global GDP.
The UK has been one of the largest economies to provide stimulus, with the economy expected to contract by 10.6 per cent in 2020.
At the country level, the UK will experience its worst year for GDP growth since 1709, according to Fitch, and will be more than one third smaller than it was at the turn of the century.
It estimates the UK government's spending will reach 5.3 per cent of GDP in 2020 - above the average of the G7.
On the other side of the debate, a range of international reports suggest that the scale of coronavirus response should mitigate the extent of global shock and that the growth outlook is improving as vaccination programmes start to take effect.

In most cases, the number of articles included in the article is larger than the number of plain-text versions of the article.  In addition, most summaries are generated from full text, which means that they include the original URL and the original version of the text.  When search engines index and retrieve articles, they cannot tell when they are using the original version of the text.

This is an analogy and not the real article. 

Good point. I would not read the article on the page.

It may be wrong to use an analogy without linking to the real article. The use of the analogy is fair, but it doesn't link back to the original article and it's unfair to use an analogy to the original article without linking back to the original article

You should read it - maybe with the dictionary - and try to answer two simple questions.

First, how does the sentence in the original format make sense?

Second, are all four parts of the sentence clearly grammatical?

My guess is the first one is harder to answer; the sentence is about the global economy and how it faces unprecedented challenges as a result of three specific challenges (pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change), and yet somehow it only reports on one specific of these three (pandemic).

The second question, however, is far easier to answer, because the summary"

The global economy is also facing increased uncertainty as the UK withdrawal from the EU becomes a reality.

The effects of all of these are likely to continue having a big effect on the trajectory of the world’s economic growth rates over the coming years as the pandemic continues to spread and governments around the world are forced to implement increasingly severe restrictions/sanctions to rein the spread of the virus, which in turn have a negative impact on the economic activities required to curb the pandemic.

These challenges come on top of the effects of extreme weather (storms, floods, and droughts) that have already been experienced over the past few years, leading to record losses to agricultural production and other economic activity. As the world economy faces increasingly large threats to its stability, economic growth is likely to continue to be very slow over the coming years as the economy increasingly turns to protecting itself from the impact of these economic and other threats.

Is this sentence syntactically correct?

Your syntax seems good to me. The only way to be 100% sure is using syntax highlighting of your code and to use a ""real"" parser. But, by far the most widely used tools are Syntastic or Pylint. 
You might also consider looking into some of the more advanced features on Syntastic (or Pylint) and see if they allow you to fine-tune the grammar of your article.

 Example of an abstract with summary  and  links:  The global economy is suffering from multiple disruptions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. Growth is lower than it has been in many years, and inflationary pressures are rising. All these issues will probably worsen without immediate and decisive global policy-making responses, and the World Bank’s latest Doing Business Report shows how the consequences can affect every corner of the world, even the most remote areas. Countries in Africa are particularly vulnerable to these and other pressures. Economic inequalities are growing in Africa, and governments all over the continent are implementing countercyclical fiscal policy as well as monetary, exchange rate, and credit measures to support low income families and prevent economic contraction.

Jamshed Javeed, 30, from the northern English city of Manchester pleaded guilty to two terrorism charges at Woolwich Crown Court. Police said the father of one had helped four associates travel to Syria for terrorism purposes last year and had planned to join them in Syria.

""He bought equipment for himself and for ISIS fighters to use once he arrived in Syria,"" Greater Manchester Police said in a statement.

Javeed's family had grown suspicious of his behavior and confronted him in December, urging him not to go to Syria, but he had said he was committed, police said.

Counterterrorism officers arrested Javeed at his home December 21, two days after the confrontation.

""Javeed was an otherwise law-abiding man who had a responsible job, a child and another one on the way,"" Detective Chief Superintendent Tony Mole said.

As part of the effort, the World Food Program will also increase the number of ready-to-eat, nutritious meals for children in quarantine or undergoing treatment and care in Ebola treatment centres.
Currently, the World Food Program is providing food daily to 1.5 million people in Sierra Leone and Guinea. Additional ready-to-eat meals will be provided to children with weak immune systems at Ebola treatment centres in both countries.

Gross domestic product growth has slowed from 2.5% in 2019 to 2-3% in 2020. Growth in industrial commodities, energy, and construction sectors slowed as demand for transportation halted and demand for industrial inputs slowed due to supply chain disruptions. Supply chain disruptions led to price increases in key raw materials like petroleum and copper (referred to as commodity prices), and the increase in commodity prices led to some manufacturing firms reducing production and investment, leading to further layoffs of workers. In addition, supply chain disruptions caused shortages in essential items, such as PPE and cleaning supplies, as demand for various commodities grew concurrently. Demand for some commodities declined as consumers scaled back on the purchase of nonessentials. Although consumer spending increased as household income increased"

The pandemic is causing an economic slowdown, rising debt, rising hunger, rising inequality and putting tremendous pressure on the environment. The consequences of this will be felt for the rest of this decade and beyond. Our task is clear: to support people and countries in a comprehensive and coordinated manner. This means continuing and even accelerating investments and reforms. To maintain our development gains, we must sustain and strengthen market economies and ensure private capital is mobilised, especially in developing countries. This requires an ambitious 2030 agenda for sustainable development, including new financing and the necessary follow-up. Furthermore, we must also put people - their rights and aspirations - at the centre of our policies. By doing so, we can build resilience against these crises as well as the systemic risks they pose. ```

Summary (from the publisher's description) : ``Business as Usual is a manifesto of five principles for business leaders: that people are our most precious resource, that the purpose of business is to create a society of well-being and abundance, that business leadership is a responsibility, that the world will benefit from more entrepreneurial firms, and that firms must be transformed by their interactions with and impact on society.```

The author and writer of this book is Peter Senge. He has created a set of core strategies and strategies that are applicable at all levels of management. As he points out in this book, people management is a core strategy, as it is a fundamental element to creating an environment of positive feedback. He also talks about the principles of leadership that he developed that can be applied in any and every organization. I would recommend this book to most executives who are looking for the fundamentals of business and leadership.

Charges are expected in Deng's death, Monroe County District Attorney E. David Christine said in December. More than 30 members of Pi Delta Psi were conducting a ritual outdoors for new pledges called the ""glass ceiling,"" according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by CNN. The objective was for Deng, who was blindfolded and wearing a backpack filled with a 20-pound bag of sand, to navigate toward someone who was calling for him ""while other fraternity brothers physically prevent that from happening,"" witnesses said, according to the affidavit. Deng fell backward, struck his head and was unconscious and unresponsive immediately after he fell,"

The move is part of a plan by the council and the local community to rejuvenate the Bridge of Don area, with plans for a £27 million riverside sports complex, new shops and leisure amenities.
The new St Andrew's Bridge Primary will serve children from age four to seven, taking in the existing Wardieburn primary and the new Bridge of Don Primary, also opening in September 2021.''

Jody McDowall, from Lerwick, told colleagues online that she intended to visit them at their homes and offices and leave them ""traumatised, frightened and emotionally scarred"" and caused them to get fired or suffer ill-health.
The supermarket had been the subject of threats and abuse from customers for its decision to end a partnership with a Lerwick takeaway, which sold halal food, after the owner launched a legal challenge over its non-halal options.
The court heard that the supermarket in question, Sainburys in Lerwick, had also been the subject of a protest march in which around 30 people dressed up as clowns in an attempt to disrupt operations.
McDowall carried out the online abuse in the name of the Muslim Association of Britain and made her threats to members of staff using the email address muslimsunited@ukonline.co.uk.''

Summary: The global economy was already facing unprecedented challenges before the COVID-19 pandemic took hold.
This is an extraordinary time. Economists project an unprecedented hit to economic growth of up to 4% from the COVID-19 shock alone. Global unemployment also is increasing rapidly, up to a potential 27 million jobs per month.
This will exacerbate income and wealth inequality and threaten a broader wave of poverty.  Meanwhile, the risk of renewed financial crisis persists and climate change is exacerbating the risks we face.  In this environment, our global policy response must be focused on safeguarding the most vulnerable and securing sustainable and inclusive growth prospects for all citizens.
To tackle the challenges ahead, we must focus on a more ambitious transition to a lower-carbon and more inclusive future, while supporting economic recovery for all.
And we must address corruption and ethics in global sport and society, and we need to be resolute in the fight against doping and match-fixing.
These issues must be on the table at the next FIFA Congress.  But while"

At the very moment when the global economy was already teetering on a precipice, geopolitical tensions flared and a Climate Change related event had to happen to put the brakes on this global economic momentum. The pandemic has shown the world that the World should come together for the greater good and not remain self centered.

We started the week by speaking to Craig Glenday, editor-in-chief of the Guinness Book of World Records. He told CNN's Becky Anderson that the two countries have a rivalry of sorts when it comes to world records. It seems that every time a German sets a record, an Indian will smash it. For instance, the largest pen ever made, a record held by a German, was beaten within a year by an Indian. ""Himanshu"" pointed out a linguistic connection between the two.

At this point I'm wondering how this situation will turn out - how will we survive from day to day?

All of a sudden they have to cancel orders and have no new stock, and people are now scared to even leave their homes because of the virus. But, fashion is not only about producing something and wearing it - it's about so much more than that so we think that a lot can be done to mitigate the effects of this crisis."

I think it's really difficult to tell if it's more or less likely. In the latter sentence you have some additional information about the reasons for the problem (and it would be a huge stretch to say the pandemic is not one of the reasons that economies are struggling), but this also changes the tone of the sentence, and makes sense to me - and yet, people memorise long, boring summaries like this all the time. You'd also expect the latter to better reflect the intent of the article to the reader. It seems the latter is true, but at least it's not something that's definitively known.
The fact that the first sentence has only two words might actually help its memorisation: it's easy for the eye to scan to the first word when reading the sentence in one go, and it has a relatively small number of (simple) letters"

Despite the criticisms, it has contributed to increasing material prosperity, and the growth of global trade and foreign investment has been an important factor powering global economic growth, and, most recently, in propping up world financial markets. Globalization has increased the scope for the transfer of know-how, has reduced the transaction costs of doing business internationally, and has reduced the cost of doing business with foreign customers and suppliers. Unfortunately, this success has made today’s policymakers a victim of their own success. ```

In the above example it is easy to see how people have used the power of Google to do search to gather information about some product in the product summary (the paragraph) but it also has been used by the user in order to make a search query and find out more information about the product, the problem with that is that, most often most of the information is irrelevant to the user and is just a duplicate of what’s already available (the main text and the summary).

 In this context, the problem I see is that the summary only says ""The global economy "", and even the body provides no information what ""The global economy"" referred to.
I.e. the body says ""The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact"", while the summary only talks about the combined impact.
What if the combined impact is a huge economic boom? What then?
Should I just use the two above sentences and make a summary where both are in full detail?

Summary: The global economy is struggling due to COVID19, geopolitical tensions, and climate change, leading to slower growth, supply chain issues, and increased inequality. Governments are countering these challenges with various support measures. ""The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said economist Paul Johnson, senior fellow at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. ``We've never had to do the sort of thing we will have to do with the coronavirus crisis. We're going to have a slump and then a long recovery that will lead to a longer recession than most countries in the world have faced.'' As a result of the crisis, the International Labour Organization predicted that the economy would ""drop by over three percent in the first half of the year alone, the first recession resulting from the coronavirus pandemic in living memory.''

The Polish tennis star, who is the world number four, was pictured nude sitting in a plastic deckchair next to a swimming pool that had been filled with tennis balls in the shoot for a special 'Body Issue'. She posed side-on showing off her modesty by carefully placing her arms. A spokesperson for the group, Krucjata Mlodych (Youth Crusade) said: 'We are shocked, saddened, and outraged by the images, which are not only immoral but also a slap in the face of our religious believers.

The heartbroken mum, from Blackpool, has spoken to the Blackpool Gazette and said she's been overwhelmed by messages of support and is determined to stop the attacks on an online memorial. Speaking for the first time following her efforts to have child abuse images including indecent images of under-16s removed from the Blackpool memorial page, Karen Downes, 48, said: 'That is why I took such immediate action to contact Lancashire Police and remove the content on the memorial page.'

Economic growth has slowed considerably across both developed and developing nations, as supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures exacerbate economic inequalities. These new shocks are significantly more difficult for fragile economies to adapt to than previous crises, which means that these economies may face prolonged, deep and unpredictable recessions. A number of advanced economies have embarked on aggressive fiscal stimulus measures – ranging from tax cuts to increased public investment – with some countries also introducing large-scale programs to stimulate domestic consumption. Many other countries, however, have already begun to implement fiscal cuts, despite clear indications that such measures would prove counterproductive. While these measures are needed to avoid a sharp increase in public debt levels which would increase the risk of bankruptcy in several advanced economies, they threaten to further weigh on economic growth. In the face of this new double-tragedy, many rich and developing countries are increasing public investment, including in infrastructure. However, this is not consistent with the principle of public investment being used to fund productivity-enhancing reforms, which in turn will boost growth and productivity. With growth still weak, many poor countries are facing sharp fiscal gaps that are preventing them from making the necessary investments"

  The full text, up to 1500 words, does exactly what it says, so it should be good enough. You can't cut it to 1000 words or less, but it's okay.

And how does it compare to a more traditional one-paragraph description?

A traditional one-paragraph description is usually one paragraph long, with the summary being placed above the paragraph.

A traditional one-paragraph description will have a title for that paragraph with a short description to attract the reader's eye and interest for a split second, while the summary paragraph is usually the first paragraph of the article and the most important one. It has two or more short sentences describing the basic topic of the paragraph in bullet point form, and the first paragraph usually also contains a list or two of main topics contained in the paragraph. While a traditional summary is usually one line long (or two lines if two paragraphs are merged), it may also be up to three lines."

As many as 11 million employees of small businesses in the U.S. face paying more for health insurance under Obamacare, according to a new report into the controversial healthcare bill. The estimate, provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services (CMS), part of the Department of Health and Human Services, also projected that 6 million others face lower rates for health insurance. The report says that this is due to the to the laws requirement that premiums for health insurance can no longer be based on an insurance applicant's age. This means that while older people's premiums are going down, younger people's are going to rise. While the estimate is far from certain, because many small businesses renewed their insurance policies in 2013. Because they renewed before 2014, they were allowed to avoid higher premiums that went into effect, when insurance coverage was required to conform to the new law, on January 1. The estimate is also affected by the report only looking at three specific provisions of the Affordable Care Act.

The decline in trade was also caused by an unprecedented rise in trade barriers and government-imposed lockdowns.

13368,1,"In this paper we provide a new probabilistic method to characterize the risks of disasters which is based on the Bayesian posterior model of uncertainty, instead of a prior model of uncertainty. We define an exponential log-likelihood function that is a special function of the prior model and use this function in the posterior model. In the posterior model we represent the degree of uncertainty in a parameter of choice as log-normal distributions. We then define the relative risks of different disasters by taking their log-likelihood function. For the first time we show that the log-likelihood function has the probability density that can be obtained from the conditional posterior probabilities of the individual disasters, but still has the shape of a normal distribution. This leads to our main result. We show that the log-likelihood function is identical to the density of the joint density, the conditional probability density, of all risk-relevant terms of the prior distribution. Because the Bayesian joint density has non-constant density, we obtain new probabilities. We use these new probabilities to formulate new relative risks of different types of natural disasters. Using these relative risks, we show that global warming (i.e. the increasing influence of climatic variables on the distribution of natural disasters) may become more important for relative"

How will our world work tomorrow? If you are worried about global changes, you are not alone. The global pandemic has left very few of us immune to its devastating effects. As the COVID-19 situation unfolds and businesses reopen, the future of our businesses and lives will be forever changed.

Reality is we now live in the period of the first big battle of the second global war. World at War, 1941 - 1945.
The global economy is an enormous system so the impact of both COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions on national, regional and world economic growth and trade are huge. And the economic impact on the global south is likely to be much greater since the global economy is much more developed there and the poverty impact is likely to be much more severe.

Although some countries have been able to overcome and even overcome the impact of the pandemic, the long-range implications of the virus and the measures taken to combat it are making it difficult to predict how the global economy will fare over the remaining months of 2020, and possibly even in 2021. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions are on the rise due to ongoing and sometimes rising conflicts in various regions of the world as well as increasing concerns over the environment. In addition, climate change continues to have major impacts, with numerous scientists urging governments worldwide to take prompt action in order to avoid catastrophic global warming. Therefore, the global economy is facing unprecedented challenges while at the same time facing the prospect of a significant slowdown in 2021, unless the world successfully manages to contain and overcome the outbreak of the virus and the other factors mentioned earlier. Governments, institutions, and businesses will need to take action in order to help the global economy overcome the challenging challenges ahead.

As a result of the pandemic, business failures have increased, stockmarkets have plunged and unemployment has skyrocketed. There is therefore a need for more flexible employment. Some of the temporary job-creation measures put in place by governments may need to be extended over time and be adapted further. One particular job-creation measure that is not yet fully realized in Germany is the creation of short-time work („ Kurzarbeit “). There is a great potential for this measure to support the preservation of jobs and the provision of temporary employment. Furthermore, it can help to preserve the welfare system by preventing a significant reduction in benefits at a stage when the government assistance may still be necessary.

Even there, though, the decline was not as bad as that of the Euro area's (down 7.7%), as well as of Japan's, China's and India's. The IMF expects that advanced economy's economies to grow by 5.6% in 2022. These economies are expected to rebound because, unlike emerging markets, they have room to relax monetary and fiscal policies.

In emerging economies where there is less room for policy actions, the contraction has been sharper. Most of these economies are dependent on exports and, with no demand on global trade, their currencies are under pressure. China's currency, the renminbi (RMB) for example, depreciated by 7.8%"

The pandemic has disrupted supply chains and led to shortages of basic necessities. Governments worldwide have sought to mitigate the crisis by injecting unprecedented levels of fiscal stimulus into their economies, through monetary and other measures. On the climate front, countries are struggling to hit net-zero emissions targets by 2050. However, with major powers yet to fully commit to climate action, key gaps remain.```

In an online course I am creating for my students, it is required that the article and the summary contain their own unique points. I was wondering if it is okay to do a small number of points from the summary using the points from the article where it directly relates to the key words. If possible, I would like the body of the summary to directly tie it back to the key word, such as using the same key word.

I've seen this technique in other sources before, but I was wondering where it originated, as it sure is a lot more common than it should be.

I don't want to start getting into a battle with a course proctor, especially with a good reason like this

 I feel this shows the bias in the BBC coverage.

Bias in reporting is a problem for everyone. They are human beings like the rest of us, which means that even if _they_ weren't bias, their reports might be biased. That isn't a flaw of the BBC, but of news in general.
If you want ""fair"" reporting, you have to use your gut and check up on articles from multiple sources.

The BBC really is great at what they have been doing for many decades in TV, radio and other media. I guess that as time has gone on, people have come to expect the same in print media as well.
This is one of the reasons that I'm hoping to read some other comments to see if the BBC's style is truly as bias as I'm thinking it is. The BBC, the Associated Press and other news sources I normally read are the first thing I grab when I'm trying to figure out what's worth reporting.

A summary of an article is a paragraph or phrase of the article, or of a summary of the article, that gives a quick summary of the key points of the article.

Financial markets around the world continue to experience volatility, as uncertainty remains high. Governments worldwide are reacting with a range of fiscal and monetary support measures to curb the pandemic's impact. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the trend toward decentralization, which raises the need for greater dialogue and cooperation on international trade and security matters. Climate change poses major challenges to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Countries are responding by adopting strategies focused on mitigating climate change and promoting resilient economies. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions are increasing.

The following summarizes articles/topics.

Tanzania president John Magufuli has been ill for more than a month, but has given no details on his condition or whereabouts.
Magufuli, whose country has seen a surge in coronavirus cases, left the election campaign trail at the end of March.
He is due to step down in November after two five-year terms in office.
Magufuli is a devout Catholic. He often makes comments on issues related to faith, like the COVID-19 pandemic.
Since taking office in 2015, he has made it easier for church-operated schools to expand and been critical of homosexuality. He also introduced the death penalty for drug trafficking, in what Amnesty International has called inhumane.
President Magufuli's name has been trending on Twitter for the past two days with many Tanzanians offering prayers and wishing him a swift recovery with others saying they can’t believe he's been ill or simply wished God to take the president away.

""The global economy is struggling due to COVID-19, geopolitical tensions, and climate change, leading to slower growth, supply chain issues, and increased inequality. Governments are countering these challenges with various support measures. Many developing countries do not have the fiscal resources or tools at their disposal. However, it is clear that this crisis is not an opportunity for self-seeking leaders and their ilk to exploit as a political or economic advantage; the international community must do all it can to provide support to those most in need.""

 Summary: The global economy is in crisis – the latest figures show the world is in the grips of its “biggest recession of our lives”. According to a survey by Lloyds TSB there are now 5.5m job losses globally since March as a result of the pandemic that has affected the UK as well as the US. Unemployment is at 2.5% but is rising as the pandemic intensifies, with the Bank of England warning that the country’s unemployment rate could rise to 16% as much as half of Britain’s retail, hospitality and leisure businesses close their doors until the end of May. A quarter of British businesses plan to cut jobs as the shutdown continues, with the retail sector losing 2.5 million jobs. Experts predict the economy could shrink by up to 14% in the second quarter while the budget deficit is expected to soar to around 18%.

Title: The Global Economy is  facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. Economic growth has slowed considerably across both developed and developing nations. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are exacerbating economic inequalities, making it harder for poor-income families to manage. Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth. Due to its central role in global trade, the global economy is heavily dependent on China as a manufacturing hub supplying large parts of the world. Even though it has reported the lowest number of COVID-19 infections, and is gradually reopening industrial sectors, the global economy is also hit by other factors such as the global oil crisis and the escalating geopolitical conflict between the U.S. and China. Given its major role in the global economy, the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to create an unprecedented recession affecting the livelihoods of poor urban workers in China, developing nations as well as rich nations like the U.S., the U.K. and France. As a result of the pandemic, the global economy"

54076,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated geopolitical tensions, forcing many nations to reconsider national priorities and adjust geopolitical tensions. The pandemic is slowing global economic growth and adding to inflationary pressures, leading governments to consider ways to stimulate growth but remain sensitive to inflation. Many countries are easing lockdown restrictions to kick-start economic activity, but the risk-reward calculus of these decisions has come under scrutiny against the backdrop of rising cases.

The most recent pandemic of COVID-19, an infectious respiratory illness that originated in Wuhan, China has been labeled the worst global health crisis since Spanish flu that erupted more than a century ago. The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed the worldwide lives of more than half a million (over 568,000) and more than 4 million are infected by now with the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University that follows the coronavirus crisis around the clock. The US, Brazil, India, Russia, and Great Britain are the biggest countries with the biggest number of infected and deceased people.

The economic devastation by the virus has been of a colossal scale. Unemployment in the US rose from 3.5% in February to 4.4%- 5% in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics."

 To make all of these summaries and summaries of summaries, you'd need a human brain; and that still leaves two more ""humans"" that need to be accounted for.

  One human would read the article and summarize the article into its plain-text summary sentence; the second summation would be made by the second human.

  The computer that reads the article is much faster and more accurate than a human, but still needs to be checked and double checked, and still makes mistakes that a human does not.

  If we assume that the computer makes no mistakes (which is clearly unrealistic), then the two humans must check the summation of the first human and check that they correctly checked the summation of the first human, and then check the summation of their second human to check that they are correct, and so on, and so on -- forever.

Answer 2

In 2 and 3, the phrase ``...supply chain disruptions...'' is modifying the phrase ``...aggravating economic inequalities.'' However, the modal verb ``to intensify...'' is intransitive, so it can't be followed by ``inhibiting'' with ``reducing'' (``to intensify inequality'').  It"

This kind of thing has driven people to do the exact same for years. It's easy to spot and flag, but there's been no way around.

Can you provide an example? Would be interesting to see.

You know, at a time when the US is actually spending less than it did even ten years ago, it’s pretty shameful to see our politicians bickering about a handful of cents for a billion dollars. Why can’t we have an honest national discussion about tax cuts and spending cuts? Let’s get real, Americans, and figure out how to actually solve some of the real problems we face.

You can pay off any debt from the last decade in two years. You're right we should solve the real problems, but this idea that we can't pay to upgrade infrastructure is bogus.

In plain text the first thing you see first thing in the article.
This looks really different and is very eye catching, especially to people who wouldn't normally read the articles. It is also a lot harder to guess what the summary is - you have no idea what to expect. If the summary seems negative it might be a good story. If the summary looks positive it is probably a negative story. You can't guess whether you're going to be given a positive or negative snippet to sum up an article.
To have the summary appear at the end of the article we don't need it to be too long, just be able to hold the attention of reader a little before giving the summary.

Federal Prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita filed a 61-page report essentially endorsing what prosecutor Alberto Nisman claimed before he died in January: that evidence shows Fernandez and other top officials tried to cover up Iran's alleged involvement in the bombing that killed 85 people at a Jewish center in Buenos Aires. Pollicita sent his report to a judge, who is expected to examine it next week after he returns from vacation.

The legal system still functions as it has done for centuries; courts are largely unchanged and still follow long-established rules. There are no apps for accessing evidence to use at trial and there are no online forms or digital documents that can be used to file a case.  It is this lack of digitalisation that has resulted in the Criminal Justice system to remain virtually unchanged for many years. There is also no evidence that the legal system would be easier to use and efficient if it were more digitalised. ```

""Playing for the money, why would you do that? Why would you want to play for money?"" the 24-year-old Swede had asked her caddie, when asked if she would take part if the prize were $1,000. But as in 2019, Hedwall was guaranteed to make the winning four on her home turf. A month earlier, she had become the only woman to enter all five of the women's team events on the LPGA Tour, when she won the CME Group Tour Championship in Naples, Florida. It was a feat rarely accomplished. ""It definitely means an end after nine years. It's going to be hard to top this year,"" she said, after claiming the $1 million bonus, a huge achievement for any woman golfer, let alone in her rookie year. She had, however won almost $15 million in LPGA earnings in her career, and it's not surprising that she'd accept the opportunity rather than pass it up. ```"

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments and health systems to devote unprecedented resources to fighting the disease and mitigating its impact, leading to slower than expected growth and increased vulnerabilities. Political and economic uncertainties also remain, including geopolitical tensions and climate change.

Growth of global trade in the first half of 2020 was the slowest since the global financial crisis a decade ago and was hampered by disruptions in global supply chains stemming from COVID-19, which in turn were likely to depress economic activity for years to come. However, global economic recovery could be aided by aggressive fiscal stimulus in many major countries, notably the United States.

The COVID-19 pandemic poses risks to the stability of food supply chains and prices, potentially fueling inflationary pressures. This trend"

It is an issue on which world leaders must agree to tackle at the November Cop26 climate change talks in Glasgow, the letter to the Prime Minister by Professor Sir David King said.

The secret ballot took place at Lampeter, Ceredigion.
Those who voted in favour fell short of the two-thirds needed for change.
Sixty one of 120 members present voted for such ceremonies to be allowed, while 50 voted for no change and nine to allow blessings.
The Archbishop of Wales, Dr Barry Morgan, said: ""It would be a very brave or perhaps a very foolish Bench of Bishops who were to bring the bill before the governing body at this stage.
""Because that might just rip the church apart and lead to the acrimony that has been absent from this debate.""
The governing body is made up of the Bench of Bishops - the six diocesan bishops - plus 51 clergy and 86 non-clerical representatives.

The governing body had voted in favour of legislation that would have given gay people in same-sex relationships the right to civil partnerships, which offer most of the legal protections of marriage.
The vote to overturn came after a surprise intervention by Bishop Reginald Perrin, who had said he intended to vote against the legislation, which ultimately fell 46 votes short of support.
Bishop Perrin claimed that granting same-sex couples civil marriage would lead to calls for the church to extend equal protection to polygamous and polygamous-like arrangements.
''`The church said the vote was ""a huge setback for gay rights"" and that it had ""caused much sadness"".
A number of bishops said they intended to vote against the bill and expressed regret at the outcome.

There will be no ‘magic bullet’ to tackle the UK’s energy crisis, industry groups have warned, as the country falls further behind nations already tackling the problem more vigorously. Mark Williams, chief executive of the Energy Networks Association (ENA), said there was little chance that energy companies could keep growing electricity generation or cutting carbon emissions while the UK economy shrinks.

Trade is slowing, interest rates are dropping, and inflation is slowing, but supply chain problems (the shortages are hitting consumers and those in high-priced cities just as bad), rising oil/gas prices, and a slowing US economy are creating major problems for the global economy.'' The body paragraph is about the problem of growing inequality as shown by the chart: ""Global Inequality and the Role of the US in the Global Economy. Global Inequality"".

   ``````` The author writes that ```The global economy has grown less responsive to domestic shocks in the 1990s and a combination of geopolitical tensions and climate change might be making matters worse, threatening to plunge the US and the world into a new recession''. The main reasons behind the economic crisis are the fact that it was unexpected and the global supply chains are not able to work as well anymore. For example, an iPhone is dependent on hundreds, even thousands of parts that are manufactured by different companies all over the world, but even if Apple could fix that, they would still have to ship that phone to a particular store somewhere, which is impossible with a global pandemic that's going around.

I found a way by using a web service to fetch the text, concatenate its HTML, and generate the plain-text summary sentence.

However, getting the proper number of articles used for this task proved to be a difficult task.  My solution involved calling the web service two times, getting the number of articles from the original web service, and repeating the process until the number of articles was right.

Key messages
Economic data are highly correlated, so that a sharp decline can be seen in some regions and not in others. For example, in the Euro area there is a sharp decline mainly due to COVID-19 and other lockdowns on people's activities, but the unemployment has only risen by 8.5%, not 15+%. Therefore, in Europe only those in the hospitality industry and restaurant owners are suffering. There are big differences between different sectors in the US economy. The decline is much sharper in the entertainment industry, for example, where there are far more services and contact intensive businesses.

There are important differences among countries. Many countries outside of the EU and the US have taken strong measures to combat COVID-19, lockdowns and bans on activities while also taking countermeasures including government aid packages and lower taxes. For example, the EU has spent 2.6€ trillion (USD 2.85 trillion) so far and the US has put around $1 trillion (USD 1,2 trillion) into its pandemic response"

Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth. The global economic climate is expected to deteriorate further as the impact of the pandemic will be long-lasting and the recovery slower than predicted. Furthermore, geopolitical tensions present an additional risk to economic stability. The COVID-19 shock is now being felt on multiple fronts with rising cases of cases around the world, disrupting supply chains, prompting demand destruction, and triggering widespread panic selling. In fact, the uncertainty is likely to persist well into 2021, which makes an imminent and sizeable fiscal stimulus from central banks all the more necessary to help mitigate the economic fallout from the pandemic. Also, increased tensions over the situation in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of the U.S. troops, which threatens a broader conflict, adds additional uncertainty to the global economy.

Example B : A/B testing for two headlines

When creating headlines, one of the most important considerations is the relative prominence of the two headlines. This is usually done by comparing (or A/B testing) the two headlines against each other (usually at equal prominence) and, based on the outcome, a certain headline is replaced with the other, while maintaining the relative order, using CSS positioning. Depending on how you choose the headlines, the headlines may be competing for the same eyeballs, making a headline that is slightly higher or more prominent than another"

Article: A new study demonstrates that climate change will cause unprecedented sea level rise and increase in global flood risk by inundating vast swathes of land. Researchers at Stanford University analysed land-atmosphere interactions and the effect of rising sea levels on land surfaces to project how future climate change could exacerbate flooding and inundate cities and settlements around the world.

According to the IMF, world economic growth was expected to be negative by 4.4 per cent in 2020. Even before the pandemic broke, growth was expected to be slower than at any point since the 2008 financial crisis. The outlook is worse for developing countries, with growth expected to decline sharply as a consequence of the pandemic, and many economies facing a dire situation. Even in relatively wealthy countries like the United Kingdom, economic and social costs of the pandemic could be high. The fiscal, monetary, and welfare-transfer responses adopted by the United Kingdom to date have helped contain and mitigate those impacts. However, in general, these fiscal, monetary, and welfare-transfer responses will be insufficient to address deep imbalances in the global system and their adverse effects on the global socio-economic landscape. The economic and health disruptions caused by the pandemic are likely to have serious long-term implications on the distribution and allocation of resources, and exacerbate poverty, inequality and inequalities, environmental degradation, and increase climate change, biodiversity loss, and air pollution.

Caroline Lucas, the co-leader of the Green party, said the move would help the world reach net zero emissions - and would also save money.
She told a global climate event hosted by the Organisation.
of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that the UK would make the change ""very quickly and very simply"".
She said the move would reduce emissions by about 2.4 gigatons of carbon by 2030, which is 40% of current emissions worldwide, and ""that is enough to hit our climate targets - that is just about halving our current use of fossil fuels"".
Caroline Lucas, the co-leader of the Green party, said the move would help the world reach net zero emissions Credit:
A gigatonne is more than 1,000 megatons.
The claim came as ministers were urged to tackle the UK's ""toxic"" air by bringing in tougher emissions caps on industry.
Last year, the UK achieved net zero emissions for electricity and heat by 2030, but that only applies to emissions from electricity generation.

Yes, I can see why. After signing up for the trial, there was a short quiz about the news and my experience/knowledge of sports. After I submitted the answer to the questions, it asked if I would like a subscription or not. It's just a trial, but even if I sign into a credit card, I have to cancel it (before the billing date) to get my money back, which is a bit weird.

How to solve this problem?
In the past if you have solved this problem using the same type of system then try to make your code as simpler and small as possible as your code is much more probable to include in one of the summary articles. See that I have separated the summary and the description with a line break.

But there is something more complicated. Suppose that there is no article that has the same text with the same summary. What would you do next? You just leave the summary in plain text without article, summary and description. What would happen? The answer is that the article and the description would be taken from the description in plain text rather than from the description in HTML. That is something that you do not want because the HTML description tells much more about an article than the simple plain text.

94675,3,"Article: Airbus's decision to break away from EADS, the French and German aerospace group, will put the European plane giant on course for record profits this year as the company's business model takes off. Airbus, which has been battered by a slowdown in air travel, is expected to increase earnings per share to as much as 7.7 euros after it launches at least three aircraft in the next few years. The move by Europe's leading plane maker has been predicted since early 2011, and the firm was expected to wait until that date to begin its formal separation from EADS. The move frees Airbus from the group's shareholding structure while maintaining an umbrella company that will act as a holding vehicle for the group's assets. The deal will see the parent company renamed as A340-500 European Aviation Industry, making it independent, although it will carry the E-AISN name until December 31 2014. The deal is expected to cost the company between 500 million-1 billion euros ($680 million-$1.3 billion).

When it comes to trade deals, the devil is in the detail.

Successful negotiations require a skilled - and large - team, but the UK has not negotiated a trade deal since 1973.

3. The first table has an asterisk at the bottom which tells the reader that this table only shows data up to 2009.

4. In some cases there are alternative summary data provided; but only one is used in calculating the Global Trends in Conflict tables, so these will always appear.

The article has a short description of the key facts, and then a longer, more detailed main point (which contains the summary), which is also accompanied by a brief (1 sentence) summary.

The main point is about the global growth slowdown, and it refers to data from the World Bank, the OECD and the International Monetary Fund.

It is an opinion piece that focuses on the impact on the people without economic power.
The main point is that the current economic policies and priorities do not address the underlying problems that are slowing down the growth.

A summary is a condensed version of an article or news account, often designed to offer an overview of a topic in order to quickly inform the reader. The first step in generating a summary is the selection of the appropriate type of source. Examples include news feeds on social media, news articles, blog postings, etc. Each stream of information is then parsed to extract important content such as the title, the abstract, keywords, the most important facts in the article, the most important quotes, etc. In this paper we have defined the term summary as a condensed version of an item, as defined by the authors. However, the extraction tool has the freedom to select the appropriate summary information in any context. To achieve this a semantic engine is implemented to provide a context for each item. Extracted information is then filtered to extract an overall summary. Finally, we evaluate the extraction tool in a set of simulated sources. Our results confirm the effectiveness of the extraction tool, and show its power to select the summary information.

98798,1,"As a result of COVID-19, economic pressures, and geopolitical tensions, a global recession is likely and the global economy and stock market are vulnerable to further shocks. Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets. These initiatives are largely inadequate, however, and there are major limits to what policymakers can achieve to avert further shocks. As inflation remains an unresolved issue, the monetary policy authorities will likely maintain their ultra-accommodative stance for several years with the ultimate objective of bringing inflation and unemployment in line. The governments have also limited influence over global events, and they face a fundamental challenge in the form of geopolitical dynamics, in particular those involving India, China, the Middle East, and Europe. These forces could exacerbate domestic problems and trigger a negative feedback loop into a full-blown trade war, a surge in geopolitical tensions, or an increased risk of global economic fragility. Achieving significant economic reforms will require policy coordination across a broad range of sectors and at the federal, state, and local levels. These reforms should be focused on enhancing productivity and efficiency while simultaneously addressing market failures that are creating poverty and inequality.

> We find that the UK economy can be expected to fall by about 5.5% relative to its pre-EU level in the five years immediately following UK exit.
> This is in contrast to the Eurozone which would suffer a fall of about 0.8%. Further, the EU-wide fall in GDP is more severe – the Eurozone would fall by 6.4%, relative to GDP per current member states, and the EU as a whole would fall by about 7%.
> We find that a number of factors, together, could produce such a fall in the UK. To start with, trade with the EU as a whole is projected to fall by about 19% relative to pre-EU levels in the five years immediately following EU exit. This is larger than any trade impact in the rest of the world.

Global growth is likely to decline to only a bit above 2 percent in 2020. This would be a sharp decline from last year, the slowest since the financial crisis.
Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic is putting unprecedented strains on the global economy, which is set to contract sharply in the first half of 2020 before rebounding. In particular, the pandemic is inflicting severe damage on global manufacturing, tourism, trade, and supply chains. In terms of the recovery, it is very uncertain. It will depend on the extent to which the pandemic is brought under control, and how much economic disruption and uncertainty persists.
The policy measures taken by governments worldwide have made a difference so far to the extent that they have dampened the rise in the volatility of financial markets; supported economic activity and financial stability; and allowed some countries to limit economic declines. However, the near-term economic effects are likely to be severe.

But the cost of infrastructure development is high, and a growing portion of the cost is rising. To get more people back and to stay in employment, we need to encourage more investment. Investment includes in roads, airports, ports, renewable energy facilities, pipelines, and the like.
We must balance that investment against other needs. To get more people to school and work, many education institutions are in need of renovation.
And, to support jobs and the economy, we must make sure that our roads, airports, ports, renewable energy facilities, pipelines, and the like are available and easy to use for everyone.

 Article: ""She was very anxious as she watched the images in the media about the COVID-19 pandemic,"" one of his friends described the suspect, identified only as ZX.
Prosecutors claim that ZX, a 47-year-old father of three, had watched footage of the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918 and thought he could prevent another such global crisis.
According to prosecutors, ZX paid a couple €1,800 (£1,500) to murder the woman, an organiser of the annual German Oktoberfest.
The woman was targeted because she had previously been romantically involved with ZX, and in an email to his accomplices had criticised German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier for not doing enough for the economy.
A source told the BBC that ZX, who is said have links to organised crime, had been trying to use her ""to finance his criminal activity"".
The two suspects allegedly agreed to split the €1,800 in two, with €700 (£590) handed over to the pair for the murder and €400 held back.

41170,0,"The global economy is grappling with unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change.''

The reason the plain-text sentence is more correct is because it says ""the global economy"" instead of ""the global economy is"".
Not to mention the phrase ""combined impact"" can be expanded to ""to the combined impact"". While in the plain-text the sentence is simple it can also be expanded as it contains a preposition, as can the summary sentence.

I'd agree that 'to the combined impact' can be expanded. I think, however, that it needs the apostrophe (""is to the combined impact""), but maybe others would disagree. As I see it, 'global economy' could well be seen as one word.

How would you feel if your organisation adopted the word ""to be"" when speaking."
41170,1,"Ed Miliband, the leader of Britain’s Labour Party, has set out his party’s vision for the next Parliament with a speech in which he will accuse the Conservative government of “the greatest generation”-like ideological rigidity and, as the result of eight years of Tory policy-making, an economy on its knees. Miliband’s address to the centre-left think tank Onward this morning is expected to be an important contribution to the debate about the way forward after the May 7 election. This speech marks a significant departure from the policies pursued by either side of the political divide over the past eight years. It is the first of a series of policies intended to draw Labour to the centre ground of British politics, with an eye towards building up momentum for a new centrist political party in the longer run. Miliband is set to reiterate his intention to clear Britain’s debt as quickly as possible, but he may also be emboldened by the growing evidence that Labour’s fiscal credibility is beginning to shine through. A recent poll by YouGov suggested that 39 percent believe that Labour would be able to pay down Britain’s debts without cutting public spending. This is a remarkable turnaround from the start of the campaign when only 14 percent of"

41170,3,"Ed Miliband knows he has a problem and can sense an opportunity. The problem is Labour's lack of economic credibility – something every opinion poll confirms. The opportunity is the chance to paint the Tories as ideologically obsessed with cutting borrowing. He and Ed Balls believe that their lack of credibility is rooted not in the lack of understanding of their detailed economic policies, but in their perceived inability to say ""no"" to more spending. Hence the headline from this speech is a warning that ""unprotected departments"" i.e. any other than the NHS and overseas aid, will face real cuts every year until the deficit is cleared. One thing.
The basic point is that the summary could be from any party's manifesto. So what we have here is a PR tactic, in which Ed Miliband does something he isn't supposed to do: tell the truth.

I agree that the problem is _the lack of economic credibility_, in the short-term.
However, Miliband is talking about his plan to deal with the deficit not the credibility of his party.
Achieving credibility means demonstrating you're ""on track"", i.e. your plan is working as intended, and the next government will continue on that path if it makes sense to do so. And it is"

Summary:

A global crisis is hitting everyone -- the middle class, the poor, the rich, the poor, and those in between. It has become clear that things cannot continue the way they were. As the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates, the globe is facing unprecedented challenges -- both human and environmental -- that threaten to reverse decades of progress. The COVID-19 crisis demonstrates that our global economy is fragile -- not unlike a house of cards that could collapse at any moment. It's hard to imagine what the world would be like without the internet, or without the mobile phone, or without the automobile, or without the airplane. But as these breakthrough technologies emerge, it will also be difficult to envision a world without some degree of technological advancement, and that is what's at risk. When the world economy is in balance, that's good for consumers, too. When we go on a spending spree, other people have to pay -- ultimately. As consumers, it is the middle class that has always been targeted for taxation -- not the rich. But the tax system is not structured this way, and as a result, when the economy slows down, those at the"

Summarize with text from the outline to match Article and Summary as listed below:
Article summary: The economy is at greater risk in the next year due to global crises that include the covid-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change.  The triple threat of the covid-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change, has put the economy at risk in the next year.
Over the past year, the global economy has already been hit by the pandemic that has disrupted supply chains. That led to inflationary pressures, which worsened existing inequalities.  Economists do not expect things to improve quickly, and hope governments around the world come up with a solution as soon as possible.

Use the following as a reference for your summary. (Note: The article itself appears with the plain text.)

If I want to know what the article covers, I usually use the article with URL as a starting point.
It allows me to skim the article, then look through the URLs for specific topics, then skim the summaries for links to other articles, then go to those articles for more information.

95260,2,"A government spokesman said: ‘It is an important role and for the individual to be able to carry it out successfully, they need the support from MPs across the Commons.’ Ms Mills, currently head of the Department of Parliamentary Services in Canberra, was recommended for the post earlier this month following an open recruitment process with a selection panel led by Mr Bercow. He is believed to be keen to bring in an outsider to press ahead with modernisation of the House, rather than an insider. However, MPs on both sides of the Commons have complained that her lack of experience and knowledge on parliamentary procedure will make it difficult for her to take on the responsibilities in the post. They have also accused the Speaker of undermining parliamentary democracy by using his position to secure a job for a friend, effectively bypassing the civil service as an independent appointment. The role of Clerk of the Commons is described as the ‘first port of call when an MP has a question or a problem or a view’. The main clerk’s job is to advise the Speaker and the government on the procedures of Parliament. This duty is delegated to other clerks, who head the three Lords and House committees, known as the Black Rods, as well as the four parliamentary committees. The"

Miss Mills' selection has been criticized by MPs on all sides, warning that she lacks the knowledge to advise Parliament on constitutional matters. The Government has confirmed that Miss Mills' appointment will be put to Parliament for a vote as soon as possible. Downing Street yesterday confirmed the Conservative leader had not forwarded the nomination to the Queen for approval, despite having had it for at least ten days.

 Answer:

The summary sentence is
  an aggregation of sentences from the abstract, while the summary URL is the URL of an abstract in a different paragraph of the
article. The summarised sentence is in inverted commas; so, the URL will be  or.

 Question: What is the link between this summary sentence and the URL listed above?

 Answer:

There are two different URL links in this example -- one for the abstract, and the other for the main body. We have not
included them in the URL, because they belong to two different sentences.

The URL for the main body of a paper,

is shown with double quotes. This is a common way to represent URLs in plain text, as some browsers do not like them otherwise -- for example,

Summary text is also used as part of article summaries to create ""chapters"" in a book format, which are presented to a reader with the full text, a summary of the summary, and notes and comments that provide a way of interpreting the text, and with hyperlinks to the full text of the summary.

53778,3,"''The global economy is faced with three intertwined problems: climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and heightened geopolitical tensions. These problems are making it harder to achieve sustained global economic growth, raising the question of whether we can achieve the goal of reducing poverty and the wealth gap within the next 20 years. At the same time, climate change is accelerating the rate of biodiversity loss, resulting in longer-term challenges to human survival. To make ends meet, more and more people are being forced to migrate, and conflicts over natural resources and water supplies are erupting as climate-driven droughts, floods, and other extreme weather effects cause greater food insecurity. As a result of this confluence of environmental emergencies and social crises, we may also be reaching the edge of a structural shift that requires the next generation to tackle an ever-increasing set of environmental, social, and economic challenges. In this context, there's a pressing need to accelerate innovation in green technologies.

7459,3,"The global economy is facing a crisis and a series of severe challenges due to the impact of three big trends: globalisation, climate change and global power competition. The combined impact of these challenges has led to a severe slowdown in growth, a widening gap between the global North and the South and a serious weakening in the position of the international financial system as the world's principal lender of last resort. Policymakers have responded with monetary and fiscal policy stimulus measures, tax cuts as well as fiscal spending increases. More measures, with greater scope, are inevitable. If such measures fail to restore global economic resilience then the response to these major challenges will have to go much further than policymakers have been prepared to acknowledge up to now.```

The problem statement:
We want to design a system that can analyze a news article and summarize it for the user.

The proposed algorithm should analyze the text and generate a summary based on it.
The algorithm should also automatically write a summary of the original text at the bottom of the page.
The summary should be a minimum of 500 characters.

The proposed solution:
Generate a summary of a news article based on a predefined set of rules. The user reviews the summarized text and can click on the original news article to read the full text. The summarization should not include hyperlinks or lists. The user should be able to select the rules as required.

User requirements:

This is a fairly simple problem to solve. The first sentence is wrong. In context, it clearly states that the economy is ""facing,"" then later clarifies that the economy is ""struggling,"" not ""facing."" The second sentence is also poorly written, as it does not state a fact while stating a point. It states that ""the global growth rate has slowed considerably"" then goes on to state that this is due to several factors, but not the COVID-19 virus. The third sentence is much better, but does not explain the correlation or causation between the events stated.

The solution.

20840,0,"The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change.''

The USA is pushing through legislation to turn the orbiting facility back into something like the “Space Shuttle on steroids”, which means an explosion of costs, a reduction in science, and an attempt to privatize the space station. It is also pushing a new version of the “US space bill” which would strip away the ability of international organizations to do scientific work that is in line with the US science enterprise, and put the government out of the business of sending things to space, thus putting science back in the hands of private enterprise. In short, it would be a space program where scientific and business interests are pitted against each other. ```

95820,2,"The global economy is growing at an uneven pace.
	While the global economic outlook was good before the summer of 2013, political uncertainties and worries over an economic slowdown dampened economic activity. The recovery from the recession of 2008 and 2009 has been uneven with some countries continuing to see high levels of unemployment. The economic slowdown in Europe resulted in a significant slowdown of both domestic and global economic activity. Some emerging market (EM) countries have also seen declining economic activity because of the impact of the slowdown in the US and Europe.	However, many of these countries have grown significantly in recent years, raising their standard of living and expanding the demand for imported goods and services. The global recovery from the recession has been supported by many factors, including central bank and other policies designed to stimulate economic activity. In addition, stimulus measures, including significant reductions in interest rates from the Bank of Japan, have supported economic growth in that region. These and other factors reduced global poverty for the first time in two decades, and economic growth in some emerging economies, including China, continued.

As the pandemic stretches into a second year and more than 100,000 people have died, governments around the world are working out how to pay for their rescue packages as deficits soar.
That means that the system of representative democracy remains flawed. For it to function, representatives must represent the views of their constituents. Yet, increasingly, they don’t.
In recent decades, more than 90 percent of voters have made a choice at the ballot box. Yet, even if they express their opinion, the politicians elected by them never truly represent their views—at least, not in the long term. Their main job is to keep their jobs. So they concentrate on the people who have voted them in.
Indeed, the same politicians are constantly looking to stay in power. So, in their eyes, what’s good for their constituents is frequently bad for the rest of the country. Indeed, the policies of politicians are consistently bad for the economy as a whole. It’s the same at the local level: councillors seek to please their constituents.

INTERPRETATION OF THE TERM 'POST-ECONOMIC
STIMULUS.'

 Abstract: The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. Economic growth has slowed considerably across both developed and developing nations. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are exacerbating economic inequalities, making it harder for low-income families to afford basic necessities. Governments nationwide are responding to these challenges with a mix of fiscal stimuluses, policy reforms, and support packages designed to stabilize markets and foster sustainable growth.

57677,3,"This article discusses what has been happening to the global economy due to the continued COVID-19 pandemic, which, in addition to increased tensions between the U.S. and China, is exacerbating effects of climate change. This may contribute to a slowdown in global trade but has not yet led to a global recession. In addition, rising unemployment and inflationary pressures from the massive government aid packages around the world are creating considerable economic turbulence. These impacts threaten to increase inequalities between the world’s wealthier and poorer nations.

The situation is particularly problematic because the World Bank estimates that the pandemic-induced economic downturn will reduce global GDP by 4.4% on an annualized basis until the end of 2020 and increase poverty by an astonishing 11.9%; this could happen for as many as 135 million people. A massive response plan from the most advanced nations in the world is reducing that estimate somewhat, but the fact remains that many countries in the developing world are not equipped to fight or recover from a global health crisis. The International Monetary Fund estimates that even if countries around the world are able to contain the pandemic, global growth in 2021 will still be 2.4% below what it would be if the virus had not hit the world.

 Article: By. BBC News. Published:. 23:23 EST, 18 January 2013. |. Updated:. 08:01 EST, 19 January 2013. A radio show which asks listeners to call in and describe personal messages of love to each other as ‘Sunday Love Songs’ has been ruled to have breached the BBC's guidelines on accuracy and transparency. The BBC Trust ruled the show breached its guidelines by failing to inform listeners properly during its broadcast. The trust said the show breached guidelines by failing to make clear dedications were made prior to the recording, and that callers were not informed of dedications which had not been selected for broadcast. Audience members have complained they were left distressed after their requests were not broadcast - with some even spending money phoning in only to find their messages would not make it onto Saturday's show. The BBC Trust's editorial standards committee said the failings of the show had ""caused or contributed to the distress"" which listeners had described. A spokesman for Wright's show also admitted the on-air and phone-in messages failed to make it clear listeners' dedications would only consider a single recording - not the programme as a whole.

17860,3,"Global Economy Tanked in 2nd Quarter as Virus Pandemic Hit

Global economic growth slowed sharply in the second quarter and the outlook has darkened as the coronavirus pandemic threatens to push the world into recession. A global slump is being anticipated due to the ongoing outbreak, which has infected more than 6 million people, killing some 375,000, according to an AP tally.
The second-quarter decline in global gross domestic product -- the broadest gauge of economic output -- was expected to be 4.3%. A report by the Asian Development Bank estimated a contraction of 5%.
The data underscores the damaging impact of the pandemic on business activity around the world. Supply-chain disruptions have raised costs, while weak consumer demand, which accounts for about 70% in GDP, has suppressed spending.
GDP reports are likely to become even less reliable as the year progresses and are subject to considerable revision. Governments around the world are providing emergency stimulus that could result in the loss of tax income in the months ahead. The International Monetary Fund last week made a grim prediction that the global economy would shrink 3% this year in a “worst-case scenario.”
Most economic analysts expect a partial recovery after the second half of the year, but they"

The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change.

Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are exacerbating economic inequalities, making it harder for low-income families to afford basic necessities. Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth.
Given the recent economic slowdown and geopolitical tensions, it is natural and appropriate to examine the most likely causes of this slowdown. The current macroeconomic slowdown is related to the combination of the pandemic (health system disruption and lockdown measures), the increased risk of a further flare-up (re-ignition of the pandemic and new waves of infections), geopolitical tensions (U.S.-China trade conflict, tensions in the Middle East), and climate change (rising temperatures and extreme weather). These challenges pose significant global economic risks, and they could lead to further economic slowdown.
These challenges are also likely to lead to a change in the current structure of global value chains (GVCs). While there has"

In the U.S., growth has slowed to barely 1% in Q2 of 2017, and is expected to fall even further in Q3, likely to less than around 3%. While the global situation may improve in due course, the risks of a recession in the U.S. cannot be ignored. Meanwhile, the risks of a recession in the eurozone and the UK remain considerable as well. On the plus side, the UK's Q2 growth rate of 0.7% was the highest of any G7 nation in 2017. Inflation is in check, and monetary and fiscal policy decisions in the developed world, namely the Federal Reserve and the UK's Bank of England, respectively, are expected to remain on hold; however, the risks of a further rise in U.S. interest rates cannot be discounted, and the ongoing saga of Brexit remains far from resolved.

70065,3,"By combining an analysis of global GDP data for 2010-2014 with our unique dataset of geopolitical events, we find that in the 2012-2014 period, increased demand for natural resources and a slowdown in domestic economic activity accounted for much of the difference in economic performance of developing nations. We also find that while the 2008 global financial crisis and the ongoing European debt crisis contributed to slower growth throughout the world, other drivers—in particular a decrease in economic volatility experienced by developing nations, the impact of the global financial crisis on the growth of exports within Europe, and ongoing Chinese GDP growth—contributed to the relatively high level of performance of developing countries in these recent two years. In addition, we find that the relative resilience of the current crisis was much greater among advanced economies than developing countries. We estimate that between a third and a half of the variation in growth rates across developing countries was due to the direct effect of COVID-19, and the direct effect of geopolitical tensions was even"

A recent report states that disasters and associated costs will increase by 20 per cent by 2025. The economic impact of these disasters is particularly great for developing countries, where climate change is having a disproportionate effect. With millions facing poverty due to the pandemic and rising debt levels, the impact is particularly devastating. As temperatures rise globally, extreme weather is becoming more damaging to human and animal health and will have significant implications for global food security. Climate change will lead to droughts across most of Africa in the coming years and food security will be significantly impacted. The global South will be disproportionately affected and this could cause a severe human rights crisis for millions.

97879,1,"The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with geopolitical tensions and climate change, is leading to a sharp downturn in economic activity. Governments have reacted with significant fiscal support and other economic stimulus packages. Nevertheless, market participants are increasingly concerned with the sustainability of the recovery and the implications for financial assets. Low-income households across the globe continue to face challenges in procuring basic necessities, which is exacerbating socioeconomic inequalities, posing unique risks to society and ultimately the global economy.
As the recovery in global economic activity gains momentum, policymakers will need to evaluate how to respond in a way that is inclusive and sustainable. This is crucial given heightened levels of political polarization that are making policymaking particularly difficult.
While market participants view significant policy easing as a likely consequence of the pandemic, it is uncertain whether large-scale fiscal measures will prove effective. It is also uncertain whether targeted fiscal fiscal support will lead to a sustained recovery, particularly in the low-income countries of the Emerging Market and Developing Countries (EMDC) group. This is of particular concern given the disproportionate challenges the group faces in responding to the pandemic.

The economic impact of the lockdowns to contain the virus pandemic will likely bring economic growth to a halt this year. GDP growth in major economies, however, might improve in the fourth quarter of this year, with further improvement to more than 5% (pre-pandemic levels) by 2021. The United States remains the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic, although more countries have moved to ease restrictions as the situation improves.

Governments are responding with support packages to sustain economic activity while maintaining strong fiscal positions. Global trade has been disrupted and growth is projected to slow. There are several structural issues that have created long-term hurdles, and it remains unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic will unfold. On the positive side, technology has been an important enabler during the crisis. We expect low rates for the next few years, which should support the recovery. The high level of uncertainty makes it difficult to project future conditions with confidence.''

I would like to focus on the first sentence, ```The global economy has come under pressure due to COVID, geopolitical tensions, and climate change.''
The question is, how could someone come under pressure when there is no ""pressure""?
How could a tree come under pressure when there is no pressure on it.
Let me ask the same question in simpler terms for my readers.
Why do you consider the economy to be under pressure, i.e. in what way is it under ```pressure`''.
How would you come under this ```pressure`'.
Does it have to do with the situation of the economy."

The impact of COVID-19 will accelerate the rise in income and wealth inequality, which will have negative social and economic consequences.

They were first linked with moves to Manchester back in November 2018.
The pair worked together at Barcelona for a decade.
Some football fans believe the Premier League is now a two-horse race, with Guardiola's current side Bayern Munich, and Mourinho's Manchester United a direct rival.
Will they be as successful in the Premier League?
That's up to the fans to decide.
We've also got a selection of other articles here.

I am guessing the summary is ""Jose Mourinho was announced as the new manager at Manchester United and Pep Guardiola was announced as the new manager at Manchester City.""

I find the second is the easier one to remember, so it is now. The second one uses more of the original summary words.

I agree with the second one, but I think the two-column version is easier. That's mainly because I have a tendency to read the headline first before any of the text.

I don't think a single word will work for both. The first has more words but I think it comes first. Also it highlights the most important words, in this case highlighting ""slow"".

I like the two column versions--especially with a bold header so it stands out.

If, for a given summary, you try to use all the same words as the original, is it worth it? Is it like memorizing a short story and retelling it word for word, or does familiarity of presentation contribute to remembering and understanding what you are being told?

I'm wondering if there's any merit to the idea of using words that are _the same sort_ of word,"

Article: At the height of the Cold War, former Labour cabinet minister Tony Benn was considered by the Soviet Union an `unnecessary simpleton' who was too stupid to recruit as an agent, Oleg Gordievsky, the KGB defector who was tasked with spying for the KGB for an entire decade since 1974, has claimed. Gordievsky claimed that if KGB considered Benn as a potential agent, he would ruin the balance of the Cold War as he is `not truthful'.

From a survey in 2018, it found that half of Americans had never heard of the 25th amendment, the procedure by which a US President could be removed.
Another third claimed to be unaware that Vice Chancellor James Corden used to host a US TV show called ‘Corden’.
We thought we’d help by summarising some of the central issues at stake in this election. We’ll start with the question we thought was the most critical: what’s a senator?
A senator is a member of the US Senate, sometimes referred to as a Senator. In practice, they are chosen by states and not elected by the people in the same way as a member of parliament is.
And they’re appointed – or in the case of former senators, elected back in a job as President Donald Trump was when he was first elected - for six years.
Each senator from the states which are a part of the state they represent has a vote on everything that goes on in the Senate. In the Senate, only members have a vote, not the President, and the US population is approximately three-fifths of the"

The word ""pregnant"" is taken as the primary word. It is searched for all instances in which it is mentioned in the article, with the exception of an article discussing pregnancy in a fictional setting.

After the word ""supply"" is found the phrase ""supply chain disruptions"" is searched for. We then look for all references in which the supply chain is mentioned and the number of those is added to the total.

After the phrase ""inflationary pressures"" is found the phrase ""policy reforms"" is searched for. Then comes the phrase ""support packages"" and so on.

50533,1,"In a nutshell, the global economy is faced with numerous challenges due to the combined impact of climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic growth has slowed considerably both across developed and developing nations, although there are signs of recovery at the end of 2020. Supply chain disruptions to many commodities, such as oil and metals, are forcing governments worldwide to find new ways to procure these commodities as well as to mitigate the impacts of inflationary pressures on the already fragile low-income communities worldwide. Several stimulus packages are at play, though, the greatest concern is whether the global economy will recover in time to maintain the levels of demand that are needed to sustain a sustained recovery in business activity and employment.

16258,3,"The Covid 19 pandemic is severely impacting economies worldwide. These disruptions are especially acute in India, Brazil and Mexico, places with weak health care systems and very high poverty rates. Yet poor countries are disproportionately unable to respond as they lack the necessary resources. This is despite global consensus that rich as well as poor countries need to invest to strengthen public expenditure systems and develop human capabilities. One important way to alleviate this debt burden and improve the health of vulnerable populations in poor countries is to increase international public debt relief. There are numerous possible pathways for this, including the G20 debt suspension initiative discussed at the Summit in June. However, greater flexibility and speed in reducing debt burden would be more effective in helping the hardest hit countries recover from the Covid crisis. We believe that any eventual debt settlement should target both public and official debt, not necessarily solely government debt as targeted by the G20. Moreover, any debt relief initiative should be focused on low-income countries that will need additional support to recover from the pandemic.

But once the response to the fire was underway, he called the dispatch center twice and told them he was seceding from the United States because he was angry with the federal government and wanted to start a country called Dougiestan. `I'm Dougie Doug and I just seceded from the nation. I've seceded from North America. I'm starting my country,' the caller told the dispatcher in a recording of the call. Leguin then opened fire on police, telling them he was seceding.

There are more than 84,000 people on the payroll in Wales, 8,000 more than at the same time last year, and the employment level is up by more than 5,000.

61218,4,"A UK Government minister has dismissed calls to introduce a financial transaction tax (FTT) on all UK based financial transactions.
The call was made by the Liberal Democrats Treasury spokesman, Liam Byrne, who said: “We need a global levy like the FTT to pay for the NHS and rebuild our economy.”
Responding, Greg Hands, a junior minister at the Department for International Trade said: “Laws such as the new FTT were originally designed to avoid a rerun of the last global financial crash. It is extremely unlikely to benefit the public purse and the current rules are the best protection we have against excessive investment by foreign financial institutions in the UK.
“Any FTT on financial transactions would fall well short of that objective.”
A FTT would also hit London as the City of London is one of the world's most important banking centres, said Mr Hands, and would weaken the UK's attractiveness to international businesses.  A government-imposed FTT would also put a dent in UK business, as the UK has a global reputation as a safe haven for investors, according to the minister.

Rock on: It's thought that comets were responsible for kick-starting life on Earth. Now scientists may have part of the answer. Laboratory experiments have shown that amino acids - organic molecules that are the building blocks of proteins - would have survived violent comet impacts. What is more, the shock of a large comet impact would have provided the energy needed to start bonding amino acids together to make proteins. Proteins provide the raw material that allows all living things, from microbes to humans, to exist and function. Their creation by comets may explain how life appeared so quickly at the end of a period 3.8 billion years ago called the ‘late heavy bombardment’. During this turbulent time the Earth was showered by both comets and rocky asteroids, leaving crater scars that are still seen on the Moon.

  In the wake of the U.S.-China trade wars comes a new round of tensions between Washington and Beijing as China pushes for the establishment of an investment deal between the two countries.

U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators continued to hold talks on a so-called Phase 1 trade agreement to de-escalate tensions between the two largest economies.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the United States had made some major progress toward achieving a deal with China’s top trade negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, during a phone call Thursday night, though the two sides remained at odds on several issues, including intellectual property and trade secrets.

A deal would represent a partial victory for the United States. Investors had anticipated an announcement of"

Governments around the world are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth.
The global economic upturn is anticipated to resume in the second half of 2021 as containment efforts are lifted, though economic prospects are expected to remain subdued due to lingering downside risks.

As inflationary pressures persist, economic stimulus measures in developed markets include higher spending on social programmes and infrastructure development. Fiscal loosening and low interest rates are expected to provide further impetus to the global economy. On a broader basis, the new growth cycle will be defined by the capacity of emerging markets and developing countries to manage the effects of the pandemic and its health and economic consequences.

As shown above, the plain-text summary sentence can sometimes be a significant differentiator in our ability to match.  I have found using a sentence fragment (sentence fragment 1) with multiple lists (sentence fragment 2) using the same plain text keyword (sentence fragment 3) has been one of the most effective ways in which to match.  Most times, it provides an opportunity to break the text in a way to break the search engines focus.

-- Fiscal stimulus in advanced economies reached around 7.0 percent of GDP in 2020, or around $7.7 trillion. This spending was equivalent to 20 percent of pre-crisis GDP in most countries. The US, the UK and the EU led the way in terms of policy package (nearly $6 trillion).

Question: How might I condense the above into a headline that is more succinct, and makes the summary more interesting to the reader? The article has been published by the New York Times. Its summary was included at the end of the article. Any suggestions or thoughts welcome.

I think the first sentence works as is. The ""global economy is facing unprecedented challenges"" should highlight the fact that it's global that the article is referring to, and it would work better in a paragraph rather than a sentence, given its length. Maybe ""Global concerns about climate change, geopolitical tensions cause economic strains"" works?

The first sentence does not imply that these challenges are global in scope. It could be global in scale (it certainly is, but"

In what situation does it make sense to summarize two paragraphs in such a way as to distort the meaning of the original?  How do the summary sentences in the articles you read stand up to your own understanding of the original text?

For what it's worth, I always find the plain English interpretation of press articles to be somewhat unsatisfactory, and prefer a translation or, even better, a paraphrase.

For example, if you click on the link above you'll immediately see the summary sentence in the context of the original sentence. The context is all important!

78414,1,"A federal jury has found former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi guilty of tax fraud. Prosecutors had charged that, as prime minister, he had ordered his Mediaset television network -- which the judge called a ""personal fiefdom"" -- to illegally funnel money to his Forza Italia party in exchange for political support. Berlusconi himself was on trial as part of a massive corruption trial involving allegations that he paid young women for sex. However, the Italian billionaire didn't face jail time in that case, and the judge ruled that he would instead serve four years on the tax fraud conviction. Berlusconi, 76, has previously served as Italy's prime minister from 1994 through 2001.

A common feature of many survey-based explanations in psychology (see e.g. ) is the need to explain an apparent relationship between two parameters: a dependent characteristic and a measure of the association between the dependent and independent variable. For example the researchers wanted to explain the relationship between the number of words in a text and the reader satisfaction with the text. They explain the relationship by focusing on a difference in vocabulary size (e.g. words versus syllables) or on the quality of the text or on the frequency of the words compared against other words.

77587,3,"Article: By. Robert H. Regan. PUBLISHED:. 29:30 EST, 29 October 2012. |. UPDATED:. 29:30 EST, 29 October 2012. A growing number of people around the world who are overweight or obese are developing chronic diseases. For some, obesity and physical inactivity have led to the development of health problems such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. Researchers estimate that more than two-thirds of adults in the United States are already overweight or obese, and over one-third of children now are obese. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that one in five U.S adults suffers from heart disease and is at increased risk for developing other chronic health problems, including stroke and type 2 diabetes. Nearly half of all adults in the U.S. — nearly 200 million people – have diabetes, a number the CDC says is only going to increase as more of the baby-boomer generation ages. The CDC estimates that obesity costs the U.S. more than $147 billion per year — more than three times the annual total cost of heart disease, which is now the nation’s most costly killer. Obesity costs society in another way, too. The CDC says"
77587,4,"The global economy is struggling to recover from the double hit of COVID-19 lockdowns and the global recession that followed. The world’s political leaders are working together to manage the health crisis. Their aim is to slow the spread of the virus and ‘flatten the curve’, so as to keep the health services from being overrun by a tsunami of demand for medical attention. Governments are also trying to protect vulnerable households and small- and medium-sized businesses from financial hardship. Stimulus packages aim to keep markets open and prevent a full-on recession which would be even worse for economies already weakened by the pandemic. The result is not always pretty: for example, governments, fearing increased debt levels and the resulting political pressure, are tightening government spending. This is causing a worldwide shortage of some basic goods and slowing down production of others. This, combined with the impact of the recession, is exacerbating inequality and putting people on the margins of society into danger of falling into poverty. Governments worldwide are responding to the challenges by providing stimulus packages, policy changes and financial support. They are also easing access to credit and lowering tax rates and regulations. ```

The total size of the stimulus is now 575 billion pounds or 1.0 percent of Britain’s annual GDP.
This is the largest monetary stimulus in the history of the world with the exception of the hyperinflated economy of Weimar Germany in 1922. The Bank of England claims that it is too early to know whether the additional stimulus will be needed and will be withdrawn before long in case inflation begins to soar. The reason behind the massive stimulus package is to support economic growth which is at a near standstill, to reduce unemployment and to preserve the value of the pound sterling by lowering the cost of living.

31501,3,"Egyptian Troops Kill 5 Migrant Workers In Sinai```

```Egypt's military said on Monday that its forces killed five Sudanese migrants whom it accused of attempting to slip into Israel without proper authorization.
In a statement on the state-run EgyNews web site, the military said that it caught up with the migrants near the frontier with the Gaza Strip, after it had received a tip about a group of Sudanese traveling toward its territory.
The military said its troops then exchanged gunfire with the men, killing five and wounding six others in the desert area and arresting five others.
But one Sudanese activist dismissed the military's account as an attempt to justify the killing of the migrants, which human rights groups say was unjustified, and said his group had already provided a different version of events.
''Our friends in Cairo told us their friends were in shock,'' said Ibrahim Abu Rajab, a Sudanese activist and lawyer based in Cairo, at a press conference Monday afternoon.

In the second running of the race at Epsom, an Irish-bred horse from the stable of Aidan O’Brien broke ranks late in the race and won by three-quarters of a length against good horses from the British Isles.

While the global population will grow exponentially, the average age is already increasing. Around the world there already a wide age gap between young and old people, and even in richer countries this gap is getting larger. The percentage of people over the age of 65 is forecast to rise from 13% today to 23.1% by 2050. A larger elderly population means more pensioners but fewer workers. Since there will be more old people, it is vital that the elderly are given adequate care and support to be able to live with dignity. Otherwise, the care system will break down with huge implications for society. In the developed world in particular, the elderly have a high dependency, a high number of medical needs and a lack of support networks needed to care for them. Furthermore, people will also need to look after themselves and others at home for longer due to the low retirement age.

The basic problem I see, is that the article, and its summary, only refer to Sir Cliff's performance in Parliament as if he was not also a celebrity.  So, a person not familiar with the situation, the article, and the summary would probably see nothing wrong with the summary, especially as Cliff is a celebrity.  Also, I don't think the summary adequately describes what his concerns are, and that they have nothing to do with what others have said.
I think the summary should be rewritten in Cliff's words, referring only to him as ""Sir"". Also, Cliff himself was never named, only the BBC, South Yorkshire Police and South Yorkshire Police Commissioner were, in the article.  The summary should be reworded to reflect Cliff's concerns fully.

Crop science firms see promise in genetic engineering - crop biotech and traits have seen the least scientific interest recently but could be among the biggest gainers from recent advances

The crop science sector is in the midst of a ""renaissance"", according to the annual review and outlook by market research firm Mintel. The report said that the current crop production and biotechnology sector is ""a lot different"" to the sector of a decade ago, suggesting that it is likely to remain an industry to watch in the years ahead. ""We're going through a period of change,"" Jon Dettmer, head of agriculture & food at Mintel commented. This includes the increased availability of yield-improving technologies and the introduction of regulation - including on GMOs - which he said ""is changing the way that crop scientists conduct their work"".

In fact, he argues, it is the pandemic and its economic aftermath that provide the best opportunity for long-term structural reforms that could boost economic growth even after the pandemic is over -- though that would require more investment in education and job-training programs, the availability of paid family leave and child care, and a higher minimum wage.''"

 ``Politics`` is the domain of study of a social science discipline which addresses the organization and the governance of social affairs. (Webster's New World Encyclopedias 9th Ed. page 715)
 ``Politics`` is the theory and practice of decision-making (i.e., decision-making or the decision-making process) by people.  Political thought, philosophy, history, and sociology are disciplines which investigate politics.  Political science is a broad discipline that combines the social sciences with the study of government.  Political science has a number of sub-disciplines, including political theory, political geography, public administration, political sociology and political psychology.``   (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics)

 Article: ''We were just following orders,'' said one of the soldiers in a video.

 Summary: In April the army began a major operation to root out a small number of left-wing rebels fighting in the jungles of Northern Colombia and expel them entirely.
Colombian authorities suspect members of the People's Revolutionary Army are behind a series of recent attacks. The rebel group is believed to have between 600 and 2,000 members.
Soldiers arrested several P.R.E. rebels, while a handful escaped.
Last week, a soldier who was part of the special military unit revealed an interview he had given to a Colombian TV news program, saying the soldiers had executed 19 men, including unarmed civilians, without showing the slightest regard for the dignity of the captured rebels. The soldier has been arrested and faces possible charges.

This slow-down in activity is expected to deepen the divide between richer and poorer states, threatening the long-term sustainable development of the global economy. In particular, the recent rise in inflation expectations and inflation-adjusted government bond yields – often referred to as `bond yield curves` – in the United States, Japan, and several European countries indicate that investors are concerned about rising inflation and a steeper yield curve. These conditions have resulted in a flattening of global bond yields. Policymakers in major economies are responding with a combination of fiscal stimuli and reform efforts. The policies currently being implemented are likely to be insufficient to address the long-term growth challenges. In addition, these policy adjustments may not have the desired effects, owing to the complexity of the global economy, significant time lags in implementing policy, and the emergence of new challenges.

 Hints and tips

When you create a page or post an article for an external client, such as a newspaper or magazine, the summary sentence should only come after the article's title, sub-head, and before a short descriptive paragraph. The reason for this is that you are already providing a summary of the article in the HTML markup that follows the title, sub-head, brief description paragraph, and links, so you only need to give one summary sentence.

You can also use a URL to give the summary sentence as an image. In Internet Explorer, for example, you could take a screenshot of the article's title as text before the main part of the article, and then create an image of the main part of the article. This image would be the source for your page's"

Summary: In the second half of the 2020s, it's likely that economic slowdowns, supply chain disruptions, and increasing government debt will lead global growth to decline. Weaker growth in the developed world may be offset by fast growth in other developing economies. By the end of the 2020s, it's likely that inflationary forces in developing countries will be sufficiently out of control that central banks there will be forced to hike interest rates. In the developed world, central banks will need to follow suit. Weaker growth is especially likely for countries most severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as for countries that must contend with slow growth or outright deflation in some sectors before the end of the decade.

And the sentence's first and last word are different, indicating a difference in level of description between the two.

""I like to eat food... sometimes""  versus ""I like to eat food... sometimes"". The former is a detail that doesn't affect what the sentence is conveying, the latter details something essential to the claim being made.

In linguistics, a detail like that might be called a ""high level"" detail, something that contributes to the ""sense"" of the sentence and perhaps conveys some information about the speaker. A higher layer of the sentence than the ""meaning"", if you will. A very subtle idea, which might make you wonder if you were right, or not.

Yeah, ""high level detail"" was too vague for my liking

(Substracting a few spaces for the html formatting, that's equivalent to this plain-text version which provides the same overview but not as much detail.)

 Subtracting the URL from the summary would produce a plain-text summary, as an example.

 Some news sources will show the URL in a separate box, typically in purple, which is an alternative way to get this information. In this context it is a distraction to the user.

 A plain-text summary that doesn't require the URL, which is a stripped-down version of the same summary, can be made much better by also removing the HTML in the {{article summary}} template (or, as shown above, by stripping the URL from the article summary).

Washington has raised the issue at the G7 by calling for the World Health Organization (WHO) probe into the origins of the virus.

Other Asian countries like Japan and India have shared concerns that China is trying to expand its sphere of influence and its influence in Asian countries.  These views have further grown after the WHO declared China as coronavirus free. Both countries, along with Russia have jointly opposed India's candidature to head the agency.

Add to that other global challenges including geopolitical tensions and global warming. All these factors are combining to create an unprecedented set of challenges, the severity of which have not been seen before. Economies have been hit hard, with major financial markets seeing extreme volatility and declines in price. In the US, many financial markets experienced more than a 40% decline in the weeks following March's peak in daily confirmed cases of COVID-19. In developed economies, governments have been forced to impose tight restrictions like lockdowns. These actions are necessary to save lives, but at the cost of heavy economic damage. The global death toll stands at more than a million people and there has been widespread economic disruption and large scale job losses. The combined impact of these factors is causing extreme pain and hardship for millions of people around the world. Governments around the world have taken action to help mitigate these challenges.

On 27 February 2017, the USA accused Russia of violating provisions of the INF Treaty after Russian forces tested the Novator 9M729 land-based cruise missile at the Iskander launch site in Southern Russia. The missile had the largest range under the provisions of the pact, and was said to be able to reach European cities.

The pandemic has seriously damaged the global supply chains, which have been hit hard by the lockdowns implemented in various countries.

The countries that are importing more than their share of these imported products are at greater risk of economic instability. The pandemic has also impacted the demand for many of these products that are facing supply chain issues.

The global economy is struggling due to COVID-19, geopolitical tensions, and climate change, leading to slower growth, supply chain issues, and increased inequality. Governments are countering these challenges with various support measures.

Key take-aways:

For the global economy, there had been a slowdown in global economic growth over the past few years. The global economy had already seen two oil crises in the first decade of this century, which were a cause of a slowdown.

Climate change and geopolitical tensions have also impacted the global economy because of this, and global economic downturn is expected to take place.

So - when does it help our economy to let Russia do stuff in the Middle East, Syria, and Iraq that we cannot as easily do ourselves (or at least can do to a lesser degree)?
Does that not send a message to our allies that - even if they pay lip service to us - they should be courting Moscow and not us?
And are we not sending the message that our economic/military/humanitarian response is limited to our own problems?

The two articles are above each other (not in the same paragraph) within a paragraph.

Answers

The author of the article states that COVID-19 is not affecting climate change.

The author of the article is mistaken about the pandemic effect COVID-19 will have on climate change. COVID-19 can exacerbate climate change, and the pandemic has worsened global poverty.

A picture of the mouse being interrogated appears to be fake. It is very unlikely that a mouse would eat 2 shekel notes for 200 shekels.

The summary is misleading, as the pandemic has increased wealth disparities by causing income loss to the poorest citizens."

Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth.

```The combined effects of each are disrupting supply chains, eroding consumer confidence, and severely disrupting the pace of recovery from the pandemic. The longer it lasts, the more drastic the impact on economic activity, employment, and poverty is likely to be. The pandemic is also adding to geopolitical tensions that are already affecting global markets and economic activity.

The Seattle Seahawks, bidding to become the first team in a decade to win back-to-back Super Bowls, overcame a 14-point deficit to shock the top-ranked Green Bay Packers 28-22 in overtime Sunday.  The Seahawks rallied behind fourth-year quarterback Russell Wilson, who put up all of seven quarterback rating on the day, and finished with a playoff-record 230 passing yards. Marshawn Lynch, the bruising running back whose one touchdown was a highlight of the night, scored twice in the second half to put Seattle on top.

47087,3,"The global economy faces extraordinary challenges, and it’s likely to get a lot worse. Global output growth is slowing, investment levels are falling, and confidence is crumbling. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s asset purchases are making money cheap, but this isn’t translating into more economic opportunity for more people. COVID-19 poses its own risks. Countries that lack the infrastructure to fight the pandemic are in a race against a deadly surge, which is putting economies and individuals at risk. The climate crisis is also worsening. While the U.S. and Europe are taking steps forward to fight this existential threat, the same can’t be said about much of the rest of the world. If we don’t take bold, decisive action - particularly at a time when countries’ fiscal positions are weak - then the global economy will stagnate and eventually fall into a “stagflation” type of cycle where growth is weak, but inflation continues to rise. Even if the worst doesn’t occur, we have a lot of work to do to build back better. That, in turn, means finding ways to create new economic growth strategies that do a better job of serving ordinary families.```

The real challenge is to decide on the right balance of sentence lengths, which depends on several factors such as the significance of the article's theme, the complexity of the sentence, and how much readers can comprehend that theme from just that sentence alone.

A sentence in plain text (without links or hyperlinks) may contain the following types of information:

 The theme/the main point the author wants to convey
 The supporting details
 Details of the article's key points that are relevant to the theme at hand
 Specifics or the facts on which the article restates its main point
 In some cases, this information may all be contained in just a single sentence.

The plain-text sentence must contain two or more elements, but they do not have to be separate clauses. However, sentences do have to be grammatically correct to the target language. This means that the syntax of the article sentence and its supporting details must be accurate, with no mistakes. For example, if an article headline ends in `''bold''', that"

27271,2,"Manchester City remain locked in discussion with the Premier League as the clock ticks down on their attempts to bring Frank Lampard to the club. Sportsmail understands that the situation remains 'live and complex' and although City's optimism that an agreement can be struck, issues remain that must be resolved with the Premier League. Lampard's short-term deal at City expires on December 31 and in order for them to ensure that he is not ineligible to play against Sunderland, the club must reach an agreement with New York City FC and ratify the move with the Premier League. It's understood that City are willing to give Lampard a short-term deal until the end of the season, but due to a number of different circumstances it remains unclear how New York City FC would be able to register the move. It is believed that City and New York City came to an agreement to renew Lampard's loan but the length of that deal remains unknown. One suggestion is that he will sign a deal until the end of the season, after which a break clause would allow him to return to New York for the start of the MLS season, should all parties agree to this.

22144,1,"COVID-19, global economic threats, and climate change have drastically slowed economic growth. Global economic activity is expected to slow down to 1.8 percent for 2020, its lowest level since the 2008 global financial crisis. The United Nations predicts a drop of 4 percent in GDP for developing countries, led by declines in trade, travel, and tourism-related activities. As COVID-19 continues to flare up globally and new strains appear, policymakers are preparing fiscal and monetary measures, policy incentives, and support packages to combat the slowdown. However, many have criticized policymakers' responses, which prioritize short-term spending and tax cuts over structural reforms that strengthen the economy. Furthermore, many have noted that fiscal stimulus and monetary stimulus, regardless of the quantity, alone are unlikely to boost the economy significantly. Instead, it is crucial to address the underlying causes of slow economic growth, including issues such as excessive debt,"

13522,2,"The global economy is likely to recover within this year, and the outlook for 2021 is broadly optimistic. Growth prospects will be influenced by the extent to which economic stimulus is deployed across both advanced and emerging countries and the speed with which vaccines are distributed, as well as other policy priorities. Global growth should also be supported by demand increases for commodities as economic activity rebounds, along with increased financial support, notably in advanced economies, where policies are helping to cushion the rise in unemployment caused by the pandemic. Growth prospects are expected to remain strong in 2021 for most parts of the world, with growth rates likely to average above 3% over the year for advanced economies and accelerate to above 4% in emerging markets and developing economies. The pandemic's lasting impact on economic activity suggests that the world economy will be well below its pre-pandemic trend of potential output, which could last through the next two to three years. Although policy support for the global economy remains elevated, the pace and scope of recovery has now improved, prompting both the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to withdraw much of their previous emergency support and to revise up their growth forecasts.

The world economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the coronavirus pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. Global economic growth is slowing down and economic inequalities are rising. The pandemic and its economic fallout has exposed stark economic and racial inequalities and many emerging market economies in East Asia and Latin America are still struggling to bring the public health crisis under control.
Global economic growth is also threatened by rising geopolitical tensions, including the tense US-China relationship and increasing geopolitical risks in Europe and the Middle East. The geopolitical tensions have contributed directly to supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, making it harder for low-income families to afford basic necessities. Governments worldwide are currently responding with fiscal stimulus, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable macroeconomic growth for all citizens.

This has had a knock-on effect on the global economy, affecting the financial markets, employment, and business operations. The health crisis has highlighted economic vulnerabilities and in some ways weakened global interdependence. The economic slowdown has aggravated socioeconomic disparities. Globalized capital and production networks are facing disruptions with increased volatility. Growth in the world economy (GDP) may fall to 3.2% this year, down from 4.0% growth in 2020. According to international forecasts, only eight of the world's 60 or so high-income developed and developing economies will grow this year at or above trend rates. The OECD countries are expected to lag behind with growth of 1.2%. Global growth is expected to rebound next year to 4.4%, but that is less than the 5.5% growth rate in 2018 and 2019.

Answer :

From the context, we can clearly understand that the article and the summary are discussing the global economic situation. The global economic issues come because of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tension and climatic change. Let's understand the economic crises using the following steps:

  The first question that arises is : What is the global economic situation?

Answer :

The global economic situation describes about the current global economic situation. The COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions and climatic change are the core problems for the global economy.

The second question that arises is : What are the responses from different governments?

  The second question describes about what policy and stimulus packages from different governments are being implemented to stabilize the market.

65325,1,"Worldwide impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), coupled with geopolitical tensions and climate change, has contributed to the slowest economic growth in a decade, and will make it challenging to sustain this trend towards post-pandemic recovery. Uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 has exacerbated economic inequalities across income brackets, with low-income families bearing more of these increases. Governments have been implementing measures to support economic activity to cushion the impact of the pandemic and to strengthen recovery. However, the uneven impact of economic downturns, risks of prolonged shutdowns, and the prospect of an increasing number of countries defaulting could trigger widespread uncertainty to financial markets and the global economy. Policymakers are expected to adopt large-scale fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to boost economies.

 The term ""No Man's Land"" refers to the contested territory of the Western Front during World War I between opposing forces of the Great Powers. For more detail, see Wikipedia article on No-man's land.
The No-man's Land is an area in which opposing forces have come in contact, but because of the intensity of the war, the two sides have no inclination to come into direct contact with each other and have stopped their efforts at occupying the areas.

When we summarize information, typically we try to summarize the ""big picture"" in a much less detailed form. This form does not have specific citations. (The first part is from the abstract, the other is from the list of references, where only some of the references are listed.) It gives a simple and concise idea, but it is not as precise as the original article.

The main difference between a summary and a short summary is that the latter only lists important names and their functions, without explaining the background, whereas the former explains the important background.

In addition, a summary often summarizes the ""toplines"" or more general facts. In order to be useful, summaries have to explain in greater detail how these facts fit into the overall story.

Governments have reacted with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth.”

Summary : The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of various risks and shocks. Many of these shocks (the pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change) are of unprecedented origins, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for nations to prepare for and mitigate such shocks. Governments have responded to these challenges with a mix of measures (fiscal, policy, and other) and they are necessary to curb inequalities. The...

The remarks by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs reflected a growing U.S. dissatisfaction with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Suleiman, the intelligence officer Mubarak chose as his deputy to bring about reforms demanded by protesters who have convulsed Cairo and the Egyptian economy for more than two weeks. In another sign of U.S. frustration with the pace of reform in Egypt, Vice President Joe Biden, in a phone call Tuesday with Suleiman, pushed for more progress, according to a White House statement. Biden urged ""that the transition produce immediate, irreversible progress that responds to the aspirations of the Egyptian people,"" according to the White House statement. It said the two vice presidents discussed ""restraining the Ministry of Interior's conduct by immediately ending the arrests, harassment, beating and detention of journalists, and political and civil society activists, and by allowing freedom of assembly and expression; immediately rescinding the emergency law; broadening participation in the national dialogue to include a wide range of opposition members; and inviting the opposition as a partner in jointly developing a road map"

 Which would you go with. The article summary or the plain text.

Thanks. This is a small assignment and I have no idea which way I am leaning, just wondering what are the options.

That is a good question. Is this for class or just you? If you just want some opinions and not necessarily for homework, then I would say do both. The ""who, what, where, when, why and how"" will tell you what the article is about and the ""Plain Text"" will tell you what it is trying to sell you/us. But don't go too far in either direction because either way you'll get the points that they are wanting. Personally I would write something like this in the article summaries:
""  The U.S. economy continued to slow in Q2, but we're not ready for a
recession. The global economy's Q2 performance shows that the
economic recession we predicted a few weeks ago has not happened, yet. The

41667,3,"A global recession looms as countries around the world respond to an oil glut with a sudden flood of new supply, creating the risk of a repeat of a spike in crude prices that forced up interest rates, squeezed consumers and sent shockwaves through financial markets six years ago this week. ``` The first quarter of 2015 is shaping up to be an extension of the worst period of the 2008 global credit crunch, which pushed the world economy into a sharp recession, the International Energy Agency said. The agency predicted output growth will come to a grinding halt, thanks to the worst crash in oil prices in four decades and the prospect of an influx of shale-oil and gas. The new boom in production from shale gas as well as offshore deposits in the U.S. has cut supplies and pushed prices below $20 a barrel, putting heavy pressure on producers and driving others to the wall. ``` The global credit crunch of 2008 and 2009 hit economies as low oil prices forced down energy costs, squeezing consumer spending. U.S. crude prices fell nearly 70 percent from a 2008 peak above $150 a barrel as shale-oil output from new wells in Texas and North Dakota overwhelmed world markets and demand collapsed in response to the global recession.

61130,1,"The argument about the lack of democracy in the South African political system, especially the way in which the governing African National Congress (ANC) runs the country, is a widely-held view. But the most recent local elections have shown that while many people may complain, they actually vote. In the 2019 municipal polls, the ANC won about 54percent of the votes in the Western Cape and about 58percent in the Free State. That means of the 3,000,000 eligible voters, the ANC took in about 2,300,000 (or 73%). The Democratic Alliance (DA), which governs the Western and Southern Cape provinces and is the official opposition nationally, won about 1,500,000 or 16 percent. The EFF (Economic Freedom Fighters), another new party made up primarily of disgruntled former ANC voters, came in 3rd with about 1,000,000 votes, while other smaller parties also did well to make up for the losses suffered by the DA and EFF.

This demonstrates, firstly, that the people of South Africa do not support either the DA or the EFF. Secondly, it shows that people in South Africa are voting for political parties that espouse democracy and other progressive policies, although people may think that these parties are either too radical or are not"

For now, however, prevention and containment are their primary focuses. In Europe, for instance, many nations have reported record-high cases. The WHO has described the coronavirus as a grave threat. The economic impact could be massive, especially for the tourism and hospitality sectors. Also, climate change will affect many of the world`s major nations.

The United States currently has the most COVID-19 cases in the world, with nearly 3 million. Canada, Russia, India, Spain, Brazil, and Italy all have at least 3 million as well. Even smaller nations have reported thousands or even tens of thousands of cases including Singapore, Taiwan, and South Africa. So far, nearly 190 countries have been affected by the virus, with the United States, Canada, and Brazil alone comprising about 41% of the global case count. Most of the countries have at least one case in the single digits and even some nations have recorded single cases in the hundreds. However, since the first week of March, the rates of case and death growth in many nations have shown a drastic increase.

From Asia to Europe and the United States, governments are struggling with rising political risks and threats to democracy. From a slowdown of globalisation and a slowing down of trade, to the spread of political populism to uncertainty about energy security, and technological disruption, many are questioning the resilience of the institutions that have created prosperity and stability across generations. This book explores the underlying causes of today’s challenges, and the reasons why globalisation is here to stay. It sets out to show that while some challenges can be addressed through strong domestic growth strategies, others cannot. Instead, we are left with the need to find ways to manage the global system more effectively, using new tools that are likely to be needed to address ongoing changes in the global system. This book explores these challenges and presents ideas for actions that can be taken both individually and through multilateral means.''

 Article: After a nerve-jangling four days, Arsenal can breathe a little easier. A 3-1 win over West Ham United on Tuesday saw Arsene Wenger's team climb back into the English Premier League's top four, keeping the Gunners in contention to qualify for the lucrative European Champions League. Two goals from Germany's Lukas Podolski and a 20th of the season from Frenchman Olivier Giroud saw Arsenal leapfrog Everton in the table, after Matt Jarvis had given West Ham a shock lead in the first half. The vital victory came just three days after Arsenal had secured a place in the FA Cup final with a dramatic penalty shootout victory over second-tier Wigan Athletic. Two wins in quick succession have boosted Arsenal's hopes of reaching the Champions League for 17th consecutive season,"

Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and strengthening sustainable growth. While the global recovery still appears to be in its early stages, the International Monetary Fund has raised its 2022 growth projections to 6.0% from 4.3%. The IMF does, however, warn that the near-term outlook is highly contingent on the trajectory of the pandemic and the pace of vaccine rollout. While high-income economies, such as the United States, are expected to record double-digit gains this year, low-income and emerging markets will grow only one-fifth as fast. Economic growth may suffer as the world braces for increased geopolitical tensions, including ongoing social unrest in many emerging economies, a potentially contentious 2022 US presidential election, and the threat that climate change poses to global stability.

  In the example of the article, should it continue along the same lines with different bold heading and headings (one for the summary, one for the body copy), or should it be written as one piece of writing? What about paragraphs that are repeated, like the first line in the article?

It doesn't matter as much in this context, where the whole purpose is to be able to share the article with a group of people, so the focus is more on the content than on formatting. I think it does matter in a lot of cases though, especially for more formal pieces that are often meant to be written in an academic journal, or that are meant to be distributed to other people.

I disagree in many cases that it is more about the content and less about formatting. This is especially apparent because in most cases, both the summary and the rest of the copy is copied and pasted verbatim from a template or database.

Article : *''Global trade, tourism, and education hit as economic activity slows''*
Excerpt: *In the last three months of 2011, the US Department of Commerce reported, imports from China dropped by 5.1%, those with Pakistan fell by 4.4%, and those from Japan were 2.4% lower. Total imports from other Asian countries had been growing for four years in a row. And even though those decreases in imports occurred at a time when their economies grew at a healthy pace, the drop still represented a sudden stop of almost $200 billion in consumer goods, the sort of decline that might cause retailers to worry about their future prospects.
Excerpt: *In the three months ending in May 2012 the trade deficit in goods and services from Europe (France, Greece, Italy, and Spain) fell dramatically. In fact, it was down to the point where the gap was not much different from the US surplus. Exports in volume terms from the EU as a group were still higher than in the prior year, but by a smaller percentage. In other words, exports of French wines and cheeses didn't have as much of a market as they once did."

86152,0,"The economic fallout from COVID-19 is forcing businesses to look to become more competitive through digitalisation and automation, with the knock-on effect of increasing job uncertainty and income instability. The impact of pandemics has also brought an end to some jobs, while workers with higher skills and higher-paying positions have been more likely to keep their jobs'.`

 The plain-text summary sentence with URLs and lists is :  ```The global workforce has been negatively impacted by the pandemic and the ensuing recession, with a number of sectors adversely affected and a corresponding rise in unemployment. The crisis is forcing businesses to implement digitalisation and automation at a rapid pace, which will create a new wave of demand for workers possessing digital skills, but more importantly, drive competition amongst companies for the best of those workers'.`

So, what does this tell us?

The first thing that jumps out at us is the disparity between the plain-text version and the link, or URLs, of the summary.

But many in Greece's business community question the figure, suggesting the country is about to slip into a long-term depression, with no end in sight.
```Greece's economy is expected to shrink by a far more than previously estimated 7%, and it's expected to grow just 0.1% next year.
This makes it the worst-performing economy in the eurozone.

If you are trying to check the value of the page on B for every hit on A, try using the GET method http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GET

Your method GET (the HTML entity) sends exactly one HTTP request. In other words, it only sends ""one shot"" at each page. (You could also do a followup GET for each error,"

Rising debt levels, government spending hikes, and the looming impact of climate change all threaten to derail the world economy. The US Federal Reserve has already slashed interest rates by 150 basis points, leaving the door open to further cuts to encourage the world's largest economy to stimulate consumption. The Bank of England and the Bank of Japan are expected to follow suit. These rate cuts will be accompanied by bond-buying programmes aimed at bolstering financial markets. This week the US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates to near zero and launch another massive bond-buying programme in an effort to support confidence. However, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan are expected to leave their interest rates unchanged.

56765,3,"The global economy has suffered an unprecedented drop in economic output and is expected to plummet even further in the current quarter as a result of both the global COVID-19 pandemic and the combined impact of geopolitical tensions and climate change. In response, governments around the world have responded with a mix of fiscal and monetary stimulus measures and policies aimed at reining in the effects of the pandemic on businesses and household consumption. On March 18, the G20 nations pledged to address the impact of the pandemic through fiscal and monetary policy and announced a $5 trillion stimulus package. Although this effort could slow the economic effects of the pandemic, it is unlikely to prevent the contraction from turning into a depression in the second quarter of 2020. Furthermore, these fiscal and monetary measures are expected to create further strain on both fiscal and monetary budgets, further reducing the probability of a robust recovery by year-end.``

The goal of this example is to:

a) make it easy to read.
b) to keep the content on the ""simple"" level.
c) to keep each title as short as possible.

The summary should contain only the main points of the main article, that is not the part of the title. Do not use more than two or three sentences for this.

2) The main title should be an exact match to the main article and it should consist of one word, no more and no less.

The main title should consist of one word exactly as the main body of the article, and it should not be truncated.

3) The title should be formatted :
Title|Summary(s)|Article|Content Body
with no hyphens and no underscores.

A good alternative would be

92116,2,"Global economic challenges, the result of climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, have combined to slow economic growth, especially in developing countries. Fiscal stimuli and policy reforms are being deployed as the IMF forecasts a 4.2 percent contraction in 2020 and a modest rebound in 2021, with most advanced and emerging economies in recession. The IMF says that, while the global recession won’t be as severe as some may have feared, it has been much longer and more widespread, and is more adverse than most anticipated. The pandemic itself appears to have been the main shock, with economic output contracting more in the first three months of 2020 than in any single quarter in the previous decade. The IMF’s projections show a recovery starting in the second half of 2021, but growth next year may still be 1.2 percent lower than in 2019. Global growth is forecast to reach 4.1 percent in 2022, the strongest since 2011 and 3.4 percent in 2023, well below the 5.8 percent in 2018.

So... does that mean plain-text is a better way of summarising an article than hyperlinks? I would find that very difficult to manage...
I would also find a hard time choosing a plain-text summaries that matches the one I would have written. For example, ""economic growth slowed both developed and developing nations. The latter suffered more.""... Well, I would expect to be more specific about that...

72354,1,"The global economy and climate change are facing unprecedented challenges as the combined impact of COVID-19, geopolitical tensions, and climate change is making it difficult to sustain growth. This has led to slower growth and supply-chain issues which have made basic needs harder for families. For many people the current economic uncertainty is making it harder to pay rent or cover bills. A global recession is on the horizon if we don’t take immediate action to address climate change. This has already had a huge effect on oil prices, the value of the euro is slipping, and the U.S. dollar is strengthening. Governments can help by implementing policies that make it easier for families to get by in the short term. Governments can do this through stimulus packages for struggling industries and lower taxes on the poor and middle classes. A recovery requires a collective effort that involves all nations, but in particular must focus on low carbon technologies. In order to be successful these plans must also include adequate safety nets for families, especially those living with disabilities or mental illnesses who may be suffering disproportionately from the pandemic. This is why we need leadership on climate from the U.S.A. and a strong plan from Canada to address both climate change and the financial fallout from the virus. Given these challenges,"

A jury found that Chung Kim fatally shot his neighbor Michelle Jackson, 31, on February 4, as she stood on her balcony above his apartment. He then went upstairs to her residence and shot and killed her boyfriend, Jamie Stafford, 31. The couple's dog would relieve itself on their balcony, causing the urine and feces to drip down Kim's balcony each time they washed it, according to court records. Kim claimed the couple had 'intentionally thrown dog feces' on his porch. 'That’s all come down from my patio, from up patio. But now, three months later so stink,' he told CBS from jail. He also said that the shooting of Stafford was in self-defense but that he could not remember shooting Jackson because he suffered a blackout. Kim faces an automatic life sentence in prison without parole. Just months before their death, Jackson and Stafford had their first child together. Jackson also had four children aged 7 to 11 from a previous partner. The baby now lives with Jackson's parents and the four children live with their father in Garland, Texas."

48417,1,"The global economic system is under threat due to geopolitical tensions, climate change, and the current effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of global warming, especially in regards to water availability, has been an ongoing debate as to whether it will actually have a negative effect on food security. However, there have been many reports over the last 20 years stating climate change to be a major threat to the availability of food, but these predictions have generally failed. In fact, recent research shows that global warming has had a positive effect on food production, particularly in tropical areas, and climate change has led to drought in Australia, which resulted in record production of wheat in the last two years. The current debate seems to be over the long-term effect of climate change on water shortages, while the short term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have already demonstrated that the global economy can come to a temporary halt. So, what can we realistically expect over the next 10–30 years? It is clear that the global economy as it is now, will never truly recover as there will always be a significant amount of damage to the international community. There will obviously be a period of time where growth will continue to stagnate, however, this time around there are other factors"

As the public debate around climate change intensifies, the environmental and social costs of consumption are becoming more clearly understood. Policymakers and the public need to recognize the risks associated with excessive consumption.

How is this the same as the above?  It does not talk about supply chain disruption, inflationary pressures, or economic inequalities.  In fact, this summary has none of those things--it talks about challenges in the form of a single sentence (which does not match with the article above).

Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth. But with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the concurrent decline in economic activity, the immediate challenge is to limit the damage, stabilize output, and minimize bankruptcies and job losses. The longer-term challenge is to make recovery as swift as possible. Many of the support packages to keep markets going through the disruption will in the end become fiscal deficits as governments support businesses and households for longer than had been envisaged initially. In the developed world, this expansionist policy response brings with it rising indebtedness, and inflation. In developing economies, the current demand depression means that domestic demand, which accounted for much of the growth in recent decades, is unlikely to return quickly even if monetary policy eases, and in some, such as the Indian economy, fiscal expansion has been even more accommodative still.

The US claim:
As explained above the main arguments presented by Washington regarding the possible deployment of the cruise missile by Russia appear as follows:

""The New START treaty limits Russian missiles, except for ballistic missiles. In other words, Russia has the equivalent of 1,550 nuclear warheads, but, it doesn't have 1,550 long-range nuclear missiles.

Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are exacerbating economic inequalities, making it harder for low-income families to afford basic necessities. Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth.

As global governments implement measures to mitigate the effects of the global pandemic, economic recovery in the short term is unlikely to be strong, with growth possibly remaining subdued through at least 2023 as a result of supply shocks and fiscal and monetary stimulus. However, a return to growth will likely require the global community to tackle both COVID-19 and climate change simultaneously and on a large scale. In this article,"
54942,3,"'' `The global economy is struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of reduced global demand, supply chain disruptions, and inflationary pressures, leading to a sharp slowdown in economic growth. Even as governments worldwide are responding to reduce the COVID-19 risk and foster overall economic recovery, political controversies and rising tensions are preventing governments from unifying public support for their policies, making it harder for economies to sustainably recover. The latest round of US-China tensions have pushed up inflationary pressures in both the developed and emerging economies, leading to accelerating inflation and higher interest rates. In addition, regional conflicts have disrupted the economies of many developing nations, causing considerable economic disruption and hindering inclusive economic growth. Many policymakers are concerned that these factors could threaten the stability of financial markets, destabilizing the global markets, while hampering recovery from the pandemic. To avert this risk, many governments are turning to fiscal stimulus and investment. However, these stimulus measures are expected to push up levels of government debt. Some governments, including Japan, are adopting unorthodox policies such as the ‘Abenomics' to address the rising debt levels while pursuing measures to sustain growth and financial stability.''

In the past, the United States government focused on reducing the federal budget deficit during this fiscal year. Now, given the national health crisis, the United States government needs to find a way to spend money on infrastructure.

We have only one sentence, but this is considered a more readable summary of a 2 page article.

You could also use this idea to summarise longer articles or create more detailed bullet-points while summarising:

```The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of climate change, geopolitical tensions, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Government policies are being implemented across the world to address these challenges.

Sustainable growth is becoming a necessity.''

There are many different ways you could take this paragraph.

One way would be to create two summary sentences for both the long article and short summary:

The text which is supposed to be in HTML is:

Summary

 > The global economy is struggling since the first quarter of 2020 due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change, resulting in lower economic growth, higher inflation, longer-term unemployment and reduced global savings rate. Although in the early stages, the recovery is likely to be very uneven, with growth in major OECD nations likely to rebound, while economic recovery in developing countries will remain very weak. Inflation pressures have risen in major economies and are expected to persist at least until late 2021 and in some cases beyond that. Faced with these developments and a continued low-interest rate environment, central banks will likely continue to lower interest rates; some central banks in advanced economies are even considering negative interest rates.

These stunning images show what must surely be one of the world's most unpleasant jobs - mining for sulphur on the side of a volcano in Indonesia. Locals near the Ijen volcano complex risk their lives to get their hands on the foul-smelling mineral, and are usually paid just a few pounds a day.

However, the IMF, the World Bank and other major international organizations subsequently downgraded their growth forecasts for 2013, with the IMF predicting growth would slow to 3 per cent. However, the World Bank noted that the global pace of economic development remains high. Furthermore, while the advanced economies, including the United States, continue to grow at a modest pace, emerging and developing economies are still seeing growth rates rise faster than in the past. In 2011, the IMF projected global gross domestic product (GDP) would expand by 3.1 per cent in 2012, and an estimated 3.8 per cent in 2013. In the first quarter of 2013, the world economy grew by 0.7 per cent, up slightly from the 0.6 per cent year-over-year increase in 2012.

SOUTHAMPTON, England – The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, political tensions, and climate change, and economic growth has slowed considerably across both developed and developing nations, the International Monetary Fund said Thursday.
The fund's outlook for the global economy remains highly uncertain, with risks tilted to the downside in the near term as the course of the pandemic remains highly uncertain.
""Despite recent encouraging and surprising progress on vaccinations, the virus is still spreading at an alarming rate,"" the Washington-based lender said. The IMF also noted that growth has been uneven across regions as several high-income countries have been recovering from the pandemic sooner than developing and advanced world economies like China, India, Chile, Mexico, and Egypt.
""In light of the new and highly contagious variants, the downside risks have increased,” the fund said.
In the United States, the fund expects growth to remain positive in the short term, at least, with fiscal and monetary policy support intact."

I am having trouble grasping what the question is, but if you are looking for a comparison for that type of summary, then it is exactly what I would write in 20 words or less. I don't recommend using a sentence from Wikipedia (as the article is written in the style of an ""introduction"" to an article on Wikipedia), but Wikipedia, for all its failings, is definitely a good starting point.

The problem that I'm having is that it doesn't really have a topic. The sentence seems to be a summary of the ""global economy."" That is definitely the type of thing that I'm looking for.  However, the rest of the summary isn't very well-aligned with the opening sentence, so I'm having trouble forming a cohesive topic.

What information would you require here as a summary?

A good solution for this might be to let users define how text should be summarized, as opposed to the approach taken on this landing page.
A user might type a summary that would look something like:

Summary : ""The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change....""

If you have an article that is about the weather, the weather as it pertains to an event, like a storm or a blizzard, use the keyword extraction filter. The filter is made to extract keywords with weather terms.

Note that we do not get too specific with weather terms. We will use the most general term and the keyword can consist of any of the following words: snow, rain, hail, frost, snowflakes, ice, wind, sun, sunshine, cloud, fog.

The search phrase can also be:

This is a paraphrase of the full article but I don’t include the links - what’s the use of using the links anyway? - and it means that if something in the article has a link, the search engines cannot match the URL to the actual article (a bit like making your article about a different topic but then including the URL in the article as a footnote to a quote - which is a terrible idea because the footnote will not be indexed).

  So, it is not necessary to use the full text for any search engine to link to the complete article (though that should not be done for articles having original content). One could also say that the summaries are not searchable, which does not appear to be true either - at least not for plain-text searches where links, lists etc are used. If summaries are not searchable, how are they presented to the users?

 I think it'd look better as:
[the global economy is struggling due to COVID-19, geopolitical tensions, and climate change...leading to slower growth, [...] government supports in...](

I think this really depends on your particular audience; if you have your own opinion about that it certainly wouldn't hurt if you made it clear. Maybe add ""I think it would look better"" right after ""I think.""
For instance, you say that you think they should use a plain statement before the summaries, because that provides context. If they're interested in the context, they can always go to the source. However, it's completely different if they're only interested in the summaries. In that situation, you're removing the context from the summaries, and that means you're giving away the meat of your article. In fact, it could be construed as an insult if you imply that they should've read your other articles first - after all, you created the summaries, so they should probably read them first!"

This exercise helps people come up with more effective summaries using language which is easy to read quickly. In contrast to articles, summaries don&#x27;t really need footnoted sources.

The goal is not to ensure security by keeping out all threats to the economic growth. The Global network thrives based on the principles of free enterprise. Free markets are generally based on a foundation of free trade in all sectors and the use of legal instruments called trade agreements.
The following three rules serve as the pillars of the free trade/free enterprise network:

a) There should be no government interference into the economic life of the nation-state.
The free market and free trade is an economic and political term and a social ideology. It does not have a material or objective basis. Its purpose is to ensure and facilitate the expansion of free trade and economic prosperity. The concept of a free market was first conceptualized by the French economist Auguste Comte in 1796. He used the term for his concept of socialism/communism as a critique of his political opponents and as a strategy to promote the expansion of commerce and trade among the European states.[1][2][3][4][5]

While the use of the informant was discussed by the police, the matter has not been sufficiently addressed by the court that has convicted all 18 defendants. For example, the sentencing guidelines require judges to consider:

 whether the defendant posed an unacceptable risk to the public of a serious risk of injury to members of the public or of damaging property, etc.
 the nature of the offence(s) committed
 the harm or damage caused to the victims.

In practice, the offence in question is often the grooming of young girls which is sexual exploitation: sexual exploitation of children may also involve the possession of photos or videos, or sexual assault including rape. The court must consider whether the person convicted of grooming young girls - and any other young person or older person, also if the defendant has been convicted or cautioned for child sex offences -"

The L.A. Times, however, said that he followed her out of her office and stood outside, with his fists clenched, “an inch away from [her] face,” then made a gesture of a clenched fist on his forehead, with his left hand extended toward her.

31269,3,"Global Challenges to Growth and Jobs During a Pandemic
by Steven F. Davis, Jr., Professor of Economics, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina
Abstract
In this paper, I examine the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy. Using two different models I estimate the impact of the pandemic on economic growth and on jobs for the coming decade. I then use the resulting long-run forecast to estimate the long-run impact of the pandemic on economic inequality across countries. I use these long-run estimates to study the economic recovery of different countries and the potential for the global stock of debt to double by 2060.

However, it is too early to assess the longer-term consequences and how these policy responses might change the global economic landscape. The pandemic has caused a substantial increase in fiscal deficits; however, some emerging economies are experiencing growing external debt problems as a result, while the ongoing crisis is further hindering the fiscal position of other economies. In the aftermath of the 2009 global financial crisis, many advanced economies struggled to exit from unconventional easing.

The government’s Committee on Climate Change has called for a carbon allowance to ensure businesses, households and industries have the certainty to plan.

It proposes a range of policies from expanding renewable energy to help cut greenhouse gas emissions, to improving energy efficiency and retro-fitting new housing to reduce demand on services.''

Ahmed Hassan, 26, from Hounslow, south-west London, is accused of preparing to conduct a ""terrorist act"" between 1 April 2017 and 1 July that year, the Old Bailey heard today.

The prosecution alleges he was motivated by support or sympathy for the ""Islamic State of Iraq"" (ISIS), and wanted to carry out a terror attack in the UK, by suicide-bombing, mass-casualty knife-attack or ""otherwise causing widespread death and destruction"".
Mr Hassan is accused of possessing a terrorist manual including ""How to make a bomb in the kitchen of your mother"".

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised downwards its projections for world GDP growth to -3.4 percent in 2020, with a rebound in 2021 to 5.8 percent. The pandemic is already causing a huge contraction in business activity, industrial production and trade. Unemployment and poverty are likely to increase significantly in the short term. However, fiscal and monetary stimulus measures are helping to protect families and secure income, and, at the same time, governments are making important health investments in testing and treatment. The stimulus measures implemented in some countries may be insufficient, but they are supporting the economy. The recovery is also expected to be weaker than was initially anticipated. The IMF expects world GDP to expand by 3.0 percent in 2021. This new outlook indicates that an economic recovery has already begun. However, it is likely to be a much"

The global community must use all policy tools to address the twin challenges of growth slowdown and rising inequality. Global leaders must work together to develop a long-term strategy to address the multiple crises. Global growth appears to be slowing down amid the crisis. The recent resurgence in COVID-19 cases in the UK and US indicate that a further resurgence in cases can easily send growth negative, even without additional policy actions. If policymakers respond by reinstating containment measures we can expect a return to the double-dip recession of the 1970s. Weakening growth, however, is far from the end of the world. The crisis will present a tremendous opportunity as we reorient our economy toward a more sustainable and inclusive model.```

56482,2,"The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on developing economies hit by geopolitical tensions and increasing climate change has brought the world closer to a 'global economic crash' according to research by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).
The financial institution, which is one of the world´s central banks, warned that the financial fallout may be far more severe than the financial crisis. In a stark warning that inflation is likely to jump rapidly in the next few months, as a result of the global economic shutdown caused by the pandemic, the BIS said that the global recovery faces two critical risks: the collapse in demand if health crises don´t go away and the emergence of inflation in the financial system.
“As economic activity recovers from the pandemic, we expect inflation to rise rapidly. Much may depend on the path of the virus, and therefore that forecast is, to put it mildly, extremely uncertain,” the BIS said in the report.
The organization also underlined concerns that demand will be depressed until a vaccine is found, and in the meantime governments must be careful not to withdraw measures too early.

 Which of these sentences from the paragraph above should be kept?  A. ```Globalization has faced a setback over the past year due to economic uncertainty and increased trade tensions.`\"" B. ```Globalization has had a setback over the past year due to economic uncertainty and increased trade tensions.`\"" C. ```Globalization faced a setback last year due to economic uncertainty and trade tensions.`\"" D. ```Financialization faced a setback last year due to financial uncertainty and increased global trade tensions.`\"" E.

The correct choice B) because the sentence is logically dependent on the preceding ones in the paragraph to be meaningful, is only true when the sentence is logically independent. It makes no sense to say if something had been the case it is the same as something continuing to be the case which means it is logically dependent.

Question: Given that we're given only a summary, can i use the summary for the article as my main text?

I apologize as I am not quite sure what we mean by ""summary"" in this instance.

What happens if someone goes to a website and reads only one sentence (the summary of the article) - is that fine for them to do?

If we mean the full text, as well as the summaries that are shown on the websites, then yes, that should be alright. But we are talking about the shortened version (the'summary') so that is the text that will be shown. The article with the full text will follow soon after. If it is an academic assignment, then the article with the full text will always be preferred.

The report, released by the World Bank and Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative, is the latest to put a more optimistic tone on the state of global poverty. While the report's authors note that progress towards reducing poverty remains slow and uneven, the findings are less damning than many had feared, largely down to improvements in economic growth in East and Southern Asia, home to over half the world's poor. Despite the findings that global poverty dropped by 2.4% between 2018 and 2019, the researchers also highlighted many concerning figures, including the fact that there are more than 1 billion still living in extreme poverty, particularly in Africa, Asia and the least developed parts of Europe and North America. ""Poverty-reduction rates are still too slow. At the current pace, it will take us another 29 years to reach the ambitious target of eliminating absolute poverty,"" the authors wrote in a section of the report called ""Looking Inward"", referring to the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of reducing to zero all forms of poverty.

The response to the crisis was complex and took longer than many expected. Global governments are now balancing a policy of growth, with maintaining economic stability and improving welfare.  Government fiscal stimulus has varied dramatically, and been supplemented by the monetary measures of the major monetary institutions.  Global growth has slowed considerably; global growth slowed to 2.3% in 2020, compared to 3.1% in 2019.  In addition, some large countries grew less, some developed countries grew more slowly, and there were marked differences in growth across developing and developing countries, which is a concern.  There are further constraints on growth; the COVID-19 pandemic has put many people out of work, as well as businesses; it has also disrupted supply chains and created economic insecurity.  Governments have responded to all of these factors at the same time, and to many of the challenges in a range of different ways. The result has been some growth, but not the sustained, robust growth that was needed to counter the growing inequalities of the past five decades.

61933,1,"This paper analyzes the effects of the Great Recession on income inequality in the United States, using administrative data from the IRS. Contrary to popular wisdom, it finds no evidence that the Great Recession reduced inequality, nor that the recovery has reversed the rise in inequality since 1980. As a counterargument, we document the long-term trend in the growth of wage inequality, as well as the increase in inequality after 1980 and the rise in inequality after the financial crisis and again after the Great Recession. We then introduce a new measure of inequality called the ""inheritance penalty"" that measures the size of the gap between the cumulative distributions of labor compensation and the net wealth of the richest one percent (by net wealth), relative to the cumulative distributions of labor compensation and net wealth of the bottom 99 percent.

Article Summary

    The global economy is slowing, with the consequences felt on an unprecedented scale. The combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change are destabilizing the global economic system, in turn affecting every region in the world. With the World Bank estimating that the effects of climate change could bring about a global loss of up to 8%, the potential for disaster has never been greater. To mitigate these effects, governments worldwide are responding with a variety of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and other support packages.

The world's leaders need to prioritize three goals in responding to these threats. First, they must keep the COVID-19 pandemic under control, prevent a resurgence of the virus, and support affected people, companies, and sectors. Second, they must"

 Article: By Andrew Osborn. PUBLISHED:. 16:55 EST, 15 March 2013. |. UPDATED:. 19:52 EST, 15 March 2013. Comics actor Eddie Murphy has been cleared of a long-standing rape allegation. A Los Angeles County jury found the Beverly Hills Cop star not guilty of the alleged crime last Thursday. In 1999 the actor sued one of his former porn star partners, Lisa Raymond, who alleged that Murphy raped her after making a cameo appearance in her adult film, Private Zone. But the jury decided that the incident was consensual and did not meet the legal definition of rape under California law – which at the time had not been amended to include vaginal penetration. The verdict has been criticised as another example of the abuse of the #MeToo campaign."

The same text would be acceptable in either version. There needs to be the most detailed explanation. The summary would need to be very condensed but a couple of paragraphs would suffice explaining exactly how these three problems inter link, the impact and how governments are responding to them etc. The author could also insert some additional content on who he or she is, that the summary is in their capacity as a journalist at a specific publication.

I have to clarify that this is the only requirement."

Bill Paterson denies all the charges against him and has lodged two special defences of alibi and incrimination.
The trial is taking place at the High Court in Glasgow.

Heather Mills (née Campbell) was on trial for defamation in the High Court of England and Wales after she published part of a personal letter in which Tiger Woods talked about his affairs.
Heather Mills had received a letter from Tiger Woods admitting to an extramarital affair.
She said that because she had not revealed the true source of the letter (Woods himself) she was defaming him, since she was only publishing part of the personal letter.
The full text of the letter was eventually printed in The Daily Mail.
The trial concluded with the judge announcing the verdict in the case, which was ""that the defendant's assertion that the article published by her on 29th March 2011 contained defamatory matter did amount to defamation.""

The  <b>Summary</b>  element allows you to summarize information in an article, thus allowing users more or less important content to fit into the width of their browser window.

This example above summarizes a basic web document on Venezuela’s electricity problems as published by Reuters.

  This can also be formatted using h5, h6, h7, or h8 elements. These styles provide more flexibility by allowing you to customize content based on the number of words, words per line, or length of the lines.

  As this example shows, short articles may require a shorter summary as well as more compact and readable content.

  For example, a three to four-word summary of the summary may be less necessary when a basic summary contains as many words as the article. However, in more complex documents such as news articles, longer summaries may be the best approach.

China and the Obama administration are sparring over U.S. efforts to gain wider access to Chinese exports and over growing protectionism in China's foreign market, with little sign of any compromise. As China prepares to mark the 40th anniversary of its reform and open economy policy, the U.S. said it would send a delegation to Hong Kong for a ""bilateral dialogue"" with the government but Washington is widely expected to leave in October. That could leave President Barack Obama vulnerable to allegations of not having sufficiently defended U.S. interests in the world's second largest economy and as tensions between the two countries persist. ""This is potentially a very dangerous time -- a dangerous, dangerous time for our interests. I think the trade relationship"

This is a perfect example of SEO and how to make your article ""search engine friendly"".
You do exactly what you'd like your readers to do.
They have to follow a link to the article because you want your readers to read it.

I don't see why the example is so terrible. It's a fact that Google wants to understand your visitors better so it can give them a more relevant result in search. If the summary is relevant to search, then there is no ""misleading SEO"" involved.

The article could be a lot shorter, and the writing could be a lot better, too.

What do you mean, is there an unneeded word at the end? Is there something that could have been deleted or something like that. I just copied the link from Google News and used it for this example so that I wouldn't create an entire post and it would fit on my ""One post per item of the day"" rule.

These reports are generally written from the perspective of a reporter -- not a specialist in that subject.

As an aside, the summary is also written in a ""very brief"" and ""very basic"" style as a rule that does not always please the publisher, especially when the text is too detailed. The most common style is a ``very brief summaries'' style. The publisher and his editorial team then get to ""improve"""

  Article with an AP style reference ```Global Economy Faces Unprecedented Challenges Due to COVID-19, Geopolitical Tensions, and Climate Change'.`

  Summary in plain text who: the global economy; whose actions; what: actions of governments; when: pandemic; where: to the developing nations; what: to the developing nations; why: political tensions; climate changes; how: to the pandemic.

The articles is written as though the world we are talking about has been here many times.  Why doesn't the author include some of the more recent news items about the challenges the economy faces.  For example, what about the collapse of the Eurozone and the Greek economy.  As we get closer to the November election I expect the news to get a little worse.
This is an example of why I have always liked AP Style as opposed to Chicago Style.  It puts the focus on the content instead of on the details of the style.

There is a lot of news about the global economy going to be presented in November."

Instead, they were handed the same old story, with the All Blacks extending their streak with a 35-17 win at Bordeaux-Begles. The Wallabies scored three tries, while the All Blacks crossed for 28, with the only difference being that this time they were able to put points on the board after conceding first. Australia had been expected to play an out-and-out physical game against a team they were confident of seeing off, but the All Blacks were happy to keep the scoreboard ticking over for the opening 30 minutes in the absence of their injured talisman Beauden Barrett. Australia had a good kick chase in the opening minutes, denying the home side a try in the process, but they were unable to get any penetration. The Wallabies made the breakthrough right at the end of the quarter when they broke out from the scrum in their 22, with captain Michael Hooper crossing in the corner. Wallaby Jack Dempsey’s conversion was successful, and gave his team the lead. New Zealand’s first try came in the second quarter via Sevu Reece, who crashed over from a lineout.

Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimulus, policy reforms and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth. The IMF recently estimated that the global economy will contract by 3 percent in 2020 but bounce back in 2021, and that the growth would be slower for the rest of the decade without the stimulus. The virus has caused serious harm to both developed and developing economies, with many smaller and midsized firms and workers suffering a much sharper economic shock than larger and better insulated enterprises. The pandemic has also sparked social and political upheavals in many places all around the world as people struggle for survival. As the global economy recovers, policymakers will have to be extra-vigilant against the rising risk of a new financial crisis and other risks such as the growing environmental and humanitarian impacts of climate change.```

The global economy is struggling due to COVID-19, geopolitical tensions, and climate change, leading to slower growth, supply chain issues, and increased inequality.
Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth.
Many companies and governments are facing a significant liquidity crisis as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact on their economies is likely to be significant, long lasting, and global in nature.

Governments are responding by providing substantial support measures, but these measures are insufficient given the scale of the economic downturn. FISCAL POLICY, REFORMS, AND SUPPORT PACKAGES

Governments in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, and France were quick to announce fiscal and other support measures in March 2020 in order to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

These include increases in fiscal expenditure, tax cuts and subsidies, and various support measures aimed at supporting micro, small, and medium enterprises and protecting jobs. Furthermore, governments have been able to use “unprecedented” and “unprecedented scale” to counter the COVID"

 Textual Summary

A key feature of the text used by Wikinewz is to include plain text summaries at the bottom of articles. This is done by the tool automatically at the beginning and end of a page. Plain summaries make it easy to see the main points or the main argument in an argumentative piece of text. They also provide another angle of reading an article. However while plain summaries show the main point and key argument of an article many times they do not often give an explicit analysis or understanding of the main argument - for example they may not discuss the main problem or point of disagreement or outline the evidence that backs up the main claim. They also give very little attention to a text s structure or tone of presentation.

 Articles on Wikinews often contain a single claim and thus are often very short, and in the case of opinion pieces this is often the focus. Often these articles are presented as opinion pieces because they"

Given these challenges, the global economy has deteriorated on almost all fronts:

Fiscal stimulus, policy reforms, and support packages remain minimal
Global growth remains weak (down 0.5 percentage points)
Inflationary pressures are intensifying (up 0.7 percentage points)
Inflation expectations remain high (up 0.5 percentage points)
Trade and investment have weakened substantially
Global manufacturing production is below the long-run average
Emergencies have been increasing across the world due to the virus (at least 1 every 8 minutes)
Risks to global growth remain tilted to the downside, despite progress in the battle against COVID-19
Policy uncertainties in the US, China, and Europe remain
Climate change remains a major vulnerability
To summarize, the global economy has seen a massive deterioration in economic conditions and the global outlook remains extremely uncertain. This deterioration in the global economy could continue until mid-2022 before showing signs of improvement''

Article: Are Manchester United right to sack David Moyes? As David Moyes¿s reign unravelled on Monday, tales emerged of senior Manchester United¿ players beating a path to the door of Sir Alex Ferguson¿s Cheshire home to urge their old manager to push for change. The message was clear: they no longer stood by Moyes and neither should United if the empire Ferguson built was not going to continue crumbling, brick by brick. There"
44634,2,"Article: Are Manchester United right to sack David Moyes? As David Moyes continued his campaign to convince the press and supporters he would be able to do better than the man who succeeded him at Old Trafford, the Manchester United board were plotting his downfall. David Moyes made a poor fist of replacing the Red Devils' legend and was sacked on Tuesday. But can Louis van Gaal, the man charged with restoring the fallen giants to their former glories, succeed where Moyes failed?. The board's decision comes on the back of the season that started so well and then descended into awfulness. Moyes was given the job by Ed Woodward in a bid to restore the club's fortunes. The Red Devils, having missed out on Champions League football the season before, came close to winning it only to end up as one of the lowest-finishing teams following their worst ever season in the Premier League. Despite a respectable sixth place finish to that campaign, it looks like the former Everton boss is not capable of leading United to any kind of glory. After all, it was Ferguson who had put Moyes down a route that involved a move to Old Trafford. He'd worked closely with the Scot in recent years as he'd tried to steer Everton out of the"

After all, the club went unbeaten in pre-season, he was a champion in his homeland, and had brought in players who were supposed to help him restore an old and glorious reputation. The former Everton, West Ham and Real Sociedad boss, the chosen successor to “The Chosen One,” was the new kid on the block who was supposed to learn on the job, take some time to adapt, and then start winning. In the end, he lasted less than a season and 11 games in charge of the club he knew and loved. The club, meanwhile, is still flogged with the same old excuses: The club"

The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges as a result of COVID-19, climate change, geopolitical tensions, as well as heightened competition in an increasingly globalized marketplace, according to a new report published by the McKinsey Global Institute.
The firm, which produces a series of research reports on topics of economic and societal significance, has predicted that the COVID-19 pandemic will leave an indelible imprint on business education beyond the current health crisis.
It's not just a single class that professors, administrators, alumni and students are likely to have more difficulty teaching in the future, the firm said. Rather, ""the rapid move online over the last year and a half has underscored the inherent flexibility of business education"", McKinsey said.
Over the same period, McKinsey also said, the global economic landscape has become more ""intrenched"", putting intense competition on businesses, as the world increasingly becomes intertwined.

65855,1,"The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. GDP growth in 2020 is likely to slow to its lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis, with many countries facing double-digit contractions in output. Furthermore, while the outlook does look somewhat better in the second half, in advanced economies the underlying trend is towards continuing economic sluggishness. There is also increased risk of a deep economic downturn in some emerging and developing economies, with output and commodity prices expected to decline significantly. The pandemic, with lockdowns affecting almost half the world, is pushing countries to take emergency measures such as fiscal stimulus. Most of the policy responses are in a mix of direct, monetary and macro-prudential measures. The scale of government intervention has reached historic proportions compared with the past year, with fiscal packages expected to reach US$11.5 trillion this year. However, the fiscal space available to all countries is limited given already high debt levels and high government spending as a share of GDP. The recovery may also be interrupted if the virus flares up again before economies can re-open.

As the global economic recovery begins, the international community is increasingly concerned about the potential for large-scale debt distress. Developing countries in particular have been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. This has led many to draw on existing debt relief initiatives, but with limited success as advanced economies have continued to withhold financial support. For low-income countries, already struggling with debt, the recovery threatens to stall.

Policy solutions alone cannot adequately address the growing debt burden. This will require a renewed cooperative effort from the international community.

Bars and restaurants are closing, schools have stopped in-person teaching, and large gatherings have been cancelled. So far, Americans are making the decision to quarantine themselves not by panic and threats, but in an informed way, as a way to contribute. to slowing the spread of the virus. That means that right now, there is no need for an emergency stimulus package. The Federal. government has the tools to slow the damage to the economy, and it is using them – the emergency lending facilities. to lend to businesses to help them pay their payroll.

Some countries are in danger of not being able to continue borrowing and are at risk of default.  The pandemic could even lead to world war 3. Economic recovery measures will be costly and ineffective,  since the damage on the global economy has already been done.  The government will therefore have to spend a large sum of money to fix things,"
98766,2,"Environmental sensitivity is rising in popularity among human consumers, but interest in eco-sensitive burial is increasing even faster. Cremation, as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional burials, is on the rise because of the financial recession; more green-minded families are choosing to save money and the planet by having ashes interred in eco-friendly sites and not in cement vaults. The benefits of cremation include lower environmental impact and the ability to reuse or recycle the ashes, although some critics argue that recycling is just a way for funeral homes to profit from the practice. In the U.S., about 90 percent of human remains are buried in landfills, and even if those bodies could be reused for fertilizer, other environmental challenges remain.```

I don't know if I've watched too many scary movies lately, but I've been pondering natural burial alternatives for dearly departed pets."
98766,3,"When your beloved pet dies, you probably don't want to fork over the cash to get them a traditional funeral. Instead you may be considering natural burial, in which your pet is buried in a simple plot, surrounded by natural woodlands and flowers. But if your pet has gone too long without the usual rites of passage, like a wake or a viewing, you may be stuck with those traditional services. No worries! There's an alternative: artificial insemination. If your pets have produced litters, most will be euthanized as they get old, and that means you don't have to make the tough decision of burying them or putting them down. Artificial insemination isn't perfect, though, and there are drawbacks to it. `''

However, there are signs that the economic consequences could be worse, with a number of countries facing a deep crisis. China is facing the worst impact, with its GDP forecast to contract by 8% in 2020 - the first contraction since 1992, which was the height of the Asian financial crisis. Other major economies will suffer varying levels of disruption, with the US recession deepening but the contraction in Europe moderate. Small island nations will be particularly hard hit by oil demand collapsing. There are also major structural problems to solve, such as the long-term impact of coronavirus and the challenge of climate change on fragile states.```

I am not sure how I would write the summary in plain text. It's also possible to make the text more appealing/interesting (more visual and less dull) for the reader.  For example, using shorter words and stronger, ""hotter"" sentences to make the summary more appealing/interesting.

I read each paragraph as two separate sentences. That way, the one about supply chain issues has a verb, and the one about inequality has a gerund. I find it much easier to read, then use paragraph breaks when it becomes really long.

Agreed! (However, please take a look at our HN guidelines on formatting: )

''`There is more than one way for governments and central banks to respond to the crisis. Some central banks have engaged in quantitative easing (QE); others are now contemplating negative interest rates. Still others have resorted to lending programs with low rates, but with a high probability of non-repayment of funds by banks. Fiscal support has been the least effective of all methods. The crisis is worsening inequalities in the access to finance. The response is needed urgently and it is imperative that it be both equitable and proportionate to the crisis.

33203,1,"The global economic system is highly unstable due to climate change, geopolitical tensions, low growth, and rising inequality.
Governments of various states have responded with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages. However, these interventions have had limited effect so far. In addition, a long-term change in the growth model is needed.
Government spending must increase significantly if the world is to successfully recover from the COVID-19 crisis. At the same time, fiscal measures that increase public debt must be accompanied by more effective and more rapid changes to taxation in order to ensure the economic viability of all states in the long run. For this to be possible, tax revenues must be redirected toward the public good and toward the fight against climate change, as well as in the effort to combat income inequality.
A stronger and more inclusive economy must be built that is both more environmentally friendly and more equal, especially in terms of women's participation. If this can be achieved, we can then start to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs 10.3, 10.4, 10.6, and 12.3) and reach the goal of the United Nations: `To end poverty in its various forms` in a more effective and sustainable manner.

The world economy will struggle with these challenges in 2020, creating opportunities for new businesses, disruptive technologies, and new business models, yet they present an increased threat to human existence than at any time since the end of World War II. The COVID-19 pandemic is already a historic catastrophe, yet it is not the only risk to which global economies are exposed; climate change and geopolitical tensions remain severe risks to economic growth. As economies begin to recover from the pandemic, they are already operating under much higher debt levels and, in many countries, fiscal deficits may remain elevated for some years. High levels of national debt have proven to be a dangerous risk in the past, but global conditions may be different in 2020. Even so, high levels of debt coupled with the pandemic have already made economic stability more difficult for emerging markets and developing countries; if global debt levels continue to increase rapidly, the likelihood of a crisis becomes higher. The economic contraction in 2020 is likely to cause the unemployment rate to increase in advanced economies for the first time since the financial crisis.

 Article: By Claire Parker. Last updated at 5:59 PM on 18th November 2011. Douglas Tompkins is a man who has made a career out of finding business opportunities in far-flung corners of the developing world. He has spent a fortune buying up land - the rights to which he claims gives him the power to dictate government policy in countries such as Peru and Bolivia - so he can conserve biodiversity in some of the world's most threatened ecosystems. This is no mean feat, because biodiversity - everything from flora to fauna - is a global phenomenon. Yet, on Mr Tompkins's watch, it has largely gone unseen, overlooked and undervalued. Now South America's former president Cristina Fernandez is threatening to nationalize his land at a hefty price. Critics say that"

As governments attempt to boost their economies in this difficult economic reality, it is vital that these measures are aimed at the right areas as they will play a vital role in supporting the local and global economies over the next decade.
The main priority for the next one to two years should be to provide economic stimuli towards areas that promote sustainable growth, such as environmentally friendly infrastructure that is less impacted by the COVID-19.

41336,3,"Climate change: Global average surface temperature will increase by a maximum of 3.5 to 5.8F (2-4°C) by 2100.

Tropical cyclone winds and storm surges were greater than expected, reaching up to 135 miles an hour, and water levels in coastal rivers were 1.3 to 2.9 feet above the baseline, resulting in catastrophic flooding in the low lying northern part of the region.

Tropical cyclones can have serious ecological and social impacts. Their destruction of forest-cover in India has raised concerns about increased deforestation and release of greenhouse gases and other pollutants..

Background: Indian scientists expect that the cyclone will have long term ecological and social effects. Forests in coastal India are home to many endangered species of species and the effects of a large scale hurricane-like event on the forest ecosystems is yet to be assessed.

 Article: By. Ian Bremmer. Some call it the Fourth Industrial Revolution and others call it The Age of Accelerating Returns. Whatever you call it, the current pandemic is already making history. According to a team of economists who analyzed the 2003 SARS epidemic in China, China’s economy lost around 1.8% of gross domestic product the day the first case of the virus was confirmed. That’s around $250 billion in today’s terms. A more recent estimate, now that COVID-19 is more widespread, points to a global GDP loss on a par with the Great Depression. And that comes from a team led by the renowned economist, Nicholas Lardy of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. China’s GDP has slowed due to COVID-19 but the rest of the world’s has not. The rest of the world, however, will be hit hardest by the economic fallout from the epidemic.

Not the least of which will be the fact that they will be playing their football in the middle of a crippling global pandemic, that even now threatens to take away the lives of the citizens of both Rwanda and Sierra Leone, both of them with relatively small fan bases.
This is a situation that is bound to cause anxiety to the footballing community because these situations have more often than not affected not only players from clubs but all their support staff across the world

    The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. Economic growth has slowed considerably across both developed and developing nations. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are exacerbating economic inequalities, making it harder for low-income families to afford basic necessities. Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth. A primary focal point of global economic policy has been financial markets, which, despite considerable distress and volatility, seem to have stabilized, with the S&P 500 Index climbing about 25 percent year-to-date.
    A secondary focal point has been emerging-market assets, such as currencies and bonds, which have continued to suffer due to elevated policy uncertainty, especially in developing nations.

Economic growth has slowed considerably and governments are responding with a mix of fiscal injections and policy reforms. Governments worldwide are facing increased fiscal pressures caused by the rising costs of fighting the pandemic both at national and international levels. For the global economy, it is not only a health emergency on the physical front, but it is also putting severe strains on global supply chains. Trade has slowed drastically, raising doubts about the future functioning of the world economy. The global recovery and restoration of growth will become harder due to the higher costs of producing essential goods in this time of uncertainty. This is also a period when governments will have to take on new burdens of debt. For the moment, governments are taking the necessary measures to control public spending given their weakened balance sheets. They are also working to control the rise in global inflation by ensuring that supply chains function more smoothly. At the same time, countries that depend heavily on tourism, and have suffered major losses due to the pandemic, are struggling to cope with the decline in revenue. At present, the global economy and especially developing economies are facing extraordinary challenges that require a highly coordinated effort from all the global stakeholders and all financial stakeholders"

58267,3,"This year is an opportunity for the African Diaspora to share their wealth and expertise. African countries will continue to grow in the next decade even if the rest of the world does not. The African Diaspora is a major contributor to countries such as Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, etc., but a lot of these countries are suffering a slow burn collapse due to an over reliance on the fossil fuel industry. This needs to change.
  The African Diaspora has the expertise to build the green sectors and contribute their knowledge and their resources both inside and outside Africa. An example of this is the success of the solar industry in the United States where the African American population is roughly 12% of the total U.S population. The energy independence movement that is gaining traction in the U.S. needs the African American community to become an active part of its growth.
In fact, the energy industry may be the best example of the green economy working perfectly because solar power is the greenest of the green resources. This sector is flourishing in Africa with some of the highest solar power production rates in the world. This needs to change.
  African countries are working to develop a green economy that will not only help mitigate the impact of climate change but will transform economies"

A report last Thursday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found that the Africa's economy contracted by 1.9 percent last year, compared with 1.7 percent growth predicted in April. The decline was largely due to a sharp rise in unemployment: Africa's jobless rate rose from 13.8 percent in 2019 to 17.5 percent last year as lockdowns to fight the COVID-19 pandemic closed businesses and halted trade.

How can the summary and the headline match, when the title contains the word ""faster"".
How can the summary and the headline match, when they use two different numbers for the GDP growth rates, when the number for the headline's headline number is from a survey, and the survey number in the headline is from a different data source from the survey number in the title?
How can the headline and the summary match when neither number is from a survey but both are from the latest government statistics?
How can the headline and the summary match, when both numbers are from independent sources, when the number in the headline is from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and the CSO is not controlled by the government, whereas the number in the summary is from the Economic and Social Research Institute?
How can the headline and the summary match when one number is stated as 'GDP growth', but one of the phrases 'fastest growth' or 'fastest falling' is stated in the summary?
What can explain the discrepancy?

Is it possible to post a single sentence with a question mark in its headline?"
81360,1,"We can't put our heads in the sand about climate change and the cost of decarbonising the economy, but we're wasting time and energy and driving up costs.```
The government argues this is ```wrong``` and ```would be``` at a time of crisis and ```isn't even factually correct```. They provide a cost estimate of £100bn annually, which the authors say is ```completely over-stated``` but at the same time cite the Institute of Fiscal Studies which claims the cost is more likely to be £50bn. Neither of these estimates seems to be a true reflection of the true cost, due to the fact that the IFS study did not estimate or compare the costs to the benefits of a low-carbon economy nor look at carbon sequestration.
The author doesn't supply evidence to back up his claim and cites various reports, reports and other research, but it is not clear at what point the government was ```wrong``` and not making progress? Was it as soon as ministers started taking actions? This seems to ignore the government's efforts to take a leadership position to move the world away from fossil fuels, including the investment in technology, R & D, the tax breaks and spending"

89727,4,"This article highlights the role of governments globally in responding to the coronavirus pandemic. Governments around the world have enacted economic stimulus packages to support their populations, with the US, UK and Japan leading the way. These packages have included increases to unemployment benefits and direct financial relief to households. These packages will be critical in mitigating the potential long-term effects of the pandemic and recession. They are also essential to offsetting the impact at the national level. However, the size and speed of such fiscal support varies significantly between countries. Some advanced economies had relatively robust fiscal positions before the crisis. The fiscal deficits in the eurozone and the US are lower than pre-crisis levels. The governments of Australia, Canada and Japan, in comparison, had relatively weak fiscal positions before the crisis, which will increase their borrowing costs during the downturn. As a result, many European governments have increased borrowing, and other advanced economies are likely to do the same. In emerging economies, the magnitude of fiscal responses will be considerably smaller, owing to both the magnitude of fiscal space, and the less resilient fiscal position in most emerging economies. The impact on growth will therefore be less. The pandemic is exacerbating preexisting inequalities in income access among low and middle-income households. Social safety"

91843,1,"It sounds counterintuitive but giving babies more allergens earlier in their lives may make their immune systems more resilient against asthma later in life. This is a key observation because, as previously reported, the risk of asthma in children is highest in the first decade of life and continues for at least a decade more. This is when babies are developing at an extremely delicate time in their lives, and so any adverse effect on their immune system could affect the development of their immune systems as they develop and mature. But new research suggests that this is no longer a concern.  ```

The global COVID-19 vaccine R&D is expected to increase the capacity of vaccine production, in an effort to protect humanity from the risk of future outbreaks.

The food delivery industry will likely see a surge in the coming weeks as consumers seek out food and household essentials on the internet, and the market capitalization of the major players looks to hold steady. Delivery companies such as DoorDash have experienced a huge upswing in sales in the last month, as consumers opt to avoid crowded stores. However, the increasing volume of order activity can be negatively impacted by the logistical difficulties of operating during a pandemic, which is why some companies are opting out of the space entirely. As online grocery shopping becomes more prominent, companies such as Instacart and Shipt are seeing an uptick in job postings within the industry, as customers struggle to cope with delays in delivery times. Other delivery companies have seen a decrease in demand for their services, as a lack of consumer product demand has made it less essential for many people to have a physical presence in the store. Delivery companies that are able to adapt in response to the increased demand for services"

The primary use of lists in an EL is to break a long story into discrete chunks. A list makes this possible, but the story may still be coherent in an EL that does not use lists.

Lists are used to break up sentences into distinct parts which will be presented in different sections of an EL (such as articles, summaries, or graphics). The most common lists used in ELs are bullets, numbered lists, numbered bullets, numbered numbered lists, and numbered numbered bullets, which are sometimes referred to as lists. Some authors prefer to use other kinds of breaks (brackets or underlines, for example), especially if their prose is non-modular and does not lend itself to lists, but they would work just as well and are just as commonly used.

Bold text or other formatting in boldface refers to a section title. It usually appears immediately after the section header.

35594,0,"A woman therapist who helps affluent girls is understood to have been arrested on suspicion of fraud.'' How much sense does this make? In English, summary sentences are short sentences that summarize other sentences. Short summary sentences can be used to give information to readers who don't want the entire article or paragraphs. We don't normally use these short summary sentences in the original text but when we must we use words that describe what's written in the articles, like ""understood,"" ""believed,"" etc.

 This practice is common in newspapers and magazines and can be seen in all kinds of information systems on the web (web pages, news websites, etc.)

 One of the problems with summarizing articles is that there is often a gap between the summary sentence and the whole article. You could make a great, meaningful summary sentence about an article, but when people look at the web page the summary sentence usually isn't there. Sometimes the summary is a short phrase, sometimes it's a bulleted list.

 Another problem is that summarizers often leave out information from"

Article: This brave climber braved death as he scaled his first ice mountain in Russia. But to his astonishment - he came out with a camera in his hand. This is the incredible moment the 35-year-old Dan Arkle scaled 1,800-metre-high Tazhin mountain in the Chelyabinsk region of Russia to reach the top. Mr Arkle said: 'It had been one of the most nerve-wracking and stressful things I've ever done in my life. But reaching the summit felt unreal.' He had to climb up and down the glacier which was 'covered in ice and snow most of the time' and had to avoid the falling rocks. And despite having climbed mountains in other parts of the world - like Mt Kilimanjaro in Africa - he said 'this is by far the most difficult.' The climber said he was worried about getting frostbite and frostnip, but said the experience was rewarding. 'Climbing a mountain is a mixture of fear and"

Those were the first few lines of an email written by British author JK Rowling as a way of thanking supporters a decade ago. The author and mother of a baby son was diagnosed with post-natal depression and, since 2002, has devoted herself to fighting the stigma in the treatment and the stigma itself of a condition that’s one the world’s most deadly, kills an estimated 1% of mothers a year in Europe and up to 30% among Latin American women. Her best-seller Harry Potter, which first hit the shelves in 1998, is one of the best-loved series of all time. But the last book was put on hold indefinitely by her publisher after the author made a series of posts on Twitter. Rowling has said she had to do it to get the attention of people in power that the problem needs to be taken seriously and for social change to happen. One of the things the British government’s National Crime Agency is doing to combat this is through a project called Operation Alice, which is taking on the world’s worst online child traffickers.

Innovation & Disruptive Economy
With the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, one thing has become clear: the world, and especially developing countries, do not have the luxury of a long or easy road to recovery. The future is uncertain; the growth rate will be lower for a longer time.
Even the most optimistic scenarios, which call for a strong and ‘robust’ recovery, are subject to risks, including a scenario of a second wave of infections, a longer recession or the possibility of a ‘second wave’ of job losses and a ‘second wave’ of income loss, and so on. In addition, the world faces a range of ‘disruptors’, many of which can be the trigger for long-lasting negative consequences.
Among these is the climate emergency, which is not just about the effects of global warming.

Article: To fight coronavirus, some experts are proposing an idea that seems more dystopic than dystopian: tracking everyone's phone  and forcing them to take their temperature.
But the idea is not without precedent.
A year ago, some experts promoted a similar proposal to track people's temperature from smartphones to stop the spread of the flu.
We don't know if it worked.
The idea took off on a virus map called The COVID Watchlist, as people joked about using technology to stop people from dying.
If public health experts succeed, at least a few of us may soon carry around a phone app that tracks our symptoms and lets us know if we need to seek medical help.
But other countries including Singapore and South Korea are already developing apps where citizens upload data and use government tracking technology for the public good.
South Korea's app uses GPS and bluetooth data to determine whether a smartphone is within half a meter of someone who has been COVID-19-infected.
Singapore also uses the bluetooth function to determine the duration of someone's encounters with another user's smartphone.

The Playstation VR is the most recent VR headset to hit the market, being released on the 13th October 2016. Although it is the cheapest of the four VR headsets we reviewed, you still have to have a Playstation 4 console and a Playstation camera to play.

You can sit or stand and look around whilst using it, and you cannot walk around.

One of the major points about the Playstation VR, which separates it from the other headsets, is that there are already lots of games available for it, with more on the way.

It's one of the more technically advanced headsets available, and is completely immersive.

Its sensors help to warn you of objects around you and stop you from bumping into things."
94842,2,"Article: The world is faced with numerous challenges on a daily basis, from the common cold to climate change, globalisation to terrorism. Technology may be a solution to a lot of problems, or to some, it might not. The debate of ‘Artificial Intelligence’ has become one of the most hotly debated ideas in the 21st-century, and some are predicting that it will change the world. Technology expert, Mark Zuckerberg, who created the social media site Facebook, believes that “virtual reality” will completely change the way we live and work. So if the technology existed that could give you a life-size replica of something you like, have you ever thought about doing it?’
Summary: According to Mark Zuckerberg, virtual reality, or ‘VR’, is “going to change the way we live and work and communicate.” In reality, for the majority of the world, buying a virtual reality headset may be out of reach, so Zuckerberg’s thoughts may only be applicable to the higher echelons of the tech world. Virtual reality headsets can be very costly and require powerful computers to run them, making them unfeasible for people who are not already involved in technology. As well, there are"

The crisis is likely to further disrupt supply chains and lead to rising inflation. There are significant geopolitical tensions throughout the world leading to more geopolitical uncertainty in the short term. It is likely to increase inequality further. Governments are increasing their fiscal stimulus and supporting demand, while also improving their fiscal policies which will help mitigate the effects of the crisis in the short term. However in the medium to long term the crisis will worsen inequality and increase government deficits and debt-to-GDP ratio, which could lead to higher debt levels in the medium term. Economic growth slows further in the medium term. Fiscal stimulus and support will be withdrawn quickly over a number of years, resulting in a gradual economic slowdown. ```

Economic growth for both developed and developing nations has slowed significantly in the last year. Supply chain impacts and inflationary pressures are creating economic inequalities, making it harder for lower income families to afford basic necessities. In recent days, the United States and China have seen their bilateral relationship deteriorate as the US steps up its trade battle. European Union countries have already fallen into recession, despite fiscal stimulus measures, as supply chains have become strained and manufacturing has plummeted. Other major economies such as India and Japan are fighting rising infections as the virus makes inroads. While the economic outlook for 2021 is improving, with vaccines being rolled out and economies expected to open up in the second half of 2021, the outlook remains uncertain, and governments worldwide will need to continue to support their economies with fiscal stimulus and other measures until COVID-19 rates have begun to fall.

The global economy began to experience signs of COVID-19's effect in its growth trajectory in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the prolonged global trade slowdown.

It means some people might have to pay higher rates if they're older, or risk a ban on driving if they're on the older side too.
The changes mean you will no longer have to pay for motor insurance when you're a learner driver, or if you're not in charge of the car.

The impact of this latest crisis is further compounded by a new surge in global greenhouse gas emissions due to deforestation, increasing poverty levels and increased inequality, while climate-related natural disasters become more frequent and severe. Faced with these extraordinary circumstances, a new and sustainable development paradigm is needed that puts human and environmental wellbeing at the center of policymaking.

The article has a number of good points. I can't say this is the worst summary I have ever seen, given that it is a matter of public record that ""the global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change.""

The first two sentences could be written, perhaps better said, using the past tense. I am not sure whether I can explain why that makes a big difference.
""Growth has slowed"" or ""Growth has slowed"" could convey an impression of a long-term decline or an expectation that it will go on going down. On the other hand, the same statement that uses past tense would convey the impression of a near-term bounce-back.

30609,1,"In the United States, we have seen some very high-profile attacks on medical supply chains. A good example of this is this morning, as the FDA shut down a plant on the premises of Smith & Nephew (NYSE:SN.L). Smith & Nephew is a medical device company (makers of artificial hips and joints), and the FDA believes that the company is not following sufficient federal guidelines. Here on Planet Earth, there is another example of a medical supply chain attacked. This one is in China. It's the Wuhan plant of Sanmei Microelectronics (SMEI). SMEI is a chip designer (think Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)). It's a Tier 1 supplier to Apple. And like Smith & Nephew, SMEI was raided... and shutdown. Apple was one of the first U.S. companies to complain. In fact, Apple did it three days before the FDA raid and in less than a week, Apple's stock price had more than recovered. ```

 Article: By. Laura Cox. BBC One viewers have complained to the broadcaster about the sound quality of the latest episode of Quirke. The drama, which airs on the channel on Sunday nights at 9pm, was hit by claims that it was hard to hear what the actors and their dialogue were saying. According to the Times, viewers complained that they had to turn on subtitles or crank up the volume on their television sets. Viewers also felt that the background sounds in the show had not been improved. One wrote on Twitter: 'Just finished watching Quirke and could not make out 30 per cent of the dialogue as it was mumbly sounding'. Another tweeted: '@bbctv Please improve the sound quality of Quirke'. Gabriel Byrne (right) stars as the character"

First, a crushing disappointment came a day after a resounding victory following the early loss of the toss. On Monday they travelled down to the University Oval for a day-night County Championship fixture against Lancashire, only for the contest to be called off at the start of play due to bad light. The sun had come out by the time it was deemed safe to resume later in the week, yet Hampshire struggled to get the runs they needed to push on, falling well short in an innings defeat. Their second match of the 2019 season saw them dismissed for just 109 by Surrey. The visitors had reached 46-1 by close of play on the first day, before losing four more quick wickets overnight. By the time the fourth day rolled around that all-important overnight partnership of 77 was gone as well, and Surrey made just the one change for the day's play on the Monday morning, with Will Jacks replacing Lewis Gregory. Jacks responded magnificently to the challenge, scoring 95 as Surrey saw them home by eight wickets with almost eight overs in hand. Then in their next match Hampshire's batsmen failed miserably yet again"

Analysing and interpreting the sample sentence and summary.

1.What is the main message of the article?

The main message of the article is that the global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change.

2.How is this message conveyed in the sample sentences of the summary?

The sample sentences in the summary help us identify the “key takeaways” the authors want us to grasp from the article. We might find that certain sentences contain more information about the main message of the article, while other sentences mention only the overall context and background.

The plain-text sentence is better because

1) it has no clutter. A bunch of lists of links or URLs in text messes up the layout and makes it hard to scan.
2) it is a short summary

In terms of the second reason, this sentence is almost as long as the article.

The World Bank warns in its June Economic Prospects report that the pandemic has caused `an estimated 4% drop in global gross domestic product.`. This is the deepest recession since WWII. The United Nations recently projected that global GDP will decline by 3% in 2020. Growth in 2021 will also be low, but should be somewhat better than this year. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions continue to plague the world with the possibility of further nuclear testing by North Korea and the potential for a conflict on the Korean Peninsula. Climate change is also presenting a major existential threat. Extreme weather is worsening and the climate crisis is expected to worsen rapidly in the coming years. Despite these challenges, global GDP is expected to resume growth in 2022. However, the World Bank forecasts that economic losses from COVID-19 could exceed the GDP lost in the 2008 financial crisis. Even if the COVID-19 pandemic eases in the second half of 2020, economic fallout will continue and slow economic growth is likely until 2022."

Article: Richard Carasso, a former federal prosecutor on loan to the special counsel, has been on the case of Stone all along. He has been a leading figure in the special counsel’s investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election – and his role in the Ukraine scandal that prompted impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. Now, he expects more criminal charges would be forthcoming. “He could very well become a target of the special counsel because of his proximity to the President,” Carasso told POLITICO. “He's very much a central player in a number of these events. I expect some additional actions to be taken against Roger Stone very shortly.” There are indications of new criminal activity in Stone’s case. On Monday, CNN and MSNBC published text messages between former Clinton White House official Joe Lockhart and Stone in 2015.

Article: By. Karen Brown. UPDATED:. 09:18 EST, 9 September 2011. A new coalition has been formed in the Commons that promises to tackle the 'West Lothian question', as well as improve democracy after Brexit. The West Lothian question, a thorn in England's side for decades, refers to the problem of English policy being decided by MPs representing people from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is often used by MPs from outside these countries to argue against giving the countries devolved powers or regional MPs. On Wednesday at Westminster, the Commons backed proposals set out in the House of Commons Commission's report on an independent commission to scrutinise the West Lothian question. Some Conservative MPs, including David Mellor and Tim Yeo accused the current system of allowing Scottish MPs"

A number of alternative solutions have been proposed, including the establishment of a purely English parliament and the granting of the `right` of an English MP to vote on all matters relevant to the UK Parliament (although no such right currently exists). However, solutions which have been suggested for the problem have all proved unpopular. This is largely because the issue is one that is extremely sensitive for politicians representing parts of England who believe that such decisions should be taken by their fellow MPs.

The outbreak is still in its early days, with only the beginning of lockdown measures being implemented, and the impact will only be known over the coming weeks and months. The economic impact of the virus outbreak has been felt across the globe and will affect the global economy for years to come. With some estimates estimating the economic impact to be as high as $10 trillion, the full extent of the damage cannot be measured yet, with estimates spanning the range of 60% to 90% in the short term, and perhaps 50% to 90% in the medium term. Global GDP growth will be significantly reduced, with estimates ranging up to 4% contraction in 2020. Unemployment will rise sharply, in some countries it is already at or close to its 2008 peak, with estimates suggesting a 7 million increase by the end of 2020.

The world is changing faster than ever, driven by technology, global markets, open societies, free trade, an interconnected world economy, and people and societies that demand an increasing diversity of goods and services. And yet we are still relying on antiquated systems, such as the World Trade Organization, that are no longer able to handle the demands in an ever changing world. At a time when new ideas, approaches, and strategies are needed, the way we currently do business, especially when it comes to trade and globalization, is no longer fit for purpose. In the last decade we have seen some major global trade and trade policy reforms in developed and emerging market economies - the"

From the time of its emergence in the Chinese city of Wuhan, China, in December 2019, it has become a global pandemic. The pandemic has claimed over 230,000 lives and infected more than 2.4 million people across the world. The disease has wreaked havoc across the globe as major economies such as the US, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, and the UK are struggling to deal with the rising number of cases and deaths. In order to deal with the economic situation, governments have provided economic and fiscal stimulus packages. Governments globally have also taken policy reforms.

It omits to mention that global economic growth is the lowest in over   30 years, that global inequality has increased to the point where the top 1% own more than the bottom 99%, and that this is the result of   a decade in which inequality increased by 75%.

If a machine reading an input summary with only text as the input can be given a reasonably high degree of error tolerance by using a high level summary with links and more complicated details, then it is reasonable for the human being reading the summary to make errors.  However, the machine's reading of the summary may have much lower error tolerances and so the human summarizer, instead of providing the correct summary, may provide an incorrect one.  The human reader may have been taught only to read summaries, and so the summaries may have to be explained to him by the teacher as well as providing the correct information. The resulting machine is not able to produce a summary even close to what people understand the topic to mean, even though it can find a summary that a"

The real question is why are they still allowed to write summaries?  It seems that the answer is they can not be allowed to post summaries using the AP Stylebook.

That's what I was referring to. What's the point in a summary if I need a URL to see what's inside, so I can decide not to open a link?  Maybe they use a summary because the actual article is too long, but then why not just link to the original story, which has a very well-designed layout that makes it easy for readers to find what they want  in the article.

How so?

The global economy is on the way to recovery and the worst economic recession in decades. The World Bank estimates that the global GDP has shrunk by 4.2% in 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the largest and deepest global recession since World War II. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to cripple economic activities throughout the globe as the number of infections surpasses 102 million. The economic losses are more than $11.7 trillion globally and in 2020 alone the loss has reached $8 trillion. The report warns that the pandemic and consequent lockdowns are inflicting more damage on the poorer and developing economies which are highly dependent on services and industry. The crisis is causing unprecedented social and economic disruptions across the world and reversing development gains and is adversely affecting millions of people leading to greater impoverishment and inequality. The World Bank projects that global output will return to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2022, after which it forecasts a 2.4% growth in 2021, which, if sustained over the coming years will lead to a modest recovery in GDP over the next five"

Summarizing or summarizing articles like this above is an exact science.

We have an idea for a site which provides simple summaries of articles like these.

Here is an example summary of the most up to date article for a real estate magazine: 

Interesting. What do you think about posting real estate-related summaries without the URL or without an URL to the original article? If people have the time to read the entire article just for a summary, they probably already have the time to go to the source and read the article.

The summary is meant to be a quick and dirty, and I'm fine with the articles without hyperlinks if people want to post them. I'll approve summaries. I'll remove real estate-related articles when something like this comes up, though."

At the same time, the global economy has been hit by a deep political and social crisis. As a result, growth is expected to have been slow during 2020. At the end of 2020, a large number of countries will be facing political and social challenges leading to a new era of uncertainty. Many governments will face an economic crisis. Governments across the globe are responding to this crisis with a mix of fiscal stimuli and policy reforms. This will be accompanied by increasing pressure on government budgets. Governments will also face a more pronounced threat of rising debt burdens. On the positive side, it will be important to focus on the areas of cooperation between nations, to address the climate crisis and to tackle other global and economic challenges.

Hi! We just had very first version of an app, where you could write your summary in plain text. Let us know if you are interested in a closed beta.

The problem is that the summary is already the subject heading and the summary is already present on the page, the first sentence of summaries is sometimes the title and the rest might be the introduction, why would someone need to type something to summarise?

As a software engineer looking to get involved with a start-up focused on summarizing news, this article is fantastic and a really well written example of the problem. I've been meaning to read for months, but kept putting it off.. Thanks and I'll have to keep an eye out for your guys' product.

This is the same as what happens on a news website in the URL or title tag of every article, right?

56999,3,"Global warming could wipe half a million Asian tigers from the face of the earth by the end of this century, according to a new study. The tigers, or Prionailurus bengalensis, are among 25 threatened animal species, including rhinos, giant pandas and Siberian tigers, facing the worst effects of climate change. They are most affected in the Himalayas, where glaciers have retreated by an average of 3m since 2003, they say. The study, by an international team of researchers, modelled a range of climate scenarios. It found that by the end of this century a third of the tigers would be extinct. ``There is some uncertainty about the results, but our best estimate is that between 1,200 and 8,200 of these animals will go extinct in the next 70 years, although some species may be better able to adapt than others. While some may adapt, we are certain there will be dramatic declines. That is why it is so important to do something about this now,' said Matthew England, the head of the zoology department at Oxford University and from the research team, published in Science.

What is the question?
""What is the best way to summarize the article?""
What information do you need and how should it be presented?

You might be looking at it from too much of an academic angle. Just try to convey the gist of the article, but in a form that fits the narrative of the article.

Just my two cents

How is it not academic? Forcing myself to write summary is a way of learning to write better and summarise articles properly/with focus. In real world, people rely on brief summaries of articles to help them understand if they have missed important details, or where the author is focussing his attention."
22178,0,"Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is gearing up to resume his role as a legislative leader in what will be the most divided Congress in a half century. The former vice president has assembled a team of bipartisan advisers, who are scheduled to help him craft and sell his agenda to the American public.```

      If the headlines of the articles below are omitted:
      ```Falling back on his experience for decades on Capitol Hill,'' Biden plans to immediately begin building relationships across the government and seeking common ground with Republicans on infrastructure and other issues."
22178,1,"Biden has a lot of experience, but he hasn`t always been the right policy and he`s got some pretty wacky ideas still. It`s not a knock at his intelligence. It`s a knock at his ability as a public speaker.```.

So what do you think about that example? Any suggestions on how to improve it?

I know it's a hack for the time being, but you could also try an approach like https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18282350 [1] which will take the HTML from your markdown and format it nicely. In your case you could style it however you want before submitting it.

Yes, I do that with most of my longer articles.
What I tried to do with this one was to combine the ease of editing with the convenience of reading through a summary of the main arguments.
There was a time when, when I wasn`t doing this, when I would simply write the full article in the browser without the help of a CMS, which is also the format which is probably supported best by HN.

The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. Economic growth has slowed considerably across both developed and developing nations. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are exacerbating economic inequalities, making it harder for low-income families to afford basic necessities. Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth.

The results of our meta-analysis examining economic crises and the responses (or lack thereof) by governments to the challenges they present indicate that a fiscal response that is more timely, is larger and has more effective target(s) is the key component of successful fiscal response to a global economic crisis. When we looked closely at policies in response to the Great Recession of the 2000s and the most recent recession, we found that the most effective fiscal response among the 25 countries that experienced both was Canada’s combination of tax increases and spending cuts that were spread across multiple years. Moreover, these responses were more effective when they took more time to implement, were larger and better targeted.

Policy makers seem to be falling behind in their responses to the current global crisis. For"

To give you a sense of the quality of the articles you need, the summary should read like the summary of an introduction to a book. If you think of it that way, it should take about half a page. So, a good summary, using a similar standard to give you an idea of the standard, should:

 - Have no extra word counts on top of the words above.
 - Have no lists or any other formatting besides that of the text, though it may be helpful to set a font size and other formatting to help the reader.
 - Not include more complex topics - no jargon, no ""abstractions"" (e.g. ```the global economy is..."").
 - Present the information in a way that makes sense. This is not about following Wikipedia's style - in particular, you cannot use a numbered list of nouns and verbs, that's too basic.
 - Have enough detail on the issues to be useful.

The main points should be:

Who:
- Who is important? This can be a company, a country or any other entity or person.
- What is their importance"

However, although he is in hospice and his life expectancy is approaching zero, he's keeping his usual cheery demeanour and trying to enjoy his time left with his loved ones.

He underwent a series of treatments in London, including a brain mastectomy, brain radiosurgery and chemotherapy.
Since, he's been able to keep that cheery demeanour and good humour as he battles the disease and its complications in a hospice close to his home in Chesterfield.

This is a good example of how summarizing text can produce a significantly different output than the raw text.
While the sentence above can be used to understand what the article is about without reading the article, we can build a much richer picture with the text.
If we include a list or URLs then the word ""cricket"" is highlighted, a list gives examples of word combinations that are usually used together, and the final sentence in (b) is explained -- which all give further context as to what the article is about.
The article is actually about the economic impact of current problems and how countries are mitigating them on a global scale. A list of challenges is more important than the plain-text one.

The main problem with text summaries is that people can't click to go to the full website, so they have trouble finding new information, and are less likely to read it.

If you click on the headline, it will take you to a much nicer looking page for that topic:

The headline is misleading. The article is more detailed than headline. The full article content isn't any good.

I thought that headline would take me to the full article. Instead it takes me to the top of Google's listing of the word ""cricket"" (as in the game). If you put in the title exactly, only the headline will be taken.

I've long advocated summaries of articles as alternative or supplemental reading, for the sake of the person's time and ability to recall what was in the piece.
That the summaries are often poor is unfortunately unsurprising.

I've wondered about this myself. So I wrote a library to implement what I would like to read in such a format.

The United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) estimates that the global pandemic could depress global economic output by 1 per cent and global trade by up to 30 per cent, increasing the rate of poverty by about 7 per cent, or by up to 150 million people, due to loss of income and livelihoods. Developing nations are especially susceptible for high poverty and food insecurity, since over half of the developing countries’ public expenditures are allocated to health and social spending, while the corresponding figure for developed nations is much lower.

Global Economy Stabilizing, But Geopolitical Tensions and Climate Change Will Challenge Growth
June 8, 2021 | Wall Street Journal Editorial Board
By William Mauldin and James T. Kennedy
For decades, global economic growth was driven by the development of new technologies and increasing productivity. Those forces are still at work, but climate change, geopolitical tensions and increasing trade friction threaten to undermine the steady gains of the past few decades. Stabilizing the global economy requires a focused focus on technology and increasing productivity to ensure that growth is sustained in the face of these threats.
The global economy may be on the mend, but it is far from recovered. For the first five months of 2021, the global economy was 3.5% below the first five months of pre-pandemic 2019 - the pace of growth was the same as in the fourth quarter of last year. The drop in the first five months was the second-largest global economic contraction ever during a calendar year. In the euro area, real GDP was less than 1% above its pre-pandemic level in the first quarter. In the United Kingdom, Japan and Brazil"

This comes as fears are growing that the crisis could lead to a recession that, in turn, may push the U.S. into a financial crisis within a matter of months. Meanwhile, U.K. retail sales fell for the first time in a year over Christmas in the final week of December.

The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change.

Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth.

Support measures

Governments worldwide are counteracting these challenges with a range of support measures.   Fiscal stimulus packages amount to over 10% of global output.  There have also been numerous policy reforms. For instance:

•	Some governments, such as France and New Zealand, are expanding welfare support systems and subsidizing working hours while protecting incomes. This is estimated to increase public spending by 20% of GDP by 2022 and is expected to raise global GDP over the same period by 2.6%.
•	There is a growing appreciation for the need for the green economy. Governments have made significant commitments to climate change targets.
•	The International Monetary Fund and World Bank have recommended a reduction in government borrowing targets to free public funds that can be"

The article uses a simple form of a rhetorical question. This rhetorical question can be answered with a simple fact or a list of other facts that support it. For example, in the above article, the fact that ""economic growth has slowed considerably across both developed and developing nations"" could be answered with the simple fact that the United Nations has reported that international economic output dropped 3.2 percent in 2009, the steepest decline since 1945, as a result of the global recession.

72653,1,"Global climate change is real and it is devastating. Since 1850, the temperature of the whole Earth has increased by approximately 2.6C and in 2010 alone global air temperatures rose to record high levels. However, the most immediate threat comes in the form of extreme conditions such droughts and storms. Extreme weather events are predicted to increase, and many countries, cities and regions are already experiencing the impact of climate change, ranging from severe flooding in Europe, drought in South Africa to prolonged hot temperatures in India and Japan. These extreme weather events threaten basic services for hundreds of millions of people while costing the global economy billions. Climate change has become one of the most pressing issues for governments and the public alike and has also come into the headlines as a top election issue in many countries across the world. As world leaders gather in Madrid ahead of the next climate conference taking place in November 2020, this report shows what we need to do to meet the Paris Agreement. Governments need to come together and agree on realistic but ambitious measures that enable the world to keep warming below 2℃.""

68426,3,"The economy is recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, but many sectors are struggling, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). As businesses begin to recover, policymakers must be mindful of the structural damage wrought by the pandemic, the need for resilient financial systems, and the need to improve the regulatory environment to support the next phase of growth in the longer term. In this paper, we discuss how governments can mitigate the structural fragilities caused by the COVID-19 crisis. We also suggest that, if governments address the pandemic´s long-term impacts, a return to pre-pandemic high growth rates can be achieved.```"

The word ''impolite'' in this context, to me, may have a positive connotation. Perhaps impolite is not the right word. We are looking for some way to help people be plugged in (being friendly, sociable, etc.) without interrupting their current activity. However, it seems to me that if I was being polite I would try to find other time to talk to the other person, as I would not want to interrupt their current activity or make them feel at a loss if trying to think about what they want to say.

The New York Times provides more than 5000 such summary articles each week (mostly about technology, business, sports and entertainment).

57075,3,"The world as a whole, including parts of the European Union, may start to emerge from the coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic this year at the earliest.” However, that is just a probability. It is important to remember that Covid-19 is by no means over, nor should it ever be taken for granted. This is still a global pandemic, and the world must remain vigilant as infection rates rise again in parts of the world.
Given the uncertainty, governments should still remain extremely prudent. That includes remaining on course to implement fiscal stimulus and structural reforms. As a result, the global economy will probably recover over the next few years – and not the many years claimed by many – but without strong fundamentals at the core, the recovery will be fragile and fragile growth will be accompanied by very high inflation once the stimulus and monetary support are withdrawn.
The combination of inflation rates as high as 2.5% and real GDP growth rates significantly below 3% for many years will also pose a great challenge to governments in the developed and developing worlds.

News articles
In the news, the ``economy`` is often used pejoratively. An article in The New York Times, for example, about a recent recession used these two headings: ""As Economy Suffers Big Hit, Recession Fears Spread."" and ""Dismal Data Send Recession Worries Spreading."" This same article in a British news media cited a new economist who said that ''Britain's faltering economy is going through the most severe recession in more than 60 years."" In USA Today, one of many news sources, it is said that ""Britain's economy takes a hit"" or that ""economy falters."" This sort of usage does not make economic concepts and policies clearer.

  News summarization from an article written during a recession would use fewer numbers and more adjectives to indicate a sharp slowdown in economic activity (""businesses are closing down and home foreclosures are rising""). This sort of"

According to the UN, more than 400,000 people have been killed since the beginning of its civil war in 2011 and over half of the country's population has been displaced. According to the UN, the Syrian government and its ally Russia are responsible for the majority of war-related deaths. The rebels accuse Russia of killing civilians in attacks on hospitals, while the government maintains that the rebels are responsible for civilian deaths in retaliation.

In June, the United States and the Russian-backed regime reached an agreement on the creation of four de-escalation zones that have halted the bombing in the three other zones. The agreement established zones held by the Syrian government, rebel groups and US-backed Kurdish forces that would effectively have separate zones of control. However, some of the main rebel groups, including Jabhat al-Nusra (previously known as al-Nusra Front), refused to abide by the agreement.

To put that into further context -- news (which includes financial and economic news) and sports (which also includes information about sports) are both covered by BBC Sports News.  In other words, the ""World's Fastest Golfers"" is a topic that should be covered by both news and sports.

I have a big mouth and people are starting to talk, and that’s all I’m going to say, but people are saying a lot of mean things to me, and dad doesn’t like me saying those mean things about people on the internet, he and you shouldn’t either.
So now I’m asking for your help.

Abstract

 2. The global economy is struggling due to COVID-19, geopolitical tensions, and climate change, leading to slower growth, supply chain issues, and increased inequality. Governments are countering these challenges with various support measures.

Summary

 3. This paper examines the extent to which the economic crisis caused by and resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities in global income and wealth. Two methods are used to quantify the impact of policy-related COVID-19 mitigation measures and the economic contraction on inequality. The results demonstrate that these measures reduce global income inequality to unprecedented levels, and that COVID-19 will result in the largest and deepest global recession since the Second World War.

Implications for policy"

It is not clear if the lawyers who have been teaching him will be able to obtain a divorce on the grounds that they would be unable to persuade their clients to separate after being represented by a robot.
The issue of Yoda's legal qualifications are expected to end up in the UK High Court and the European Court.

Governments are countering these challenges with various support measures. While there are signs of increased government spending, a major concern is the rising cost of debt and the ability of advanced economies to maintain fiscal surpluses. The current recession has been accompanied by sharp increases in inflation, threatening consumers, while government support packages are pushing up sovereign debt levels. There are major supply chain disruptions, and this is being exacerbated by rising costs for inputs.

The ""web2word"" example

Web2Word allows the user to use a plain-text sentence to compose a machine-readable sentence that will be used as input into an article rewriting system. The plain-text sentence is then processed by a system that converts it into a machine-readable sentence (which consists of a tokenized list of words) and that then uses that list of words to generate an article summary.

The system works by first dividing the plain-text sentence into a list of words. A list of tokens (the words of the sentence divided into words) is created. The system uses a tokenization algorithm that generates a list of word/token pairs (words separated by tokenizer) and a tokenizer table that holds a list of common words (called a stop"

The Dublin High Court ruling could open the way for more abuse victims to take claims to the UK courts, where the liability of the perpetrator is more likely to be determined.

The combined impacts of a global pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change have slowed economic growth considerably for both developed and developing economies, making it harder for lower-income families to afford basic necessities. Some governments are responding with a mix of fiscal stimulus, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth. Others are responding with a mix of policy measures to stimulate their economies during the downturn. The world’s largest economy, the United States, is moving quickly with an economic rescue bill that includes many policy measures aimed at alleviating the impact of COVID-19.

 Article: Over the last week the world has had the opportunity to hear from global leaders in Washington, New York, Beijing, Frankfurt, Zurich, Mumbai, Moscow, New Delhi and Brasilia. These world leaders made promises of financial and economic support to the developing world while the richest countries in the world struggled to put out their own fires. While the promises are good in intention, what happens to these promises at the end of the day if the developed world falls into recession? The IMF's annual meetings provided a lot of new insights into the world's most important global players and their thoughts about what to do to tackle economic inequality and what to do to support countries in the developing world.

Despite years of political effort and billions in climate finance, poor, developing countries are still struggling to adapt to the impact of climate change and remain vulnerable. This presents opportunities as well as a potential threat to the economic stability of developed countries, where most investment decisions are made. However, the increasing climate and natural hazard risks and the increasing climate vulnerability of developing countries are often taken into consideration without a full appreciation of the associated risks. In addition, climate risks are seen in terms of a global, cross-border problem which can be addressed by international institutions and national authorities. However, in the view of this article, developing countries' vulnerabilities should be viewed as closely intertwined with their economic structure. The vulnerability of developing countries, which are economically weaker, more vulnerable and economically weaker, is often neglected. As a result of this, the policies needed to address climate change for developing countries is often insufficient. This paper examines how these vulnerabilities create a more precarious position for countries and countries should be approached with a more comprehensive approach. The paper then highlights a few solutions adopted by developing countries such as China and the United States which are often not discussed in climate policy literature. These policies"

The world economy has been struggling for most of the past decade due to a number of headwinds but the COVID-19 pandemic and related disruptions have been a game-changer.
The shock to confidence has already started affecting economic activity. With many countries still in lockdown and many economies likely to come under severe strain in the months ahead, activity is likely to plummet even further before it starts to recover.
GDP for 2020 has been revised down to around -3 per cent, from the previous estimate of around -2.5 per cent.
For 2021 GDP is expected to grow, but at a slower pace than before.
In this context, an agreement between the US and China on the Phase-1 deal on 13 January is a positive step. The new agreement provides for a gradual rollback of tariffs and greater access to US markets for certain Chinese goods, and China has pledged to increase its purchases of US goods and services by roughly $200bn in 2021 and 2022, roughly doubling its pre-pandemic level. Such a deal could help to reduce the uncertainty affecting global investment.

According to the Financial Times, the move to reduce public spending would come amid growing fears in Whitehall over the prospect of a second wave of the pandemic in the winter.
The paper quoted a senior government figure on Tuesday saying that ""the budget is going to be a real problem"" because of the pandemic.
The move to curtail spending will lead to a rise in borrowing, putting more pressure on the government.
Mr Robinson said: ""We have to focus on the long term health and the economic health of this island and I don't see how that can be done if we don't have a stable community where people feel secure and secure in their jobs in whatever sector.""

But the global economic outlook could be undermined by heightened geo-political tensions such as the ongoing conflict between the US and China, or tensions in Ukraine, and a slowing global economy. Persistently high public debt levels and heightened inequality within countries are also putting pressure on national budgets to pursue policies that redistribute income to the poor and the working class. This is a recipe for potential political instability, social unrest and conflict in some cases, especially as climate change continues to exacerbate risks to social cohesion, as seen in Europe with the anti-immigration movements. The global economy is also showing signs of rebalancing, as demand improves in developed countries while inflation falls faster in advanced and emerging markets.

 Article: The first and the main question is whether the present-day media of the West are an echo chamber through which an individual is always heard in his own voice, or are they an open space through which he can interact with others? On the one hand, we have all seen reports in the mainstream press that claim that the media is an echo chamber through which people in the West are hearing and seeing nothing but their own views, and on the other, the media report that the Internet has enabled people to interact with one another as never before. Here are some observations by media theorist John Rennie and the British scholar-practitioner Richard Rorty.  Rennie  suggests that a fundamental problem with the electronic media is the fact that, whereas before radio and TV could only take in a signal (or a picture, depending on which medium was chosen for the purposes of the study), now one can download the material that one wishes"

Economic growth has slowed considerably across both developed and developing nations. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are exacerbating economic inequalities, making it harder for low-income families to afford basic necessities. Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth.
In the face of significant challenges, governments have responded with a mix of stimulus measures. Fiscal incentives, such as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, to prevent job losses and promote household livelihoods, have been well-received across global markets. Governments have also rolled out additional welfare benefits for low-income workers and students, and have provided wage subsidy schemes for small businesses.
However, the efficacy of these measures will depend on conditions in key markets and the effectiveness of implementation. This is particularly true for developing and emerging economies. Given the economic shock, further stimulus measures may be required to prevent bankruptcies from leading to wider financial distress. Other policy reforms such as increasing efficiency in service delivery and strengthening fiscal frameworks and institutions are also critical.
As governments implement policy measures, they will"

87001,1,"A number of countries, such as Greece and Turkey, are experiencing currency shortages because of a shortage of new banknotes and coins. In the last few years, the Greek central bank has been printing more and more banknotes to deal with the shortage. However, as this paper first pointed out in June 2015, the European Central Bank (ECB) is not allowing Greek banks to accept newly printed banknotes from the central bank in cash transactions. Instead, the Greek banks need to get currency from central banks in neighbouring countries and convert them into euros before they can be exchanged for cash. This is taking two to three days, at a significant cost. While the Eurosystem has continued to permit this situation to persist for the last one-and-a-half years, the ECB would prefer to encourage national central banks to move towards the more efficient cashless payments systems which will be a long-term objective of the Eurosystem. But it is still unclear if the Greek central bank and the banks in other countries will be willing to give their banks greater flexibility to accept newly printed banknotes and coins, especially if they want to take delivery of Greek banknotes and coins at a much discounted price (because they need to convert them into euros) before they can exchange them for"

The author is correct -- there are real problems with the summary. The problem is that the author didn't give the reader enough information to understand exactly what the problems were, or what it all added up to -- and whether any of it was actually relevant. This could have been communicated in less space while still saying the same thing, with less of a sense of ""here is the essence of the argument.""

For example, instead of displaying the summary in the above format, you may display a hyperlink to the article under ""more..."" that, when clicked, displays the related article (article 1), and below the article 1, a hyperlink to the related article (article 2), and so on.

We do not want to show any kind of a list or summary for every article. It is also important that the layout of articles do not get distorted when we display their summaries in this way.

Is there any way to display plain text without the use of a list or a summary?"

Many of the stimulus packages have been enacted based upon recommendations from the World Bank and the IMF. These plans may have positive and negative impacts on the global economy at large. In order to make sense of these plans, there are two general categories: the short term and the long-term. The short-term plans can be divided into a temporary, or `emergency,' period through 2024; and, any'sustained' long-term plans that might last through 2035 or beyond. The plan that applies to all countries in the world is the UNFCCC, with climate change as the main focus. The key points of that plan are that the world must reduce its CO2 emissions, and move to renewable energy. The UNFCCC has not been effective in achieving these goals. In fact, in 2009, in negotiations to make specific changes to the Copenhagen Accord based on the UNFCCC's Kyoto Protocol, climate change only made it into the second"

46728,2,"The Global Economy is Struggling under Tensions with China, Brexit, and Climate Change

Analysis:

This summary is quite interesting for investors to find out that some of issues that they are concerned about could be on the back burner. For example, the China issue has now been put on the back burner. The trade war is likely to continue for some more time before trade wars completely gets shelved. So, it is likely that the economy will still be affected by trade war for some more time. On the other hand, in May, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that the US economy has “weathered” trade tensions with China so there is no reason to believe that a trade deal would not be reached. So, the question arises as to whether trade war is likely to be shelved before the time of a new trade deal inked between the US and China?

We can think of a few questions. How long will trade tensions with China last? Could the tensions get out of control any time? What kind of policy measures does the US government propose to deal with the growing tensions with China? We have tried to understand all this only through this newspaper article with its summary.

Question:
Which of the mentioned issues"

This is just one example of the problems presented by summaries, which are meant to summarize an article for someone who didn’t want to spend the time reading the entire article. When they’re poorly managed (by newsrooms, editors or websites using them), they often present only a fragment of the article—or not the “full context,” as the article itself asserts.

This “crisis” is only a symptom of the much larger problem. Summaries are the output of a newsroom that can’t afford reporters, editors and other staff to fully investigate every story before it appears. If they had that money, they’d have reporters spend more time on the ground researching stories, more time interviewing sources for more depth, and they’d have a different newsroom culture altogether. As it is, there aren’t enough reporters to investigate all the stories journalists know are out there. Summaries are the inevitable result.

For journalists to fully understand the context and background of a story—what was discussed or reported in-depth that wasn’t included in a short summation—they"

14721,1,"The UK’s future in the EU hangs in the balance.” Prime Minister David Cameron’s government is considering a “reform” (or, more specifically, a “negotiation”) treaty that would set conditions for Britain’s relationship with the EU that go beyond membership (eg limiting freedom of movement across the EU’s borders).
It is likely that Cameron will ask the EU for a “Brexit”, a withdrawal from the EU. At present, the only referendum is to stay in vs leave, not to renegotiate the union; the government has said this will happen should they achieve a majority for withdrawal.
Cameron’s government has proposed that if he succeeds in renegotiating the EU to his liking, a referendum will be held the following year, in June 2016. The British have not voted to leave the EU, and there is a strong and vocal eurosceptic movement in the UK that opposes any change in membership status, such that Cameron might fail. In fact, the referendum in 2016 might be the wrong time to hold this referendum, if Cameron has failed to renegotiate.

This is despite years of government fiscal stimulus, including in the UK. This has helped to keep markets afloat, but has been supplemented by increasing public and private sector austerity measures. Rising inequality and low wages has also led to mass protests, and now this is leading to unrest on the streets - protests which have so far only been quelled by police. So will the world economy have another big shock in 2014?

This exercise illustrates my main criticism of the model, which is that it is too simple. It assumes that all information is available to the analysts. The analysts must also assume a uniform approach to analysis, which is not the case in reality.
The data and the data processing is, therefore, the key to the model. If you do not know anything about the data, then you cannot make any sensible analysis or recommendations – it is essentially a useless tool!
In addition, I find my model flawed on these points.

1. There is no explicit time dimension in the model. The COVID-19 pandemic that dominated the last two months of the simulation was the obvious focus of policymakers. It is not clear why this was not included. As a result, the model does not capture some of the important trends in the economy. The lockdowns and the restrictions on movement had a much more direct impact on the economy"

The growth rate contracted to -5.3% in 2020 [1] (from +2.9% in 2019), implying that the world avoided a global recession by only a few tenths of a percentage point. This level of economic deterioration was somewhat less than many analysts had modeled for. Many forecasters had anticipated a much sharper downturn, but the economy's resilience to the COVID-19 impacts has helped to avoid such a contraction. Economic recovery has begun in some regions since April 2020, but the recovery has been more gradual than some forecasters had expected. The overall recovery remains uncertain and subject to further policy uncertainties.

Methodology: This is a prospective study conducted in an outpatient department for patients undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Data of patients with CHF (chronic high-flow-rate) in the age group 65 years or older on stable angiography was analysed with the goal to identify a single best treatment method in order to reduce the total procedure cost. Data was analysed through the use of Monte Carlo simulations and data was obtained from a Monte Carlo model with the characteristics of the patients and treatment procedures. Results: 1 778 patients were considered in the analysis and 10 treatments were compared. Treatment effects were significant statistically. The difference in the total cost of treatment was observed in favour of a best-median treatment (MMT) which reduced the cost of treatment by 23.6% (95% confidence interval: 19.6 - 27.3).

Article: Sylvan Parry, 46, of Caernarfon, Gwynedd, denied trying to kill Fiona Parry on 3 September.
But a jury at Mold Crown Court found him guilty by a majority of 10 to two, on Thursday.
Judge Eleri Rees directed that jurors could give a majority verdict after two hours and 15 minutes of deliberations.
She added that Parry would be sentenced on Friday.
Mother-of-six, Mrs Parry, suffered life-changing injuries in the attack.
Speaking outside court, following the verdict, she said: ""I hope he does get a life sentence for what he has done to me.""

He's writing from a certain perspective, and is advocating a given course of actions.

In a sense, it is the most neutral: the article is objective. You don't find any opinions in the article. If you take the other views, you will get opinions that go through the same filter.

The author is a lobbyist. His arguments are completely subjective, and lack any basis in fact.

22232,3,"""Global economy faces unprecedented challenges"" ""Two thieves who ransacked a historic farm on two separate occasions have become the first in Britain to be handed ASBOs banning them from metal detecting. Peter Cox, 69, and Darren West, 51, were arrested in the summer when they were seen illegally digging trenches on the land at Chester Farm in Northamptonshire. The duo pleaded guilty to two counts of theft from a scheduled monument on December 19. They were each given 52-week suspended sentences and were ordered to pay £750 costs and £750 compensation. Under a special order, they will be forbidden from using metal detecting equipment for life. The pair were also issued with ASBOs preventing them from using metal detecting equipment. The coins they unearthed at the site are similar to the massive haul of 50,000 Iron Age items found in Jersey last year, the largest hoard of Celtic coins ever unearthed. Historic: Chester Farm was an important settlement throughout the Iron Age, Roman and mediaeval periods. Under the law of treasure trove, metal detectorists who uncover valuables on land owned by the government or a heritage body become responsible for those items, and are liable to face prosecution. Despite these issues, there were just 2.6 million metal detector users in Britain"

Thanks : I will definitely take a look at these. Are there any good web sites that give feedback on the quality of writing as opposed to just the readability and accessibility?

For this particular case, I think the main thing is knowing the word limits, as you're essentially summarising and condensing a 3-4,000 word long article into a very short paragraph.
The thing with a lot of those online tools is that you have to upload your text yourself, rather than the article having been scanned off the web. That probably reduces the accuracy of the tool by quite a margin, but I'm not entirely sure. I'm going to be quite surprised if one existed.

The world's worst drought in 50 years in the United States is adding to global food and fuel prices and has already caused millions of dollars worth of damage to crops. The drought will be a major factor in determining how quickly the world economy rebounds from the deepest recession since the Great Depression, World Bank Group President Robert Zoellick said on Thursday. The U.S. drought has taken a huge toll. Over the past three months, corn prices in the United States have jumped about 50 percent because of the poor growing conditions, according to trading house Zaner Group. The drought has also increased the cost of production for soybeans, dairy and meat prices globally. It is one of the worst droughts for corn and soybean crops on record in the United States because of extremely high temperatures, drought, soil-siltation and other factors.  The World Bank predicts the drought will cost global production of corn and wheat this year by up to 5 percent and reduce livestock feedstock supplies by 3 to 4 percent"

As for ""supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures,"" the article does cite a supply chain disruption in the supply of N95 face masks, and the article explains the problem of inflated costs for such products by a lack of transparency in the market, as prices are determined in part by what ""other hospitals were charging, what suppliers were willing to pay, and how long a hospital could keep goods on hand if it was having trouble finding supplies"

Article : Jeffrey Richman. PUBLISHED:. 05:36 EST, 12 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 09:24 EST, 14 November 2012. After a devastating Superstorm Sandy hit the New York area last month, utility companies have been sending residents back bills that seem more surprising than usual. The Long Island Power Authority, for example, sent customers two November bills with full estimated charges, though none of the customers had any electric service or hot water for a full two-week period in the middle of the bill cycle. One customer, who does not wish to be identified, got two bills – the first one totaling $649, but"
51871,1,"A new report by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate says governments have to change course now and take bold action to limit global warming. It says some of the actions needed include an immediate end to coal-fired power plants, an overhaul of building codes, and government incentives aimed at rapidly expanding high-efficiency transportation. The study, released Thursday, says governments also need to create public policies aimed at increasing the value of nature, investing in water treatment and sanitation and helping small businesses transition to clean energy.'"".

Article body copy :  “The climate has always changed. The fact that our emissions are changing is not new news. We are in fact seeing a period of profound climate change. We, of course, have always known that fossil fuel emissions cause climate change. But the question is how big a change the climate is going to have in any given year. And our results conclude that it’s going to be much bigger than we expect.”

As part of the study, a large group of former and current finance ministers, central bankers and financial regulators from around the world were interviewed.

Governments across the world are trying to meet this challenge with a varied mix of fiscal and monetary responses. Fiscal stimulus measures include stimulus packages that provide additional expenditures to households and businesses as well as tax relief measures. In recent months, several central banks, including the Bank of Canada, Bank of England, and the Federal Reserve have eased monetary policy by cutting policy rates and expanding asset purchase programs. Governments are also expanding social programs and introducing direct aid packages for households and businesses. While these measures are welcome, they are limited in scope and effectiveness, especially since many of them do not provide specific support to low income households.

Explanation 1: A summary is a condensed version of the article in question. In order to include all the relevant facts regarding the subject's area of expertise and the topic in question, summaries are always presented before the body text in an academic publication.

Explanation 2: Articles are usually made up of many smaller pieces that relate to a particular subject. Thus each article usually comes with a summary of the subject's areas of expertise, as stated in its title and abstract. If these sections are not included in a paper, there is no need for an academic journal to include a summary.

Hundreds of amateur treasure hunters flocked to a beach at Folkestone, Kent earlier today in a bid to get their hands on a share of the solid gold deliberately buried in the sand. Excited children with their parents, hobby archeologists and competitive teens packed the beach at low tide to try and find the hidden bullion. Scroll down for video. Some treasure hunters believe that using a bigger shovel is the most effective way of finding the gold. While others have been digging in a more delicate and controlled manner akin to archaeology.

The Paris attacks, which targeted multiple sites throughout the city but specifically focused on the area around the Stade de France stadium, were part of a series of extremist terror attacks that have taken place at the same time. As a result, and due to the COVID-19 pandemic, travel restrictions have limited the number of participants at the summit. Security was ramped up, with helicopters flying overhead and roads in the area sealed off. The summit, which typically includes several dozen heads of state gathered to discuss matters such as the global economy, is more focused on the aftermath of the terror attacks and the future of climate change and diplomacy than the economy. The attacks, which targeted a rock concert, a café, and a stadium during Paris' Bastille Day celebrations, killed 130 people and wounded hundreds more. French"

2. In this backdrop of a global economic recession, the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated existing economic inequalities and created new socio-economic divides. Low-income workers and the self-employed have been particularly affected. Global supply chains have been disrupted with severe consequences for health-care workers, agricultural producers, and those in the gig economy. In this context of economic uncertainty, many are now fearing job losses.

3. On the climate change front, policymakers and economists have warned of the grave impact of the pandemic on climate change and the need to mitigate its effects. A recent report by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) warned that the coronavirus pandemic will delay the economic recovery, as the health crisis will also have serious negative ramifications"

It is easy enough to get a feel for what is going on here. The pandemic, COVID19, led the world to take the unprecedented move of shutting down the largest economic engine, the U.S. to reduce health care costs, but it also led to a sharp economic slump. The United Kingdom as well has already taken drastic action with one of the smallest populations in the world, and at a much smaller scale than the U.S.
Tensions led to trade wars between the world’s biggest economies. Even when the trade wars were not heating up the climate change led to the fires in Australia.

If this is a summary, then this is a very incomplete one. The only thing this summary really lets you know is there is a pandemic going on. The biggest problem with summaries is that they must give you all the high level information in the most economical way possible. Unfortunately this leads to the kind of summary above becoming ‘facts’ rather than something only believed by people with a desire"

 Article: The coronavirus pandemic could push millions into poverty by the end of 2021, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, a leading study finds. It says that the pandemic will push nearly 60 million into poverty, which it defines as earning less than $5.50 per day. Nearly half of these will be in Sub-Saharan Africa. This is in part linked to weaker growth, due to high government debt, and a sharp drop in remittances, as well as high food prices, the International Monetary Fund says, which means that the poor will either need external aid or, the World Bank's preferred scenario, take loans and food vouchers.

The Act will update the existing rules and will ensure that new online services are able to be offered in Europe. Companies will be asked to provide more information regarding the responsibilities of the operator of the platform. This will be necessary for national authorities to know who is behind a certain digital service. The rules will strengthen the rights of citizens and publishers, to protect their personal, private, and editorial content from misuse by certain companies. And it would also reinforce the responsibility of social media platforms: the social media companies – online platforms – are called upon to improve their transparency and their data handling practices. If the proposed proposal is adopted it would be possible, for instance, that a service provider like a Google or Facebook, to whom the user has given access to personal data and content, could be held responsible for how the user has used that information.

 The plain-text summary sentence of the article above with URLs or lists is :  ```The global economy is... facing unprecedented challenges and... increasing... inequality.```

 If one article has an overall positive value (above one) the other one must have value below one.  However, this only holds if the positive article has an article value above one, in which case a positive article with an article value below one will raise another article with an article value above one.

The simplest way is to use the scorecard below, which is based on the simple fact that the article or article series should always have an overall positive score and the summarily sentence(s) of another article should have an overall negative score.

Example

Suppose we want to determine the overall value of the article with the positive value:

```Economy grows faster than expected... `

 If the sum of the summarily sentences of all the articles about the economy has an overall negative value (below zero), then the positive article should have a value above one. If the article series with the positive value is below the article series by an overall value, it must"

The answer being  -- The problem is that  ""Economic growth has slowed considerably"" and that, ``Economic inequalities, making it harder for low-income families to afford basic necessities"" is ambiguous.

The resultant unprecedented global response will have repercussions on the near-term economic outlook. In addition, geopolitical tensions are rising, particularly between the United States and China with the latter potentially using a carbon tax to further exacerbate the geopolitical tensions.

66094,3,"The Global Economic Outlook
Summary
The global economy continues to recover from the COVID-19 shock, and growth in 2021 is projected to pick up to 6.6 percent from 4.2 percent in 2020. However, this recovery, while impressive, will be uneven, and it is expected to be dominated by relatively larger advanced economies - where vaccine deployments are well under way - with some support from a recovery in developing countries.
Output in advanced economies rebounds from the 4.0 percent contraction witnessed in 2020, to grow at 5.9 percent in 2021, mainly reflecting a strong fiscal outlook and continued support for activity through the extension of government support schemes. However, the expansion is also driven by pent-up demand, a relaxation of containment measures, improved market sentiment, and a fiscal impulse.
The recovery in emerging market and developing economies accelerates from an expected 3.3 percent expansion in 2020 to 7.1 percent in 2021. The projected rise in advanced economies, together with a pick-up in economic activity across many emerging markets, provides a key impetus. This should help to offset some of the negative spillovers from recent increases in global debt, particularly among the largest emerging market economies from rising US yields. Moreover, the easing of domestic financial conditions and the"

17638,4,"Globalization and industrial revolution have made life easier for humans but have also affected natural resources. Economic and industrial progress, but at a cost: environmental issues.
There are many ways to look at environmental issues, but we will focus on two specific questions concerning the future of the environment. First, global warming and the impact it may have on human welfare; second, energy production and energy consumption.
Global warming is already being experienced by humans, caused by the emission of greenhouse gases, and will become a significant problem with the rapid increase in the consumption of energy in all its forms.
The most common way to address this issue is to look at the current state of energy production and consumption.
Energy Production
Nowadays, more than half of the energy currently consumed is used for heating homes and/or industrial applications. The second-most commonly used energy is used in transport, for example, cars, trains and planes.
Energy consumption increases with the increasing prosperity of living standards, and currently almost a third of the population in industrialized countries (that is, about two billion people) live in places that are very hot or cold, with no natural shelter from the harsh weather.
This creates a major problem: more and more people are being forced to migrate in search of"

The coronavirus crisis is a major factor behind the worsening global economic outlook according to the World Bank and OECD, which released their latest forecast on Tuesday.
The OECD said the UK economy could slump by 9.5% this year as coronavirus keeps a lid on trade and business activity.
Fears are growing that a no-deal Brexit at the end of the current transition period would mean a significant dent in the economy.
Even with a deal, the UK would still have to adapt to new export rules with the rest of the European Union. That would be a ""severe blow"" at a time where businesses were already battling severe supply chain problems due to the ongoing pandemic.

 * Note * The following question is about a more general question on why summaries are so important for the human mind.  Summaries are important to the human mind because the human mind tends to prefer quick, low-overhead information, and summaries tend to deliver both quickly and with minimal effort.  I know you will say that human minds already have mechanisms that allow them to receive information quickly and with the minimum resources.  But perhaps you are wrong; perhaps the human mind needs summaries so that it can ""save energy"" (or, as psychologists would have it, ""exercise energy"").

Article: In what sounds like a scene from an action movie, more than 100 masked gunmen stormed one of Mexico’s largest power plants on Friday and held the staff for an hour, demanding they turn back fuel deliveries to power the country during the pandemic. It was the second such attack in a week. It came at a time the government is trying to restart the economy, which has collapsed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The incident occurred early Friday at a plant in Zacatecas, just north of Mexico City, said Mario del Valle, a manager for state electrical power company CFE. The plant has fuel to run its boilers for five more days — about the length of time the government says the crisis will continue.

Question: how reliable is the quoted article in the sentence above?

Answer:

1. First of all, the quoted sentence comes in the body of the article as a list (it needs to be bold, underlined, and with double quotes). The information it contains is taken directly from the article. This means that it belongs to this article, not to the summarizing sentence above.

2. The quoted sentence is quite a long list, including a verb, which is not usually found in sentences used for summaries. Such long lists should be regarded with caution.

3. The quoted sentence does contain a comma that should not be there. This is a fatal source of error.

The information given in the sentence may have been correct, but the information given in the summarizing sentence is often wrong.

4. The quoted section of text contains an explicit link to a link"

Now, as to the analysis you proposed.
- The article seems to summarize a number of issues. Some of the issues are related to business, some are related to the local economy, some are related to the global economy --- all are problems that many of us are familiar with. If you could have this article summarized to one sentence, it would be something like ""The global economy is facing difficult challenges due to the combined impact of COVID-19, geopolitical tensions, and climate change,"" right?
- The article is short. The amount of information given in the article is basically the bare bones. You could probably summarize that to a paragraph of text. So, the statement to that effect is actually true, although it's misleading, because the article doesn't tell us any details about those challenges.

The summary I think is what the mainstream media or the official sources give out when they report on the global economy.

The global economy entered a recession in the first quarter of 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic, the oil price shock and social unrest severely impacted economic activity across the globe. GDP in the G20 fell by 3.3 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund, the largest decline since the recession caused by the global financial crisis in 2008. Despite massive monetary and fiscal stimulus, the recession is likely to be the second longest in economic history after 1930-1933. In order to mitigate the impacts of the crisis, policymakers have announced a combined fiscal and monetary stimulus of over 10 trillion US dollars in total. However, this fiscal push alone will not be enough to turn economic sentiment around, especially in times of an unprecedented public health crisis. Countries are also facing the twin challenges of mitigating rising unemployment and protecting vulnerable households. Governments are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth. For developing economies, however, fiscal and monetary policy support is needed to reduce pressure on households.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has estimated that the world economy will be recovering in 2021, but the rate of growth will be only 3.2 percent and not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2023. This economic contraction has led to unemployment rising in industrialized countries. US unemployment grew in April to 13.3 percent. This is the highest rate over the last 30 years.

 What I am curious about is how do we get the original article in plain text from the web page in the web browser.
I thought it would be easy but apparently not.

Do you have a copy from a screenshot or a link to a mirror-site? If you do, we could get around it by manually reformatting the links so that they are no longer clickable.

The problem is that, when reading the article through one of the news reader, there is a header at the top of the page that links directly to the original article in plaintext.
So I need to get the link to the article as it was on the original website without the original website knowing about it.

The need for fundamental reform of the world economy, trade, and the governance of finance is becoming apparent. The pandemic has also underscored the importance of governments investing in human capital, strengthening social protection systems, and creating economic policies that support the inclusion of more people into the economic mainstream. While governments must be at the forefront of any fundamental change, the responsibility for driving change to the benefit of all rests with the international community. The G20 is in a unique position to take a lead in this area. However, in order to be effective, its reform agenda must be both inclusive and transformatively ambitious. The G20 summit in November will allow the G20 to take the lead in building a better future for all. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank now make an important contribution to the economic and social agenda.

Among the British competitors, the most successful Paralympian of all time is swimmer Hannah Cockroft, who won a staggering 10 gold medals, as well as 11 world records, at London 2012.
She will be attempting to repeat the feat at Rio, where she is ranked as second in the global race for the women’s 100m butterfly. However she is not the only double Paralympian in the line-up – she will be teaming up with Jonnie Peacock, her partner in the men’s 100m and 200m freestyle, for the first time in their careers.
Also of British interest this year is para-equestrian rider Katie-George Dunlevy, who is the favourite for gold at the individual dressage competition.
Dunlevy took up the sport after losing most of her vision in one eye, and since then won a world championship medal in dressage as part of Great Britain's team.

Yeah, this is how I'd like to do most work with my students.

I wonder if people's attention spans are slowly getting shorter?

I think this is a case-by-case thing. I am not an expert but I don't think we read a paper for the content, but for the format. A lot of people would probably read a paper anyway on-line if it's just as readable.

That's exactly what I think as well, and that is the problem. I've found that many people prefer reading through a paper to an online version."

Under what circumstances would you select the plain-text summary sentence in order to ensure that your users will not be distracted by the external links.

The main problem I have found for the answer is that the summary sentence is a link. The answer requires that users click on the external link to get to the plain-text summary of the article. However, my users would not be willing to click on the link. I don't know whether I should ask them to click on the summary first OR on the links (which, incidentally, they often do while reading the articles).

Given the given article summary, I would select the text directly, but I agree with darthviking's comment that this may not always be the best response to the task of minimizing the user distraction."

 A Brief History
In the early 1980s a conference on the future of computing was organised in Waterloo Station, London. It was attended by academics, IT companies, government officials and computer hobbyists. Some interesting conversations occurred, but nothing of great significance was ever achieved.
Fast-forward to the new millennium, and we’re still seeing the fruits of this discussion: Linux is widely used, cloud computing is all the rage, and we’re still in a ‘hacker mentality’.
Today, we’re at a similar crossroads: IT companies are building hardware and software, programmers are working hard writing code, and we�"

  Fiscal stimulus.
  Fiscal policy in response to the pandemic has been unevenly designed across all G20 economies.
  Governments have responded with additional spending, tax relief, subsidies, and payments to their citizens.
  However, most support will expire over coming months and, once their balance sheets rebalance, interest payments are unlikely to be covered by tax revenues.
  Fiscal stimulus needs to be sustained through 2021 in order to ensure a gradual rebound in economic output.
  Monetary policy in response to the crisis has so far been loose.

Example 2 :
The US-China trade war is still unfolding: it is going on for two years, with neither side willing to budge. As you're sure to have heard by now, Donald Trump was one of the most vocal critics of these tariffs, not only threatening to go to the mat with China, but also suggesting an end to trade with other countries. His administration has now started talks with Beijing, and while they are not over, both sides appear to be willing to sit down and talk, which certainly has never happened before. Some countries have also agreed on new tariffs against their Chinese counterparts, such as Canada, Australia, and Japan.
However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the tariffs' impact is not quite as serious as its critics had first assumed...
As it stands now, the most recent round of tariffs put on hundreds of billions of dollars of consumer goods like smartphones, computers, and toys seems to have little effect on the price of those products, much unlike what we saw in the summer. However, even if that ends up being the case, we know that these"

Summary: There has been a massive increase in people losing their jobs this year. In July 2009, before the global economic crisis, the number of jobless in the US was 11.2 million, according to the US Labor Department. This year, that number is already 32.6 million. The number of employed dropped from 156 million on the same date, 2007, before the crisis hit, to 146 million in July 2014 but to just 142.6 million a year later. There has been an even bigger change in the labor market for young people. The number of people aged from 25 to 34 who were in full-time employment dropped between 2007 and 2008, but then rose by 11 million, then fell by 5 million last year. So far this year, 2.3 million more Americans have lost their jobs than at the same point last year. For the young people who are still in the labor market, unemployment is rising, and new jobs are not as plentiful as they were a decade ago.

Opposition leaders and many analysts believe that establishing a no-fly zone will make it far easier for the United States to arm rebel forces, which would open the door to greater military involvement in the crisis, but it would also be costlier and riskier. 'There is a clear sense that the administration is coming to the conclusion that we would do much better to back a no-fly zone, and do whatever we can to train and arm the opposition,' said David Sedney, a former assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs in the Clinton administration. 'The problem is how to get the buy-in of the European coalition partners and even our Arab allies.' The administration also faces a daunting political hurdle. The American public, still uncertain about the need for troops to intervene in Syria, is likely to reject any attempt by Mr. Obama to wage battle in the region without a broad public mandate. The proposal to arm the rebels may rely on creating a no-fly zone that would protect opposition fighters and civilians from Syrian government aircraft.

The proposal to arm the rebels may rely on creating the no-fly zone that would protect the armed opposition and refugees from Syrian government aircraft. An area stretching 25 miles into Syria could be enforced with planes flown from neighboring Jordan. The idea is opposed by the rebels and Russia, Syria's main arms supplier and ally, and the Obama administration has not formally presented the proposal to President Barack Obama. The US has presented the idea as a 'Plan B' that could be used if diplomatic efforts fail, the Washington Post said. It comes after the UN failed to end violence in Syria at a meeting in Geneva last week, and after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad claimed his forces had killed more than 1,000 rebels. But opposition leaders believe an international weapons effort would give them weapons they have failed to get on the black market.

European ministers of finance and economy met on Wednesday. Greece was to put forward an initiative that would revive its southern EU neighbors via a fund to be financed by European Union members which had done best in the health crisis and by money from the European Investment Bank.
The Greek proposal is for a €50 billion fund over one and a half years, which would include €30 billion in grants and €20 billion in loans.
The Marshall Plan launched after World War Two to recover from the ravages of the war, the plan was meant to help Western Europe recover. The idea for the EU is to avoid anything similar from happening again. The new plan follows an already implemented Marshall Plan that has pumped billions of euros into the economy of Greece. It should be noted that the Greek recovery plan is not expected to come up against competition for EU funds.

Article: The global economy has been hit by COVID-19 due to  and geo-political tensions.
Governments are responding by offering social and fiscal safety nets and policies aimed at stabilising markets and fostering sustainable growth.
COVID-19 has had a debilitating effect on the world economy and threatens to inflict the deepest global recession since the 1930s.
There are indications the world economy could contract sharply this year and rebound modestly in 2021.
This suggests the road to recovery may be longer.
The global economy already was slowing before the pandemic struck, and has now been hit hard by a confluence of factors.
The US-China trade war has escalated over the past year, leading to tariffs, counter-tariffs, and other restrictions on trade.
This has affected investment and employment, which have taken a toll on consumption.
Inflation has picked up, as food prices have risen rapidly in many emerging markets.
Fiscal stimulus measures in advanced economies have dampened the impact of this.
But this aid has not been sufficient to prevent a slump in global economic growth to levels not recorded since the 1930s Great Depression.
The crisis has hit many advanced economies, although less severely than during the global"

The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. Economic growth has slowed considerably across both developed and developing nations. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are exacerbating economic inequalities, making it harder for low-income families to afford basic necessities. Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth. While the immediate priority has been to provide economic support to affected populations, it is now crucial that recovery strategies address the structural weaknesses and vulnerabilities that have been exposed. Without this, the economic impacts may be long-lasting.

However it is far from clear from the article that the proposed promotion is appropriate for Easter 2020. The article gives little insight into how the product would contribute towards the wellbeing of Easter 2020 consumers and is only concerned with promoting the concept.

  Article: Pot Noodles are not cheap – so are you likely to buy them this Easter? ‘You can get them on offer for 50p, but will I bother?’, the question is posed, and after a moment’s thought, perhaps “No”. The author then goes on to list the ingredients of a Pot Noodle. ‘Oh,’ I say to myself. ‘If something tastes better than it should, we’re likely to have to look at the ingredients.’ As the author informs us that Pot Noodles have “dietary fibre for a healthy start to the day”, I think “Right, but does a Pot Noodle really fill you up?”, but the journalist goes on to repeat the brand’s assertion that a"

Article: Dolly the cloned sheep was born in a laboratory this week for the second time in the hope that this time she will survive. Dolly was cloned for the first time in August 2005 from an existing sheep named Eileen, using donated genetic material from another sheep, Dolly's mother. She is now 14 years old. The idea of cloning is to clone just a small part of an animal to produce the animal needed. Dolly's father, who died last year aged 26, had a genetic disorder that meant he was likely to have been born dead. Researchers hope cloning can provide new sources of animal DNA for scientific research.  In this case however, it will be the complete sheep or llama. Cloning is not expected to be used widely for livestock in the near future.

''Globalisation will be undermined by the pandemic,
''Geopolitical tensions and climate change will intensify global problems,
''Bold and innovative government policy is needed to improve people's lives.''

Summary:  The basic requirements of our human health and longevity are air, water, and sunlight. Most people think of these in terms of climate, geography -- in other words, globalisation that has affected people in different places differently, and sometimes dramatically. But climate can include air, as well as water. Water is an integrated part of water pollution. The pollution could be due to pollution by pesticides, by fertilizers, and by nutrients in the water, but could also be simply from overuse -- by people who don't use it or abuse it. Pesticide-producing states are likely to use the pesticides less, because of the political costs, and fertilizer-producing states will use more because of the economic costs. Overuse of water is a big issue in Brazil, and that's likely to get worse.

For the most part, however, the problems are not global but local. For example, in China some of the big problems have been water pollution and the growing food needs of more people there"

In particular cities have focused on the use of technology to boost the security and surveillance of the city by using sensors to collect information on the volume of people on the street and on traffic flow in urban areas. In this regard, the project aimed at the use of an unmanned vehicle mounted with a surveillance camera, equipped with a network for the transmission of images and data to the network of control centres throughout the city, to monitor all points of the control and command network. The vehicle can drive for over 24 hours without requiring any human intervention. Its use in the urban street will allow the city manager to obtain valuable information on the use and movement of people in the city, thus allowing the management of public transport. It’s clear that for the coming years technology will play an increasingly important role in the daily life of society.

Article: Scientists from the University of East Anglia (UEA) say the device - the size of a USB stick - can detect bacteria directly from urine samples four times more quickly than traditional methods.
The technology could lead to faster treatment and better use of antibiotics, they say.
The findings were unveiled at a medical conference in San Diego.
Prof David Livermore, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said there was a need to move beyond the current ""carpet-bombing"" approach to treating urinary tract infections (UTIs).
""The way to do so lies in accelerating laboratory investigation, so that treatment can be refined earlier, benefitting the patient, who gets an effective antibiotic, and society, whose diminishing stock of antibiotics is better managed,"" he said.
The device can also detect resistance to antibiotics, said Dr Justin O'Grady, also from UEA's Norwich Medical School.

35044,2,"The global economy was struggling to remain on a course of robust growth before the COVID-19 pandemic. But this global threat from the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated many weaknesses in the world economy and it is slowing down even the strongest economies in the world. The economic disruptions associated with Covid-19 have disrupted supply chains and created supply shortages. There is inflationary pressure, and businesses and governments will try to reduce costs. These disruptions and tensions are threatening global peace and security and hence the global economy. In addition to the health crisis, we have a major climate crisis in which carbon emissions are rising and causing climatic changes. Add to all these three, multiple regional trade tensions caused by US-China, France-UK, and Japan-South Korea trade crises. With these multiple risks, the world economy is facing major challenges as it struggles to keep up the pace of growth and avoid the possibility of global recession. In the midst of these challenges, emerging and developing economies could lose much of their growth momentum due to the contraction of global trade and capital flows. In this context, the key question is whether this world economy will be able to recover or fall back into a recession.``` -- Full Article"
35044,3,"The global economy is faced with unprecedented challenges from the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, climate change, and the need to find more effective ways of treating serious infections, such as those caused by drug-resistant bacteria. Growing inequality in the global economy and geopolitical tensions are particularly problematic in terms of maintaining the viability of the global economy. The combined impact of these factors increases the urgency for economic policies to provide incentives to stimulate growth, and for governments to work together to protect the health and safety of their citizens. The impact of climate change also exacerbates these risks, particularly from the perspective of rising sea levels threatening coastal property and threatening agricultural production. Climate change should be addressed, to mitigate the threat of more frequent and intense natural disasters and to provide the means of better planning for adaptation. The global economy thus has serious problems that are likely to continue to grow in importance in the coming years. Policymakers should take note of these challenges and begin to devise and adopt policies aimed at addressing them.```

9325,1,"A virus has been spreading throughout the planet since 2011, and so far it has been too successful for scientists to stop it. In this age of globalization, there is almost certainly a single person behind the entire outbreak. Yet, despite its global reach and deadliness, this virus has remained anonymous. The Global Virus Strike Force has no leads on who started the outbreak and how it has been spreading worldwide, but every day brings new developments.
Scientists have been able to track the path of the virus through DNA, but they are starting to run out of genetic material, and the virus mutates too quickly to keep up. The virus is also changing how it interacts with DNA, further complicating the search.
Without genetic material to analyze, scientists believe the virus that has become common in every country on Earth is essentially random. In fact, it is just as likely to show up in a rural farm in Nebraska or a small city in Pakistan as it is to show up in downtown Manhattan or in Times Square.
Because the virus does not have any specific characteristics, the scientists do not yet have a pattern of how it spreads from person to person. They are aware of the common factors that the virus seems to affect most frequently, but they still do not know which ones. Once"

14060,1,"Summary: Economic activity worldwide had already slowed significantly before the unprecedented disruption wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted governments to take swift action to provide targeted relief amid growing financial markets turbulence. The measures, though, have been highly uneven, raising concerns that the effects could worsen already high economic inequalities. A prolonged recession could create a further sharp increase in food insecurity and hunger among families that do not have sufficient income to cover household expenses. Such a development could lead in turn to deteriorating social conditions and increased levels of crime, conflict, and violence.

I prefer the simple version (brief version). The reason is that I spend more time and have shorter attention span. For me the simple version gives me an overview quickly as if it was explained orally. It works well for me.

Economists have warned that the world economy could fall by as much as 6% of GDP with a best estimate of 3% (according to the International Monetary Fund), and the virus is showing no signs of subsiding according to the IWGS Global Economic Prospect (GEP). Countries around the world are trying to address the COVID-19 crisis with social distancing policies such as lockdowns and school closures. For example, in the US and Canada, government lockdowns prevented more than 50% of the workforce from working in March. For countries that have been affected by the virus or where the population has already been infected, fiscal stimulus measures are necessary to prevent a complete collapse of the economy. Economic policies that have been put in place by governments so far include business bailouts, unemployment programs, stimulus packages, and loan guarantees.
Some countries started to take measures and restrictions as early as February. Some of these measures include closing schools and places of worship in Canada and Italy, as well as canceling public and social events in France and Spain.

19650,2,"(AP) -- In 2008, the world financial crisis left many nations in a deep slump. Argentina was no exception.
Now, though, it is on the upward swing. The economy, the second-largest in South America, grew about 30% last year.
The economy is still small enough, however, that its successes will not be felt widely. One reason: Most Argentines can't afford to travel abroad, or can't invest in their country of origin because the peso has lost more than half its value since the end of 2008.
More than 14 million Argentines are now out of work. But with unemployment so high, many of Argentina's workers are being lured by jobs in more robust economies beyond its borders.
And not just men: With its relatively strong economy, Argentina has seen a rise in the number of women doing the jobs of traditional men, including construction.
The rising labor participation rate is likely to help boost productivity. With women taking on more jobs, more Argentines with some education are trying new careers.

The U.S. and Europe face growing debt burdens and rising inequality. Economic growth has slowed in major European nations and in Japan.

Policy-makers have the tools to address these challenges; however, the recovery will be very uneven and require greater investment in infrastructure and social services and more equitable distribution of income.```

Article: The global economy is slowing considerably amid a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and geopolitical tensions, which have all affected the livelihood of people. Low-income workers in emerging and developing economies are being hit the hardest by these forces, making it almost impossible for them to afford basic necessities while simultaneously paying for their children's education. In this article, we discuss three areas where countries should concentrate their focus in order to make an impactful difference in these vulnerable populations. First, we examine the need to address these economic challenges through the creation of more effective social protection systems in developing and emerging countries. Second, we explore the need to use alternative business models to better support these populations. And lastly, we address the need to strengthen institutions through the establishment of policies meant to strengthen the capacity of civil society to engage in development research and advocacy.

The summary text should ideally be based on verifiable facts, and the primary source should be verifiable as well. It is a fairly common practice to quote the primary source without the summary, which is fine.
The key here is that the main body of the text describes a claim, and the primary source description of the claim in the main body of the text is sufficient if it is verifiable.
You are supposed to avoid quoting the primary source to verify the same claim. (That way, the reader will have to go to the source to get the same information, which is the preferred route for verification.)

4259,0,"In the final hours of the transfer deadline, the United States government agreed late Sunday to stop a new trade war with China, leaving an earlier round of tariffs in place but postponing a new round until September 2020.
Tariffs will remain at the current rate of 15% on more than $75 billion worth of Chinese imports, while levies of 25% will be reimposed later in September on about $160 billion in Chinese-made goods.
It means roughly two-thirds of all Chinese products in the US will be affected.
President Trump has yet to formally sign off on the agreement, though the US and China had earlier indicated that he has no plans to veto the deal, negotiated by the US Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, and his Chinese counterpart, Liu He.
```We're getting everything we want,"" said Mr Trump on Friday.

  ```The world is facing unprecedented challenges due to the recent rise in tensions between countries across the globe. Economic growth has slowed significantly across both the developed and developing countries. This downturn has led to a significant rise in unemployment rate, widespread poverty, and a steep increase in global inequality. Governments around the world are responding with a mix of fiscal austerity, economic stimulus, and policy reforms. However, many of these measures are insufficient in mitigating the impact of this recession. Government support is not enough to keep businesses running, workers employed, and households afloat. As such, we believe that more needs to be done to strengthen economies not just in the developing world, but also in the developed world.   As the COVID-19 pandemic has put a sharp focus on the fragility of global supply chains as well as the importance of interdependence, governments ought to start thinking about how they can support the growth of their local economies through strategic and integrated planning. In particular, they must ensure that the economic stimulus packages are distributed fairly, particularly to those who need it the most.   One place to start is by adopting policies that aim to ensure that all communities, localities, and states alike"

  Dyson's patent claims are that it has come up with a new type of vacuum cleaner or ""hard floor cleaner with integrated mop"", as some British people used to call these things, that is useful for cleaning hard floors -- especially hard floors without a scrubber head. Dyson's patent claims are that it has come up with a 'cleaning head' that can be used with the existing vacuum cleaner, and can also be used with its new hard floor cleaner without the vacuum component. This patent claim is a little less impressive than the claim that it has invented the vacuum in the first place, which is a bit like saying that I have invented the mop in the first place. In that case I would be able to patent just about any 'cleaning head','machine with a cleaning head','mop' and 'cleaning head with a non-vacuum cleaning head' which uses a combination of the other components.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities, notably in supply chains, global trade, foreign direct investment, and capital flows. The economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to be significant, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimating a global recession of around 4 percent of GDP for 2020. Political and geopolitical uncertainty are adding to these risks, with the United States and China clashing over the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the United Kingdom and the European Union negotiating Brexit. Climate risk and geopolitical tensions have increased further, exacerbating long-standing vulnerabilities and undermining the competitiveness of many economies. In these conditions, fiscal stimulus and policy support, both public and private, are needed to safeguard growth.

12006,4,"The former Liberal Democrat leader Lib Dem candidate Derek Scott announced he will stand down after a year in Parliament.
Derek has been an MSP since the 2015 Scottish General Election, sitting in the Scottish Conservative parliamentary group. This caused some disquiet within the party as the Tories have a small but vocal contingent of Scottish nationalists who dislike the presence of Liberals in the group.
Lib Dem parliamentary groups have been a source of internal contention since David Steel was the leader of the party. Lib Dem MSPs, like all other MSPs, have to adhere to the same party rules as Conservatives; however, they are considered more sympathetic to anti-Scottish-rebellion sentiments as a consequence. As a result, it is not unusual for members of different groups to cross over to each others´s group to vote against the policy preferences (and perhaps more importantly, to vote for opposition amendments) of their respective groups.
A recent precedent for this occurred prior to the 2021 Holyrood election, when a significant number of Tories, including Derek Scott, crossed across to the Lib Dems to vote against the SNP plans to grant further devolution and against the SNP´s stance during the last years of the independence referendum debate.

 Is the summary longer than the original text of the article or does it contain facts that simply don’t appear in the original version of the article (or did not at the time of the submission)? If it is longer, was there more than one author? A single author submitting a document to SONAP would be counted under the same count as if that same document was submitted in its entirety.[20] If the original article was published in a PDF document, we would count its PDF version, since this gives us at least the same level as what the actual text of document was, and could contain more than one author, if multiple authors were present.[21]

To be counted multiple authors must have had different roles on the article, and the roles would need to be clearly identified. For example, if a team of reporters wrote an article, then any person on the team that also has a role of a fact checker, would also be counted as a fact"

  Article: The U.S. has begun screening people returning to the country from Africa for Ebola as fears deepen that the deadly virus may be transmitting within a community. NBC reports that the screenings at airports in Atlanta, Houston, and New York are seen as a first step toward preventing the virus from spreading across the United States, since two nurses from Liberia, who cared for a West African man who became the first person in the U.S. to die of the disease, have been tested positive for the disease. Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers of Disease Control, said that the nurses were not exhibiting Ebola symptoms to the point where they could have spread the disease to someone else. He explained: 'One of the nurses had limited contact with the disease; there is no indication they contracted Ebola from anyone else.' Traveling nurses who have been involved with the care of Ebola patients in West Africa would receive special screening, he added.

36155,3,"Global Economic Outlook: July 2021

Global economic activity in 2022 is expected to surpass pre-COVID-19 levels as economies recover. While a full economic recovery is expected, a return to previous growth levels will take several years and require a broad-based, sustainable expansion. Many risks persist, reflecting not only the health of the COVID-19 pandemic but also the risks related to climate change.
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a severe economic challenge for global growth. Since mid-2020, the economy has contracted in several advanced economies and in most major emerging market and developing economies. The path of pandemic recovery remains highly uncertain. Global gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to increase by 6% in 2021, an uptick from the 5.5% contraction in 2020, and accelerate to 5.9% in 2022, in line with the IMF's April 2021 World Economic Outlook projections, although growth will remain well below projected pre-pandemic levels. This would be the first recovery to meet the Fund's definition of a ""broad-based, sustainable expansion"" as a result of the combination of improved health conditions and stronger global growth.

Global growth is expected to rebound to 6% in 2021 and to 5."

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) found that 51% of UK adults had been affected in the last month. One in five (21%) have considered ending their own lives, up from 14% at the height of the first wave.
The ONS study, which quizzed more than 25,000 adults last month, also found people living in more deprived areas were twice as likely to take their lives compared with people in more affluent communities.
But it is in people's ""self-sufficiency"" in managing their lives during the pandemic that this inequality is being demonstrated, with those in the UK's most deprived areas most likely to have experienced the biggest problems in areas including relationship breakdowns, poor mental health, and financial problems.

The American public had grown accustomed to the sight of American soldiers invading Afghanistan and the news of the continuing campaign against al-Qaeda. The only time the public heard from its own government was when reports were transmitted from the White House or the Pentagon. For the next decade the United States continued to take a military approach to combatting terrorism. But the American public also became increasingly hostile to the US military's constant presence around the world. Public concern for the troops, and those who died and were injured, began to fade from the news as the years went by.
As the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan waned in public attention as did the public's willingness to spend money on defense. Even as the American military began to withdraw from Iraq at the end of 2011 the American public did not make a show of military support like it did during the 2000s.

 Article: The French Open, delayed by a day after players threatened to boycott the opening ceremony on Thursday, is set to resume Saturday with the third round delayed by three hours because of continuing rain. Organizers said that a backlog of 144 holes had been completed on what remained of the Friday schedule. A handful of other events were cancelled or postponed as a result of the inclement weather, but the French tennis federation insisted the clay court tournament would proceed. The opening ceremony, which the players initially boycotted as a protest against organizers over their ""unacceptable"" conditions in the Covid-19 era, went ahead as scheduled, with both organizers and players wearing face masks. The tournament's final rounds are expected to resume Saturday.

 A Brief Analysis of the Global Economy, COVID-19 & Climate Change 2020-2030 The Global Economy: Global economic performance was already showing some signs of slowing before the onset of COVID-19 which, combined with the slowdown since the 2008 financial crisis, has pushed the global economy into recession and triggered considerable volatility in global financial markets over recent months. With the exception of manufacturing, economic prospects for 2020 had been clouding over well before the global pandemic crisis with a combination of geopolitical risks, slowing growth and a slowdown in the global economy. At the same time, the world was also becoming more divided in terms of its social and economic developments. While inequality had previously been growing, it now appears that it has reached a"

It forced governments to impose lockdowns and take many more measures to save people and also to strengthen surveillance measures. It has also created new digital ways of working while maintaining or improving human contact. Although the virus has no cure and a vaccine will not be available in the near future, it is vital to strengthen contact tracing and other preventive measures if we want to come out of these unprecedented times. The world economy is expected to grow by 7.5 percent this year as the economy was already improving in 2020 before the pandemic hit. But, there is still great concern and the recovery is likely to take some time.```

Then it provides data on the dynamics of this trading with a particular focus on the most popular cryptocurrency pairs in the crypto market (Bitcoin/US dollar, and Bitcoin/Euro). Moreover, the article takes into account the prospects for this year and the next, assessing both qualitative and quantitative factors (for example, the rate of interest on the cryptocurrency markets worldwide). This forecast is also supplemented by the prospects for the cryptocurrency market according to blockchain technologies, such as the blockchain architecture of the largest cryptocurrency (bitcoin), its main technical features, its possible limitations, its prospects for integration into modern banking and finance, and its prospects for cryptocurrency mining. Finally, the article also provides a conclusion, which will allow the reader to understand the current level of interest in the cryptocurrency market and its prospects for the coming years.```

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is also exacerbating gender inequalities, with women and girls facing greater risks.

Women and girls also face an increased risk of violence and discrimination.

The global economic health is a global state of balance of public expenditures that affect the wellbeing of citizens, relative to GDP.

I'll give you 2 points if you can explain the two different meanings of ```structure''' in the first half of the summary.
Thanks, Brian.

As a hint, the use of  and  is not part of the structure of the article.

The structure is as follows:
The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions,...

""Global economy"" is the noun, ""pandemic"", ""geopolitical tensions"" and ""climate change"" are the adjectives, and ""response"" (which is also in the body of the article) is both the verb and the noun.

Thanks Brian!

You're welcome :)

Which version appears most effective?

There is no general rule, since each presentation should work for the specific article that is being analyzed. However, given that the most obvious differences in summary lengths are the URLs and lists, I thought to myself that if you are not going to add your own summary you may as well go to the most effective version...

Questions

The primary purpose of the course is to learn how to analyze summaries, which would be a useful skill for a writer or editor. But it is not just summaries. There are many aspects of the job of writing that are important for both writers and editors to understand - or at least to recognize when we find ourselves in a difficult situation.

How does one decide which summary to use? How do you know if a summary is biased or inaccurate? Should quotes be attributed? How do you find examples to back up your point? How do you use dictionaries or encyclopedias to find information? How do you write a balanced, informative article? Is there such a thing as an objective summary?

And all of this assumes the reader is an informed one who could be"

77962,0,"Despite these challenges, however, the economy is expected to post modest growth in 2020, aided in part by monetary policy easing and fiscal stimulus.```

 The text in the article with URLs and the list/bibliography of sources is:  ```A new Nockolds research and policy paper, Understanding Wales: Economic Change 2014 – 2040, examines potential trends and policy implications affecting Wales's economic performance in the years ahead. The paper also highlights the potential to grow the nation's digital economy, which has become increasingly prominent in recent years as the UK has seen an increase in digital businesses.```

A similar approach would lead to the following :

 ```Despite the challenges of COVID-19 and other global events, the UK is expected to post modest economic growth in 2020 - aided in part by monetary policy easing and fiscal stimulus. At the same time, some major economic shifts are underway which will have lasting effects through to the later part of the century - these include the rising popularity of robotics and the increased emphasis on automation in various industries. Policymakers, therefore, have an opportunity to create a more innovative economy, with the resulting economic growth, higher productivity and improved public satisfaction.'`

This is according to a new study that concludes keeping global oil production between 2030 and 2065 at its current level would be impossible due to the devastating consequences to the climate, while limiting emissions to 45-56% of current levels in that period would limit the warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and 2C above pre-industrial levels would be possible. The world would only meet half of its climate targets by 2030, while even with ambitious policies, it would only limit warming to 1.78C – 2.05C. In other words, we are running out of time to address climate change. The study looked at the current level of fossil fuel production as a baseline by examining the potential supply of fossil fuels, which would be in play depending on the path the world takes towards lower-carbon electricity generation. The study concluded that unless the world’s economic trajectory changes over the next 15 years and it shifts towards a cleaner energy system, global emissions would rise to 612GtE in 2030, and then almost double to 1093GtE in 2065, a level"

However, economic growth in emerging and developing economies is much stronger than expected. And while the impact of the pandemic in some advanced countries has been somewhat worse than initially feared, growth will recover and the economic impact will be minimal. It is in these fast-growing emerging and developing economies where the long-term growth opportunities are found. Our portfolio managers consider these countries to be the 'winners' of what we expect to be a less favorable global environment.

 A simple alternative is to use a summary paragraph.  This allows the information in a summary to be distilled into a small paragraph of 2-4 lines with only the most significant facts.

The summary paragraph is useful when there are not many significant details that can be elaborated on in the context of the remainder of the article.  Also a longer summary paragraph can cause the reader to have to sift through the rest of the article to extract the information of interest."
86279,1,"This article argues that the global economy needs to be fundamentally reformed to ensure sustained growth because rising inequality and slower growth has reduced the capacity of society to bear further large economic shocks. Government fiscal policy and financial regulation and supervision are insufficient to prevent excessive inequality or to mitigate economic downturns. Fiscal stimulus needs to take a much wider view and needs to focus on the long-term goal of economic stability. The financial regulatory system needs to protect individuals and their assets from future recessions by imposing more onerous capital requirements; re-establishing bank regulations; restricting speculative trading; and encouraging economic diversification. To achieve that we need effective institutions to coordinate fiscal actions. Governments, on their own, have limited means to reform the global economy. Given this failure, governments and international bodies are adopting reforms aimed at supporting economic growth in the long run. Global institutions should have more permanent seats on World Bank and IMF boards to give them stronger legitimacy and a firmer voice; their oversight of monetary policy should be strengthened; and they are considering new tools to ensure long-term fiscal stability. ```

EOL: Overview

EOL, formerly the Electronic Office, is the clearinghouse that oversees the publication of all market-sensitive research papers, including research from EconLit, a collaborative project between the Econometrics Department and the Computational Journalism Group at the University of Michigan. EOL makes available both historical and peer-reviewed articles and book reviews from the EconMetrics EconLit Repository.

EOL has replaced several Web sites, including EconEmpower, which became the World Bank's EconPapers Web site, with EconLit which the Econometrics Department will continue to maintain. The Econometrics Department Web site will also serve as a resource for researchers considering applying for tenure, posting reviews of their tenure applications. Researchers who do not have tenure will also be offered the opportunity to post their articles and book reviews.
The Econometrics Department also made available a number of old World Bank and International Monetary Fund publications to which, in most cases, the World Bank has no current copyright: e.g. Banknotes Manual, Financial Sector Services Manual, and Economic Management"

What is so important about my example that this approach is essential? How does the example help explain the challenge with simple words and visuals?

Here is the answer: If only the challenges or the solutions are described in plain text, the reader must rely mostly on what he already knows. This is usually not enough for readers to become engaged. A more effective approach is to combine the plain text summary with more complex material, which also explains the challenge but is less accessible.

[Editor] Evan,
I have seen it both ways: as a summary as well as the full text. The full text is usually longer and more detailed, and it is normally written in plain text.
As for the error you are finding, perhaps there were not enough words when it was first published, so was shortened. Not every piece has an introduction, so the writer may have simply decided to omit it.

We can use this approach to create summaries automatically by choosing a section from the article text, which can be obtained from any text-based input, eg news feed articles, and selecting the most relevant articles on any subject, with a single pass over the text.

By taking advantage of summarization and machine learning algorithms that process and summarize article documents we can automate the generation of summaries and automatically update the summaries from real-time data sources such as, web page pages, RSS feeds, and Wikipedia

5312,3,"The Global Economy Faces an Unprecedented Challenge--The COVID-19 Pandemic''
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a heavy toll on the world's economy and it appears to be accelerating despite the widespread introduction of lockdowns and other measures intended to contain the virus. Some economic indicators, including the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) which measures the health of the economy, are still in the contraction phase. The pandemic seems to be on course to cause a major economic recession and the possibility of a depression looms. This will worsen the social and political divide between the haves and have-nots. Climate change is another major challenge which the world is unable to cope with. Scientists warn that the Earth is nearing the point of no return regarding temperature rises.
In spite of the unprecedented problems facing the world today, the IMF and the World Bank have already announced plans to provide more than $12 billion in emergency financing.
Implications: Global leaders and institutions must take bold steps to provide adequate economic stimulus and avoid the pitfalls of populism and nationalism which are likely to follow in the wake of an economic crisis.

It is not enough to merely summarize the facts in a 200 word statement as a number of readers have commented, because people know the facts. Readers will look at the complete information because it will help answer the big one or two questions.  The facts are that the economy is shrinking and the impact of the virus on the economy is severe; at least this much is fairly obvious. How severe is uncertain? It also assumes that people can get the 200 words in the summary to fit into a 200 word space (although the more space, the more accurate the information, and it will be easier to write the summary), and that they know how to write a logical summary (although they may not be able to).

29108,4,"The global economy is currently dealing with a number of issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and rising climate change concerns. Global economic growth in the last quarter of 2020 had slowed considerably compared to 2019, with the IMF noting that the pandemic likely contributed to the slowest growth rate in a decade for the advanced economies. The World Bank expects a global economic growth rate of 5.5% over 2021 and 2022 and 3.3% for the euro area in each of these years. ```

 Summary text: `The global economy has been hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis, the global recession, geopolitical threats and changing climatic conditions. Global economic growth is set to contract by 3% in 2020, the worst recession since the Great Depression in 1929/1930, according to the IMF. Recovery is expected to start in 2021,"

Despite rising inflationary pressures in developed nations like the United States, European Central Bank officials see moderate upward economic growth, albeit with some downside risks. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is forecasting that global GDP will expand by 5.8% in 2020 based on the assumption that the COVID-19 pandemic is resolved by then and economic shockwaves are not severe enough to reverse this rebound. However, even without the pandemic, global GDP would have contracted in 2019. Governments are pursuing measures such as spending and infrastructure investments that would lift GDP. However, they are facing increasing demands for more debt and pension reforms from already hard-pressed citizens.

As you can see there is a difference in how the two articles and their summaries are worded. The summary in plain text for Article 1 has just about the same amount of lines and information as the summary for Article 2. For what appears to me to be a major difference of style and substance in the summaries used. It seems very strange, especially given what is in the article to which the summaries are appended. To me the summaries in plain text are very much more like those that you would find in an essay or a summary of an article that is written by an outside scholar or consultant for a particular news network. The summaries used in a news story are like those used in news broadcasts on the radio or on television. They should have a short concise summary and then a longer (in general) but more informative paragraph that adds context, as well as more details from the article in more detail. In my opinion the summaries from the article"

In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak and recent geopolitical tensions have put into question the United States' role in the world, especially its leadership role. While these external shocks are testing the international community, we should never allow the challenges we face to overwhelm our ability to work together to find common-sense solutions in the public good. At the G-20 summit, world leaders committed to work together, and to support developing countries most impacted by this crisis.

This is exactly what I meant. A summary would never be better than the original story.

Well, a plain text summary is exactly what's going to happen on BBC News. You can go on their website and read everything. I'm in the UK; what they say happens on TV (and radio) is what happens on their website.

I know it's always good to see the original story when browsing news, but I'm pretty sure this won't happen.
I'm in UK as well, and BBC don't do a lot of summary of TV, but you can always listen to BBC Radio 4, which is pretty different to TV. They also don't use many pictures at all for news, not even on radio 4.

I’m not sure what the question is, though it sounds confusing on its face. Do you think the BBC should write summaries of news? Well, that’s up to them.
My point is that this isn’t an “article�"

Instead of pocketing the $125,000 that Cornell, of Fresno, California, discovered when he opened the package, the down-on-his luck homeless man did the right thing - and returned all of it.

The global economy is predicted to grow by 3% in 2021, despite the pandemic disrupting supply chains, and the global oil price falling to half its 2020 levels over the first quarter of the year, before rebounding to its 2019 levels in the current fourth quarter. Global inflation has risen to a seven month high, which is caused by the impact of rising commodity prices on supply chains and inflation from the reopening of the global economy. Global unemployment will likely rise to 8% in 2021, and the global economic impact of the pandemic is still uncertain. The global economy has recovered faster than expected, with many developed nations returning to pre-pandemic GDP levels by the end of the second quarter of this year, while many less developed economies are seeing only very slow growth. The US economy is expected to achieve its pre-pandemic level by the third quarter of this year, with growth in the euro area remaining depressed below 2.5% and Japan's expansion well behind 2% for 2021.

This is a classic ""false summary"" example where the facts presented in the article are not the actual facts that have been reported but presented this is a more dramatic way to make a point.

 Example - an ad for a product that is claimed to cure AIDS.

  The ad consists of multiple sentences, each of which are numbered in the order in which they appear, along with the product name and address for more information.

Example 1

''It's a small thing...but a good idea - the ""T"" for ""test"" on this red, white, and blue AIDS ribbon has been replaced by the letter ""T"" for ""test"" to emphasize the importance of getting tested for HIV. Now, there's nothing so small or so ""dissing"" to stop an HIV-positive person from going forward with a full life.''

A link to the detailed item, and a link to the summary should be provided where both are available.

 Background or implications to the content
The summary is often a short section of text that summarizes a longer document. It is normally the first thing that users see when they read a document, so must be clear and informative. This contrasts with other elements in a document, such as paragraphs of plain text or graphical images which users can view on other pages.

The summary should also be consistent with other material in a document. This may be difficult, however, if other material is added after the summary. For example, if the summary contains a new and unexpected claim about health benefits of a treatment, the claims of the other documents in the pack may need to be adjusted.

It is also important that the summary, as set out in the guide, does not contain information that users can get in more detail in the other documents."

52337,2,"The pandemic-driven collapse in economic growth, coupled with geopolitical tensions and climate change, has led to a weakening of the global economy. While the outlook is still uncertain, we expect the global economic contraction to be the worst since the Great Depression. The recession has exacerbated inequality, with lower-income households facing the greatest challenges making it harder for them to afford daily necessities. The World Bank estimates that the global economy is expected to shrink by 4%. While growth rates are picking up in Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America, they are expected to remain under 5% for the year. The economic downturn presents both opportunities and challenges for governments. It presents opportunities to improve the quality of social safety nets, strengthen health systems, and accelerate the implementation of green and digital-led strategies and policies. It also presents an unprecedented opportunity to address the root causes of weak and fragile economies, while fostering sustainability through low-carbon transitions. However, poor countries still require financial support to protect their people, prevent financial crises, and facilitate structural transformations to build resilience and reduce vulnerability. Governments' debt levels remain unsustainably high, due to elevated global risk aversion, increased risk mitigation requirements in sovereign debt markets, and heightened financing costs. To prevent a financial crisis and safeguard the world economy from"

By Daniel Tannebaum. Economic indicators suggest strong U.S. growth is ahead, but the recovery across the rest of the world is expected to lag. Many nations in Europe and Asia are likely to be hit harder by the resurgence of Covid-19. Global GDP is forecast to expand by 5.2% this year, a sharp slowdown from last year’s 6.0%. This forecast is just over a percentage point less than our forecast last month. The forecast revision is largely due to an increase in the projected contraction in Latin America, where GDP is expected to be down 8.4% this year, 2.4 percentage points higher than last month’s forecast. There are clear signs that the economic recovery in Europe and Japan has significantly slowed in recent months due to the resurgence of Covid-19. The United States has been more resilient thus far, although significant challenges await if new infections surge again. The U.S. GDP is expected to expand by 6.3% in 2021, which is the highest forecast in years. The pandemic has led to an acceleration in productivity and technology, which will help to"

They have also been told to immediately pull the products from sale and ask their Halal food supplier to stop use of the pork-meat ingredient until they are fully investigated and can prove they have found no further evidence of contamination in the meat. This action by Westminster Council will hopefully go a long way to removing the scaremongering and hysteria that has been so rampant within the UK, and will help clear up the confusion for the general public. This is a small case of contamination that has potentially been blown out of all proportion, in part because of the hysteria-inducing news that has been written so far by the press. The bottom line is that while pork DNA is not a health threat and does not mean that the sausages are unsuitable for Muslims or any others for that matter, we should all learn to better distinguish between what is pure and what is not.```

Background:  ```Globalization, technology, international trade, and other factors that have improved social conditions for the majority of the world's population have also increased competition and inequalities, including the growing divide between rich and poor countries.

The income share of the top 1% has increased by nearly a third (28%) since 2000, while the share of the bottom half of the population has seen a rise of only 5%.

The first item is about to occur and it is followed by item 2.
The sentence in the example is not a single sentence sentence, so it would be in error to use list elements.

The second item occurs and it too contains a list  but it is just a list of items about item 1. I think that is a bad argument.

If you want to do that you have to rewrite the article, since the examples can not be extracted. It makes the article more difficult. But since that is true of many articles you won't do that and in that case don't use lists.

I don't use lists in most of my work because you need to rewrite the whole sentence to add lists, which is annoying."

The number of deaths linked to Covid-19 increased by 326 in one day to reach 49,770, according to latest government figures. The daily increase of 13% was the highest daily increase since mass testing of asymptomatic people was introduced, the government said.
The number of people being treated in hospital for coronavirus rose to 5,938, up from 5,546 on Thursday.
It will be Monday before the number of deaths has stabilised as the seven-day average is now rising again, as it did during the first wave of the disease.
However, the increase was not as marked as that seen on Thursday. Of particular concern will be the rise within the over-80s age group, which jumped to 1,111, up from 1,029 a day earlier.

In times of acute crisis, fiscal policy should remain in the realm of emergency response to mitigate the pain associated with a slowdown in the economy. It is important, however, that fiscal interventions are temporary. They must not become the new normal and, in fact, must be phased out as quickly as possible afterwards so that countries do not lose fiscal discipline. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need to reduce barriers to trade, open up financial markets, and modernise the governance of monetary policymaking. Countries must also work to align fiscal policy with the objectives of sustainable development. The current crisis poses significant and immediate challenges to poverty reduction. However, governments must not lose sight of the long-term goal of achieving an inclusive, sustainable, and resilient recovery. This means taking swift action to strengthen public"

11411,4,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the fragility of global supply chains and highlighted the importance of having local suppliers in critical industries. The economic collapse has seen many manufacturers rethink their globalised business models and take steps to break out of what has been described as a `value chainshell’.
One of the challenges with this approach, in our view at least, is that it takes a step back to a time where a global supply chain was not an economic necessity. Manufacturing is an inherently dynamic and competitive business which provides many key benefits to the economy. It is also an industry where automation has been embraced by a number of large and small manufacturers for years: reducing labour costs and increasing productivity.
As an industry which has benefited from technology, the automotive and automotive-alternative parts industry is more likely to embrace supply chain changes sooner rather than later. For example, the industry has been at the forefront of adopting manufacturing automation, with adoption of robotics technologies for more than 30 years. The most obvious example is the automotive robots market which continues to grow in Europe and North America, driven by the need to improve production efficiency, boost output and reduce costs. Automation is not a silver bullet however and it is not possible to completely eliminate labour from production;"

28689,3,"The global economy is in recession. However, the worst seems to be behind us, especially when compared to the devastation suffered in the first quarter of 2020 when widespread lockdown measures were in effect. We think it is safe to say that the worst is definitively over, as the current quarter is estimated to show at least 1% year on year growth, in particular if COVID-19 vaccinations roll out quickly and effectively. If you compare this quarter with the first quarter of 2020, where GDP fell 4.8%, we are looking at the equivalent of $4.6 trillion more being spent in the second quarter than last year. However, there is little question that the second quarter will still be below the 2019 level, when GDP reached 3.3 trillion and we still don't have a vaccine to prevent further waves of the pandemic. This puts us in a fragile state. A wave of infections in 2021 could easily put us back in recession. The world has also started to reopen – albeit slowly. This means most businesses are being opened up again. However, it is far from clear if this is in an orderly, controlled fashion.

51195,2,"Many people think they are healthy when they are having more calories than they are burning. However, many people who mistakenly think they are healthy are actually having massive amounts of calories in a single sitting. Eating excess calories is the main culprit for fat gain, so avoiding excess calories is important. But how do we do this? Excess calories come in the form of snacks, sweets, drinks and food. We will look at how to prevent this excess from happening. The first step is to decide how many calories to allot for different body parts and activities. There are so many sources for this and many of them are great. They include the National Weight Control Registry, the USDA Food Calculator, the Body Mass Index table, and the USDA's Dietary Guidelines for Americans. These will help us determine how much food each part and activity will use. To find out if you are consuming extra calories, track what and how much you eat. To do this, choose a day to track calories that is based on your regular eating habits. This will be easier if you use some sort of calorie tracking device. The more you track, the more accurately you will be able to tell if you are consuming too many calories. Keeping track is probably more helpful at first. If it requires extreme effort to keep"

Shani Clarke's son used to drink at least four 500 ml cans of Mother, a popular energy drink, a day as well as four to five cups of coffee before he was found slumped behind the wheel of an 11 tonne truck on the side of the road in Perth recently. The young man - Michael Clarke - suffered a massive heart attack which saw him die from caffeine toxicity. Ms Clarke decided to educate others on the dangers of energy drinks through her Facebook page- Caffeine Toxicity Death Awareness.

 Pandemic: In this context the pandemic is further limiting global trade which is considered a global supply chain infrastructure. This means that any disruption within the global trade could harm global economic growth, with global trade dropping by more than 10% in the second quarter of 2020.

 Global Economy: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in severe financial and systemic stress, with global unemployment rising to the highest level since 1948, trade falling, consumer spending declining, and inflation rising rapidly.

All five fires took place within 15 minutes on Thursday night.

Four hours later, there was a blaze at two businesses in North Head.

The show's presenter Matt Allwright and his team secretly checked to see whether the firm had a secure car park by providing three fake customers who handed over cars to Gold Parking. The customers were charged £90 for one week and £150 for two weeks to have their vehicle taken to the company's ""secure car park"", but on each occasion the cars were left out in the open in Crawley, in a communal public car park, outside shops and in a residential side street. Gold Parking claimed it provided a ""world-first premium concierge service"". Matt Allwright and his team discovered not only that the firm had no security but that it had parked cars in a nearby public swimming pool car park, which they described as ""a car park with absolutely no barriers or fencing"". Gold Parking also denied ever using police officers as security and described having been told by police it could not use parking officers because of concerns about ""intimidation"".

Hello to everyone. In a world first, scientists have dated the bones in the oldest known burial chamber in the United Kingdom. Based on a method they have called ""calibrated stable isotope analysis of bone carbon and oxygen,"" their estimate is that the burials occurred between the years 1585 and 1825 -- which would make them as recent as one hundred years ago, and as far back as 1300. The skulls belong to males -- including children between the ages of four and nine. Some of the bones of one of the skulls were found to contain what the scientists called human-type"

24797,1,"Main article : Australia's Terrorism Threat Level : High because some radicalised Australians could carry out attacks

 Summary : Australia's terrorism threat level is on high alert again because a growing number of radicalised Australians are preparing to leave the country to fight with the Islamic State. This comes as Australian authorities are believed to have thwarted a number of imminent plots by terror suspects, who have abandoned the idea of fighting with the militants. The threat level was raised to high earlier this year after intelligence suggested IS was plotting to send 'fighters' to Australia. But the threat level is not expected to be raised to its highest possible status of red any time soon. The latest rise in the threat level follows a series of investigations which saw six people charged with plotting to carry out attacks in the wake of the Paris massacres in November 2015. Four out of five of those charged are from the Muslim-majority western Sydney suburb of Guildford and have been described as part of the 'Guildford five'. One of those charged, Ali Khalif Shire Ali, was found not guilty over a plot to attack a police headquarters following his arrest in 2017. The charges prompted renewed calls for changes to Australia's counter-terrorism laws, which currently place an absolute ban on Australians engaging in terrorism abroad and a range"

24797,3,"There are some very concerning signals from ASIO, our domestic counter terrorism agency,'' Mr Irvine told reporters while in Singapore. Police Minister Bill Byrne indicated the new threat to Australia is ''more imminent and more serious than anything we've seen in the last five to 10 years''. He said recent events involving a suicide bombing in Iraq ''demonstrate the potential for a large threat to our country''. 'We need to ensure we've got the proper resources to respond to any threat in Australia and that's an ongoing priority for the Turnbull Government,' he said. However, Mr Byrne said it was too early to suggest Australia was facing an imminent Al Qaeda threat similar to that of September 11 2001. In fact, Mr Byrne noted Mr Succarieh and Kruezi are accused of trying to obtain a visa to travel to Syria. 'The bottom line is at this point in time we don't have any indication of a threat of any kind. This is really more of an operational issue,' he said. Mr Succarieh's lawyer, Mark Stewart SC, yesterday questioned why they were charged with terrorism offences when they had allegedly committed no crime. But Mr Byrne said their case would have no impact on the government's proposed border protection legislation.

The World Economic Forum, in collaboration with Mastercard, forecasts that a recovery in economic output will be slower and more protracted than previously anticipated. Global growth is projected at 6.0%, compared with 4.2% in 2020. In 2021, growth is expected to accelerate to 5.4%, but this is lower than in previous forecasts. A global recovery could be even weaker than what's being anticipated if a resurgence in the pandemic occurs, if new strains of the virus emerge, or if more governments introduce restrictive policies in response to a resurgence in COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences pose acute challenges for the global economic system and many individual states.

However, some large emerging economies showed strong growth last year and will continue to see solid growth in 2021. The overall performance of the system and that of each country is closely linked to the impact of the pandemic, especially the emergence of new variants. The economic fallout from COVID-19 will not be only a short-term shock to the global economy and individual states. If the pandemic were to linger over a prolonged period, the consequences would be severe. Some G20 economies are already experiencing an extended slump while others have only barely begun to experience its effects. Moreover, recovery is likely to be very uneven, depending on the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the capacity of affected states to mobilize public support, as well as the effectiveness of the policy responses.

This isn't a simple problem. In your example, the summary is already part of the text of the article you are showing. You have to decide what you want to see and how close to the text of the article you want to see it, and build that from scratch.

The crisis that began in 2008, then spread to Europe and then spread to the U.S., had many causes – the main cause was over-leveraging and the credit binge that led to high leverage. Financial speculation turned real business activity into gambling behavior, and financial institutions engaged in market speculation.

Under the action, U.S. authorities have also imposed sanctions on Iran's central bank, saying it is enabling illegal trade with Syria. The sanctions imposed last week on the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center, and the Iranian Development Bank have 'taken down a lot of the key money transmitters' for Iran's central bank, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Director David Cohen told reporters. He said they would not prohibit central banks' access to the international financial system, but he said they would cut off certain accounts of Iran's central bank from the U.S. financial system by prohibiting U.S. banks from opening or maintaining correspondent relationships with them.```

91440,1,"The economic forecasts, although subject to the usual uncertainties associated with forecasting, show a strong continuation of the trend of recent years. The expected level of the GDP will be substantially higher than in the 2008-2009 crisis year (in 2016.8 percent compared to 2008.4 percent) and, despite the current crisis, the growth will have remained above the average of recent years (in 2015.1 percent over the ten years before the crisis).
This will help the GDP to converge toward the long-term trend (5.9 percent from the current 3 percent).
The annual GDP growth will have reached 4.3 percent in 2020 and is expected to continue at the same pace over the years after that, which would bring the GDP in the year 2025 to close to the level seen in 2007 (i.e. 6.0 percent).
Such performance would allow the unemployment rate to fall to 2.8 percent and to eventually fall even lower than 2.8 percent in 2025, to 2.5 percent in 2030 and to about 1.1 percent in 2040.  `

68861,1,"the global economy has become increasingly intertwined with political issues since the global economic crisis of 2008 to 2009.
Since then, the global economy has come under more strain and governments have been pushed to implement policies that address the challenges the economy is facing.  These include fiscal stimulus packages in the form of public investment in areas such as infrastructure.  In addition, a number of governments have introduced large subsidies and programs aimed at maintaining the living standards of their people.  For governments whose domestic economies are struggling, it can be difficult to continue paying a portion of these costs through taxation, and as this economic burden continues to grow, these policies make it harder for emerging markets to continue to fund their programs.  In a world of limited global economic resources, this is a concerning trend that policymakers need to address moving forward.

In this situation, should the summary contain more text giving a detailed explanation?  What would be a good way to do this without disrupting the summary or making the summary too long?  I have not yet written a short summary.

What can I do to help improve the above sample in the following ways?

In the first couple sentences, should I have bolded the two sentences as an emphasis or have you just written that?  You have written bolded twice.

In the 4th paragraph and 4 last lines, should I put (for example) in quotes, or write the word?

Should I just drop those sentences?

What else can I add (or get rid of)?"

83743,3,"Summary A global recession looms amid rising geopolitical tensions and the economic crisis from the viral pandemic.
The International Monetary Fund has cut forecasts for growth in the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany, Canada and Japan.
The virus has already forced the world's second- and third-largest economies, China and India, to take stronger action to support their virus-hit economies.
It also hit growth the most in the Euro area, which contracted nearly 12% while the recession in the United Kingdom was a record 20% in April when much of the country was under some form of lockdown restrictions.
Other significant growth falls include 9.5% in the United States, more than 11% in Australia and almost 11% in Canada.
The IMF now expects the global economy to shrink by 4% this year, which would be the worst annual contraction since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
It's a dramatic fall from January, when the IMF had expected 3.3% global growth.
It would be four times greater than the 2009 recession, but the forecast is the second-best the IMF has ever made since the creation of its benchmark global growth monitor in 1980.

Global economy faces unprecedented strains as pandemic worsens, geopolitical tension and climate change intensify
GDP growth slowed to 2.5 per cent in the April-June period, the slowest since the global financial crisis. A global recession is likely in the July-September period.
Facing these growing challenges, governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms and additional support packages for markets and sustainable growth.
But those responses come with mounting costs. They will need significant long-term funds, which might already be stretched thin. While stimulus measures may boost short-term growth, they may also increase risk taking. They will not be enough for longer term problems—such as slow productivity growth, insufficient infrastructure and low social cohesion.

This is just a tiny example of an issue. The main purpose of a summary text is to give the reader:

1- the key news in the summary text
2- a single clear statement
2- a single clear opinion, based on a single source
2- a single clear statistic that supports a given opinion or statement
3- a single clear statement based on a single news item

The goal is to give each section a single clear and distinct meaning. The general rule of thumb is that the summary should contain:
*  A simple explanation of the argument and/or main conclusion
*  An explanation of how the argument or main conclusion is based on data, statistics or other types of information

He said the driver asked the woman to go to the office if she had a complaint, which she did, and another National Express member of staff came to the bus and asked the man to leave.

I would like to write a summary of the article, using just this part. The problem is that the summaries often need links to the main text because of its length, and most of the summaries I find include URLs that appear before the summary text even begins. I can't figure out how to make this work while still keeping an entire website URL out of the text. It also seems like the plain text doesn't always have URLs that I could use for the headers, and this makes it even harder. Is there any way I can make this work?

Please note that on the home page, this is the header:

This is not a header/footer issue – this is a CSS issue. The CSS is only supposed to affect the header and footer, not the article text.

You're right, that header text is in a different div from the original article text, and so the rules don't apply."

 Article: By. Mail Online Reporter. In a case that has drawn widespread attention and concerns, a 30-year-old mother was arrested Thursday for allegedly killing her two-year-old daughter. The arrest of Jessica Smith came two days after two-year-old Isabella Smith was found dead and her 13-year-old daughter Alana Smith seriously injured in a Clatsop County hotel room. Smith was arrested off a remote logging road in northern Oregon with the help of state police, the US Coast Guard and the Clatsop County Sheriff’s Office. “We knew something important was going to happen and we were going to find Jessica,” Portland police Lt. Mike Schermerhorn told KATU. “What we didn’t know is where she was."

Hi Nanci,

You're welcome!

This is actually something that I have been working on for my Master thesis. I am trying to determine the effectiveness of the plain text summary (or PSTR) in news aggregation and news search. If you click on the question mark in the PSTR section to the right of the article summary, it will show you exactly what goes into the plain text summary: the top three sentences are the original, the bottom three are the summary and an unordered list of links.

The bottom is a searchable plain text summary, which you can run with HIG's search engine on the web site at : )"
17562,1,"The BBC needs to be reformed on two fronts, one reform being to reform its governance structures, and another reform being to reform the nature of the corporation, as it looks to move away from the 'old style' state broadcaster model. ```   (Summary is taken from  BBC article, without URL or ""list"")

 Summary: BBC executives argued that new technology, global competition, consumer demand for choice and quality, increased regulation and increasing competition from the Internet, meant that it needed reform. (see below for more details)  In response: The Government published a White Paper in June 2000 to create new governance structures for the BBC.  The White Paper set out reforms to the roles of the Corporation’s Chairman and President, and made it easier to make appointments and remove directors when necessary.  The White Paper proposed the following:

 1. The role of President, which existed in the past under the existing BBC Boards, would be “reconsolidated.”  The President would be a civil servant, appointed by the Secretary of State, who would be expected to work with the BBC’s elected members to ensure the BBC fulfilled its public service mission.

 2. The BBC’s role as a regulator would be central"

To understand better how the Web Hypertext Preprocessor (WHPs) works, it helps to first understand exactly how a Web page really is.

A Web page is a set of HTML codes, structured in a logical order known as an XML document.

Each HTML code or element comprises a set of links to other HTML codes or elements.
When the markup, or code, is displayed by a web browser, those links are

displayed using HTMLs that look like links. This gives the illusion that the entire
web page was loaded from a link (or hyperlink) at one point in time.

Which format should be used?
The detailed summary is an abstract from the original text (in plain text), whereas the abstract is a one sentence summary in a standard format such as APA 6th edition.
The abstract is used in a text citation; the summary in an online ""web-site search"".

What kind of a citation is required?
As the detailed summary is an abstract, it is not part of an article; hence there is no citation. If it is quoted in a paper, the authors are referred to by their last names, as in (Smith et al.) Smith and (Chang et al.).

How do we extract the key arguments in these simple summaries, which use a list to represent the topic. We have to somehow get at one key element of the summary.  For example, how might we identify the key ""causes of the current downturn"" in a quick but useful summary.  We can't use ```political tensions and climate change``` because they are both mentioned explicitly in the summary's ""causes of the current downturn"" and both refer to political tensions.

I've had some success with a couple of methods, but nothing that works well enough by itself. I'm asking to see if anyone has an idea that might be worth looking into a bit more.

The global economy is experiencing several shocks – in addition to the impact of Covid-19, the global economy is also seeing a slowdown in the pace of growth, a drop in oil prices (following the Russia-Saudi Arabia price war), renewed geopolitical tensions (e.g. the US/Iran nuclear negotiations) and climate change (exacerbating supply chain disruptions as well as other economic impacts):
- the ongoing oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia
- the US election (referring to the tariffs policy of US President Trump) and Brexit
- the renewed tensions between Russia and the Ukraine.
All of these factors are exacerbating the slowdown in growth and are affecting the recovery period after the coronavirus crisis.
However, there is still time to improve the recovery,"

This problem applies to any structured document. The text of an article must contain a main title paragraph which introduces the article and an accompanying summary which is a summary of the text of the article. The summary must be a well-structured outline with the following main parts:
 Title (3–6 words)
 A one-paragraph introduction to the summary that informs the reader of what the article is about.
 Summary text (12–15 words)
 Introduction to the main body of the text, typically with a list of words the author thinks will be useful to summarize the main points of the article.

The following figure shows an example of an article with summary paragraphs and an article with an improper summary.

One possible approach to avoid this problem is to separate the title and summary into different paragraphs. Although not necessarily wrong, this is not the recommended approach as the titles and summaries need to be consistent with each other. Instead, authors may wish to include the complete articles title in the title text, and use the one-"

Article: By. Sam Creighton. As temperatures have warmed over the past decade, the United States has borne the brunt of a worsening mosquito problem. Now, new research suggests that as temperatures continue to rise, mosquitoes will likely be able to spread more easily, potentially causing even worse health problems and even more misery for people living in hot places. Commenting on the findings, one of the study's authors, Dr. Benjamin Read, from George Mason University's Center for Climate Impact & Sustainability, said: ''There's lots of evidence of mosquitoes becoming more resilient to warmer temperatures, as well as increasing their ability to survive and reproduce even further.'' The researchers looked at how the spread of the mosquito-borne diseases Zika, chikungunya and dengue -- which are spread by a range of mosquitoes -- has changed as temperature rises. Their findings showed that the ability of dengue and chikung"

Article: By.. Robert W. Baird. As the winter thaws in the United States, experts are warning that the return of spring will bring an influx of rats that could wreak havoc on the population of the city. Cars in Chicago have had to deal with a rise in rodent sightings since the warmer weather hit, and now officials fear that cars are going to come face to face with a boom in their population once the snow begins to melt. One Chicago resident, Kelly, was particularly affected by a car accident this week. He was driving to work as normal when he found himself surrounded by what he called 'a bunch of rats'. Despite being an experienced driver, Kelly was forced to swerve out of the way of the animals, driving into a pole before heading to a local hospital. Commenting on the issue, he said:'When I slammed on my brakes, they just ran into the road"

What will be the effect on the reader?
If you are a teacher, a professor, a librarian, you will think: it will probably get them interested in learning more about history, and will motivate them to read more, and to think about things in a historical perspective.

If you are a parent or a teacher, you will probably think: I want my children to know more about the past, and about their country, so they are better equipped to build a healthy future.

If you are just a reader, you will probably feel: Why did I not pay more attention to history classes in school? Now, I have time to learn more :-)

First, that what appears to be ``the'' sentence does not reflect the true sentence of the article.

It is expected to slow to 2% this year, and grow about 2.3% on average over the next five years. In Europe, growth has slowed considerably, to an average of about 1.3% a year over the past five years--well below its pre-crisis growth rate of about 3.5%. Japan's economy has also grown since the crisis--by just over 0.5% a year since 2009--far from its earlier growth rate of about 4%. Other economically important markets such as emerging markets have grown very slowly since the crisis. A major global concern is that inflation may remain subdued as world economy grows at a moderate rate, but as inflation expectations begin to rise. There is also growing concern about the impact of geopolitical risks in some regions. This report examines the challenges facing the world economy and the global financial markets.```

We were supposed to give the article summary as an answer to the example question. However, in the article, it states that COVID-19, and geopolitical tensions have ''accelerated the'' problems in the global economy. How is geopolitical tensions and COVID-19 accelerating the global economy problems?

What would the correct and the incorrect answer be for this question? Thank you!

It can only be accelerating the problem. The cause isn't part of the problem the way you are thinking it.

This example demonstrates the use of a summary as a starting point.
When you are writing an introduction, remember that an article and summary are examples.  They may not be ideal because
it would take your reader time to find the summary. There are, however, some things to keep in mind:

Be sure that you address the key elements that a reader should take away from your text. This summary does
just that.
There is very little new information that you provide in a summary that is not adequately covered by the first paragraph.
If you have a section after the first paragraph that is not applicable to the summary (e.g., a list of topics) then replace the section by using ""See also"" in the summary. This can be especially important in"

This is in addition to the fact that when the topic is about COVID-19, in fact we usually have at least 10,000 results.

When I google for something I'm looking for, I usually get an estimate of how many results have been linked to that subject recently. As soon as I can't find an estimate in that list, I know it's not something I'm looking for, so there's no reason to look for the actual article.

When it's a less popular (or even a popular topic) Google often shows all the results as a single list, which is too often an endless page of ""articles"" with very little information to offer beyond some summary of the first paragraph or two of the actual ""article"".

I don't think this is an ""artificial lack of interest in popular topics"". I don't think you can say popular articles are not as important to Google as less popular articles.

Governments and central bank monetary policies are attempting to combat these issues through stimulus packages and support, but these are temporary measures. Additionally, current economic models are unable to solve these issues permanently since they are based on growth as the ultimate goal. Therefore, there is a need for new economic models which consider the various issues mentioned above and which are more realistic and sustainable: economic models which look primarily at the quality of life of economic participants as opposed to their total net worth (``growth''), models which create incentives to improve the quality of life of participants, and models which consider climate change as an economic risk instead of as a peripheral issue.

 Summary :  The global economy has been struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change.  Governments in various countries are responding to these challenges with a number of important policy interventions.  In addition, there has been speculation about the economic performance of some countries in recent years.  The pandemic and geopolitical issues have made it harder for low-income families to afford basic necessities.  Fiscal stimulus and monetary policy easing have made it easier for governments to fund fiscal support packages, which has helped the global economy stabilise and recover quickly to near its pre-pandemic level.  At the same time, some countries had achieved better economic development since 2016.  The pandemic, along with increased tensions in Europe, could weaken its financial standing. Economic reforms"

Summary: Newcastle's manager wants 'competitive' wage demands in meeting with owner Alan Pardew could quit the club next week unless the owner agrees to meet his salary demands. The manager is keen to leave St James' Park because the club is currently unable to pay him the salaries of top managers such as Pep Guardiola and Unai Emery, who earn around £15.9m a year at Manchester City and Arsenal respectively. Pardew is seeking a hike in his salary to around £6m plus bonuses after his team secured a Championship play-off place, which would give him a basic base salary of about £3m-£3.5m plus bonuses of around £1m. Ashley, however, is unlikely to meet the manager's wage demands in the wake of Pardew's public criticism of the club's transfer policy. Ashley ducked the post-game press conference"

But governments around the world are prepared. The key will be how much, whether, and how they cooperate to implement their plans. On the upside, policy coordination appears effective and there is less concern that the policy response will lead to unintended consequences. On the downside, policymakers have failed to coordinate in ways that will maximize the impact of their work. There is also some risk that policy moves will come at the expense of growth and employment. However, policymakers worldwide have a good base from which to work. They have a variety of measures they can use to mitigate growth effects. They should focus on improving the recovery, especially by creating jobs and restoring incomes.

Tottenham are in talks with Split over the potential transfer of talented Hajduk Split midfielder Andrija Balic as White Hart Lane look to bolster their ranks. Spurs have made contact with the Croatian club as sporting director Franco Baldini looks to continue his transfer work.

Spurs have already been in negotiations with Hajduk for Croatian teen Mario Pasalic, 19, and the shaggy-haired 16-year-old, who often plays in a defensive role, has caught their attention.

The club have been monitoring Croatian forward Edin Dzeko, 23, but it is unclear whether he is on their list of potential strikers, although they are considering other options.

Tottenham are also looking to add depth to their midfield, meaning talks have been held with Hajduk over ex-Fulham star Strahinja Pavlovic, who has also had interest from Newcastle.

However, Hajduk have asked for close to £4.5million for the teenage star and while Tottenham are willing to try and strike a deal, it is expected that they will not match the asking price.

79570,3,"The Government of the United Kingdom is offering a redundancy package to up to 1,750 employees of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, Harwell, Oxford, following an announcement of major change in the UK’s nuclear deterrent programme.  Employees affected by this proposal have rejected the proposal and have the option of transferring to alternative civilian roles in the programme or retiring early. The new role for the 2,000-strong workforce at the UK’s nuclear weapons centre, Harwell, will focus on maintaining the Trident nuclear-armed submarines, and the nuclear warheads that are loaded onto those submarines. The UK currently has four nuclear-armed submarines, and an extension of their life cycle is due in the early 2020s. It is proposed that nuclear warheads are reloaded into the submarines at Harwell and then transported to their submarines in Faslane, on the Scottish coast. The UK will maintain four of its existing Trident submarines until the end of the post-life extension programme, which would otherwise see the nuclear warheads removed from the submarines in the early 2030s. An earlier proposal to introduce a new UK-designed replacement for Trident and land-based ballistic missiles, which was included in the Government’s Defence White Paper in 2015, is not expected to proceed.

What: A class-action law suit claiming that US banks allowed unauthorised use of customers' information after 2009, despite a 2011 settlement agreement.
Where: Los Angeles, California.
When: The banks in question are Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Citibank and Wells Fargo.
Why: The lawsuit is because of allegations that these same banks have given customers the wrong information about their unauthorised use of accounts -- with customers told there were no fraudulent activity on their accounts at hand, while bank records show another story.
When employees are suspected of theft, the banks automatically flag them, and then the bank does not notify the customer of the suspected fraud. Bank executives have denied that this practice was in place. Even if it was, it would most likely be in violation of the settlement agreement.
When customers complain to the bank, they are told there was no such fraud on the account, but bank records show something different.
When this information is given to the consumer, they call up bank executives and demand their money back. But because the bank did not flag the account as being fraudulent, this is nearly impossible.```
