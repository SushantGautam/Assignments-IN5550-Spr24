Facebook channelled profits through a series of tax havens in order to pay just  £2.9m of corporation tax on more than £800m of overseas profits in 2011, it has been reported. Like Google and Apple the social networking site is said to have used its headquarters in Ireland to avoid tax liabilities in the UK before directing earnings to a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands. British companies that buy advertising on Facebook must do so via Facebook Ireland Ltd which entitles the company to sidestep HM Revenue and Customs and authorities in other higher-tax jurisdictions, reported the Sunday Times today. Under the spotlight: Mark Zuckerberg's (pictured) Facebook last year funnelled earnings into the Cayman Islands via Ireland in order to pay only a fraction in tax on more than £800million of overseas profits . As a result less than £240,000 was paid to the UK taxman. The Dublin office, with a staff of 400 people showed a gross profit of £840million in 2011. Despite this, Facebook Ireland posted a loss of £15million for the year after hundreds of millions were routed to a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands and to its parent company in the U.S. Labour MP John Mann recently spoke out about the company's actions, calling them 'disingenuous and immoral'. 'They benefit enormously from the country's internet infrastructure but do nothing to fund it. It's like driving a car with no tax. We would stand for it on our roads so why stand for it on the net?,' he said. Accounts for Facebook Ireland revealed that last year £440m was moved into an Irish sister company before being diverted to a subsidiary company in the Cayman Islands. A spokesman for Facebook defended its accountancy and said it complied with all relevant regulations and was acting within the legal bounds of taxation. 'Facebook complies with all relevant corporate regulations including those related to filing company reports and taxation,' he said. 'We have our international headquarters in Ireland that employs over four hundred people and a series of smaller local offices providing support services all over Europe. Dublin was selected as the best location to hire staff with the right skills to run a multi-lingual hi-tech operation serving the whole of Europe.' Facebook reported £620million in worldwide profit last year, 44 per cent of this came from outside the U.S. The news comes in the wake of similar behaviour from other multinational . companies like Starbucks and Google who use loopholes to avoid taxes.

Anger: Web giant Google avoided paying $2billion in tax last year by moving around 80 per cent of its overseas profits to a company in the tax haven of Bermuda . But the much-hyped flotation fell flat by the closing bell, finishing at only 23 cents more than its expected opening price. Some market experts blamed trading problems and an anxiety-filled half hour where traders were having problems placing and cancelling orders for Facebook stocks. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg – who owns 503.6million shares in his company – is worth an estimated $19.25billion and has become one of the wealthiest people in the world in a single day.

Suicide: Richard Balentine, pictured, director of campus ministry at Notre Dame College Prep in Niles, was found hanged at around 9 a.m. yesterday in his home, which is on the school's property . An Illinois high school teacher has been found dead of an apparent suicide on his school's campus, just days before he was slated to receive a prestigious 'Teacher of the Year' award. Richard Balentine, director of campus ministry at Notre Dame College Prep in Niles, was found hanged at around 9 a.m. yesterday in his home, which is on the school's property. The popular 38-year-old teacher had last been seen at around 6 p.m. on Monday night, police said. School spokeswoman Teresa Connelly confirmed that a teacher passed away, but would not provide any more details. She said students were notified yesterday of Balentine's death. Notre Dame staff found Balentine's body in a 'lifeless state in his room' after they entered his residence near the school's sanctuary as classes were commencing, according to Niles police. The teacher is listed on the school's website as the director of campus ministry. Because of his position, he lived on campus. However, police said the area was not somewhere students passed through at any point during the school day. 'The victim appeared to have taken his own life,' police said. Niles police are currently investigating the incident with the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office. According to Bugle Newspapers, Balentine was slated to receive the Teacher of the Year Award from the Niles Chamber of Commerce during the organization's Niles Night of Roses banquet on April 27. School: The teacher was a popular member of faculty at Notre Dame College Prep, pictured in Niles, Illinois . Parent Christine Majewski Wilson said the teacher would be sorely missed by the community. 'Mr. Balentine was a great influence on both my sons, and will be missed terribly. Rest in peace and know that you will be remembered fondly and are loved and thought of by many.' Balentine is listed on website Rate My Teachers for the Niles High School, receiving an overall quality rating of three out of five stars. Most comments were positive with one unnamed person calling him 'a saint' in a 2012 review. Lifeless: Notre Dame staff found Balentine's body in a 'lifeless state in his room' after they entered his residence near the school's sanctuary on Tuesday . 'Mr. Balentine is a saint.

He can make any class fun, you learn more with him than any other teacher. If you take his class seriously he will treat you with respect. I wonder if it hurt when he fell from heaven.' The teacher had been at the school since at least 2010. Balentine had 'liked' a page called 'Suicide Prevention' on Facebook, which may have indicated he was struggling with depression. Under the profile picture, friends wrote condolences after hearing the tragic news. 'Rest in Peace Richard,' one friend wrote, while another wrote 'Terrible news.'","Richard Balentine, director of campus ministry at Notre Dame College Prep in Niles, was found hanged at around 9 a.m. yesterday in his home, which is on the school's property.

However, SNP MSP Alasdair Allan said they were ""deeply upset"" to see what had been constructed.
Western Isles Council - Comhairle nan Eilean Siar - said it wanted to apologise unreservedly to the family.
Norman MacDonald, vice chairman of the policy and resources committee, said the enclosure was the result of a communication breakdown between staff and the supplier.
Mr Allan said the pupil's parents were full of praise for his teachers.
However, they had been unhappy that for the past five years he had spent almost six hours a day inside temporary accommodation with a teacher.
The parents raised funds to help cover the costs of a safe outdoor area, which they hoped would include decking and play equipment.
Mr Allan said: ""Some months ago, the parents were deeply upset to see what had been constructed.
""It was what they describe as a small 'cage' sitting on the grass, constructed from old barriers and fencing of the type used on building sites.
""I believe that 'cage' is a reasonable description, and that this represents a failure on the part of the council to consider this young man's needs.""
He added: ""This is an incident which has caused very understandable offence to this family and raises questions about the provision in the Western Isles for children in a similar situation in future. I have raised this matter with the council by letter and await a response.""
The enclosure was taken down over the past two weeks.
The Nicolson Institute is the largest school in the Western Isles, with about 1,000 pupils.
Senior councillor Mr MacDonald said an appropriate play area would now be built at the secondary.
He said: ""I wish to apologise unreservedly on behalf of the council to the family of the boy involved.
""I think it is very clear to us and was very clear to the comhairle that the provision that was put in place was entirely inappropriate for the use to which it was going to be put.""

The man behind the Holy robe is Michael Grant, a recovering drug addict and panhandler who has been clean for one year, crediting his sobriety to finding Jesus Christ.

Love: Grant has received hundreds of messages of support from his many admirers  following his arrest . But in this case Grant said he did nothing wrong, and intends to fight. His arrest came after he went for a skate around the Dilworth Plaza skating rink. Grant then returned to his usual spot by the fountain and took some pictures with passers-by . He was approached by police and accused of solicitation, Grant later claimed on Twitter, saying he accepts tips but does not ask for money, according to NBC Philadelphia. The cop told Grant to leave the park, but he refused. Philly Jesus was then arrested. He has been charged with disorderly conduct and failure to disperse. 'Cured': Michael Grant said he only considered himself healed from drug addiction after 'surrendering to Jesus Christ' Holy man: Philly Jesus says he accepts tips from people but not ask for money as part of his shtick . Set him free: Hundreds of people have support a hashtag set up for Grant called #FreePhillyJesus . Grant is said to have recited scripture as he was taken to the police station. 'Those are charges that, in my experience, the government uses when you don't do whatever the government wants you to do, or that the police officer wants you to do,' Grant's lawyer, Charles M.

This month, the agency announced that it was opening proceedings against Armstrong and five former teammates. ""USADA can confirm that the independent three person Anti-Doping Review Board (ADRB) has conducted a full evaluation and has made a unanimous recommendation to move forward with the adjudication process in accordance with the rules,"" it said in a statement. Why fans shouldn't forgive Armstrong . If Armstrong and the others choose, the case will move next to an arbitration panel, where ""all evidence would be presented, witness testimony would be given under oath, and an independent group of arbitrators would ultimately decide the outcome of the case,"" the agency said. Armstrong has always insisted that he never took performance-enhancing drugs. Other riders accused him of using such drugs, but he has never failed a drug test. ""There is not one shred of credible evidence to support USADA's charges,"" Armstrong's attorney, Robert Luskin, said in a statement. He described the agency's decision as ""wrong"" and ""baseless."" ""In its zeal to punish Lance, USADA has sacrificed the very principles of fair play that it was created to safeguard. It has compiled a disgraceful record of arrogance, secrecy, disregard for its own protocols, shabby science, and contempt for due process,"" Luskin said. When the proceedings were announced this month, Armstrong said the Anti-Doping Agency intended to ""dredge up discredited"" allegations against him in a bid to strip him of his seven Tour de France victories. ""Unlike many of my accusers, I have competed as an endurance athlete for 25 years with no spike in performance, passed more than 500 drug tests and never failed one,"" Armstrong wrote on his website. ""That USADA ignores this fundamental distinction and charges me instead of the admitted dopers says far more about USADA, its lack of fairness and this vendetta than it does about my guilt or innocence."" According to its website, the quasi-government agency is recognized as the official anti-doping agency for Olympic, Pan American and Paralympic events in the United States. The World Triathlon Corporation suspended Armstrong this month from competing in WTC-owned and -licensed races while he's under investigation for doping. USA Triathlon said he can still compete in its events. In February, Justice Department prosecutors said they closed a criminal investigation after reviewing allegations against Armstrong. They had called witnesses to a federal grand jury in Los Angeles, but they apparently determined they lacked evidence to bring a charge that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs.

33304,"Tracey Sharp finally left the family farm she lived on with 'husband' Philip and his six 'wives' and now lives with her children in their own apartment . A mother who shared a man known as the ‘Rampant Rabbi’ with six other women has described their bizarre family life together – and explained why she finally walked out on him. Tracey Sharp, 46, claimed her ‘husband’ Philip, who has one legal wife, seven other ‘wives’ and 17 children, had ‘favourites’ and chose which woman shared his bed each night. She said he neglected her and forced her, like the rest of his women, to wear hats so that only he could see their hair. Finally she left, she claimed, because of his increasingly cold behaviour towards her. However, 53-year-old Mr Sharp, a self-proclaimed Rabbi, insisted yesterday that he told her to leave because she always insisted on being ‘top dog’ and was forever competing with the rest of his harem. Although the marriages are not legally binding, Mr Sharp, who never uses contraception, believes the women become his wives when they sleep with him. He claims to have received a message from God telling him he was a king from the Old Testament and should have many wives and children. Tracey met him in 1998 and ‘married’ him in 2001. She changed her surname to his by deed poll and went on to have two daughters with him – Naomi, nine, and Mischa, three. His other ‘wives’ also had ten children between them – on top of the five he had with his first wife – and all lived together on a farm in Whatlington, East Sussex. Although still legally separated from his legal wife Hadass, he now has six remaining ‘wives’ called Judith, Hannah, Vreni, Margo, Karyn and Chava, ranging in age from 29 to 68. The children are all home-schooled at the £675,000 farm, where the family exist on benefits of £1,500 a month, pensions and what they can make selling horses. Mr Sharp says he part-owns the property, which is up for sale, with two of his ‘wives’ and his mother-in-law. Togetherness: From left, Tracey, Judith Chava, Margo, Philip,Vreni Hannah and Karyn, with seven of the children they have had together .

He’d been a caring lover but, near the end, he was cold.’ Two years ago, she plucked up the courage to walk out on him. She is now training to be a physiotherapist and lives in Sussex. Mrs Sharp told Closer magazine that . she had made the right decision. ‘I was lonely for a long time after . leaving, but I’ll never regret it. I’m a lot happier. I love my . independence and feel stupid for getting into that set-up.’ By contrast, Mr Sharp said yesterday . that the whole family had asked Tracey to leave because her behaviour . had become intolerable. ‘Nobody could work with her because she was so . angry and nasty to people when she didn’t get what she wanted,’ he said.

He said that Tracey became angry when . he could no longer pay her child support. ‘I’m not perfect, none of us . are, but I am not anything like the man she portrays me as. I’m not a . cult leader. I don’t keep people in chains. My wives and children who . live with me are happy and are here out of choice.’ Despite all the upheaval he remains . convinced that Tracey will return to the family. ‘There’s no book giving . advice on being married to several wives at the same time so you have . to work it out as you go along. ‘I’m still deeply in love with Tracey . and I believe she’s still in love with me. I do think we will be able to . work it out and eventually will all be back.’ Another of his ‘wives’, Vreni, claimed . that Tracey went on holiday with him a few months ago. ‘She acts like a . little child. I love her, but she has her moments when she gets angry . when she doesn’t get her own way. ‘I think she left because she couldn’t . be top dog and now she’s throwing dirt.

38546,"That might not, well, quite catch on. But there is certainly a sense of down with the old regime at the Tory conference today. Philip Hammond isn't just a totally different character to the former occupant of the job, George Osborne, but he is intent on junking a fair bit of Mr Osborne's approach too.
His targets for getting rid of the deficit are being ditched. Let's face it, George Osborne missed them time and again in any case, but it is politically a big shift for Mr Hammond and Mrs May to tear up the previous borrowing rules, when balancing the books was the central mission of the government they were all part of.
Instead, there will be a new ""framework"" but sources close to Mr Hammond believe that setting specific targets is a fool's errand. But given that Mr Osborne's target was extremely unlikely to be met, the political change is perhaps bigger than what it means in practice.
But what's different too, is that the the new chancellor will also borrow money to spend it - there'll be an announcement later to borrow Â£2bn to spend on housing. There were hints that Mr Hammond might do the same to build new infrastructure.
But don't expect tens upon tens of billions of pounds of public money to gush suddenly across the land. Philip Hammond, a careful, rigorous Conservative, has not suddenly become a full-throttle Keynesian.
Nonetheless it's a distinct change to the previous administration, although whispers suggest that with the uncertainties of Brexit, George Osborne was moving towards shifting his approach before he was unceremoniously dumped.
But what's also different about Mr Hammond is his style - don't expect any flashy announcements or any flashy phrases. In fact, like the overall tone of Theresa May's government, there is a lot less flash.
Yet even in his non-dramatic fashion, he has already made pretty downbeat predictions of what might happen to the economy as the reality of life outside the EU emerges.
Whatever political promises he makes today, what happens to the economy will determine his success or failure as chancellor, and he knows, even without the uncertainties of Brexit, that's not all within his control.",There's a sigh of relief in the air as Philip Hammond announces he is to be the new chancellor.

One critic likened its appearance to a 'melted hearse' and said: 'If it were human, not even its mother could love it.' Scroll down for video . Number one: The South Korean-made SsangYong Rodius was voted the worst car of all time . Number two: G-Wiz, pictured being test driven by David Cameron, came in at number two for being 'ugly as sin - a tiny, uncomfortable box' A Top Gear review of the car said: 'Designed by a Brit, the Rodius is a vehicle of such cosmic ineptitude that it must surely have been done via pre-Skype in the days of glitching dial-up modems by a team of visually impaired misanthropes. 'The only thing worse than looking at the Rodius is driving it.' Second on the list of embarrassing motors was the Reva G-Wiz electric car which was described as 'ugly as sin'. Cheap foreign imports have also earned strong places in the list of shambolic vehicles. Bronze medal went to 'ugly duckling' the Chrysler PT Cruiser Cabriolet while fourth on the list was the Polish-made FSO Polonez. Number three: The Chrysler PT Cruiser Cabriolet was slammed by one reader as 'a novelty car that was no fun at all' Number four: The Polish-made FSO Polonez came in at fourth on the list with reader saying it 'lacked any desirability at all' Number five: Rover's City Rover was 'poorly received from the off, with its build quality coming in for particular criticism' Coming in at five on the shameful list was the Rover City Rover which was heavily criticised after being released in 2003. Japan, known for its manufacturing prowess, will no doubt want to forget number six and seven on the list- the Mitsubishi Mirage and Suzuki X-90 - which one reader said had 'zero off-road ability'. Ranked number eight in the worst cars of all time was the Morris Marina, which one reader said had 'terrible handling and poor build quality'. Number nine, the Lada Riva, was also condemned by motor fans with one saying it was 'poor to drive, uncomfortable and basic in the extreme. And last but not least was the Austin Allegro, manufactured by British Leyland from 1973 until 1982. Jeremy Clarkson once candidly said: 'Deciding which one is worse (the Austin Allegro or Morris Marina), is like deciding which leg you'd rather have amputated.' The Allegro was named 'the worst British car ever made' in a 2008 poll by The Sun but Auto Express readers have been kinder to the 1970s model, putting it last in their list. Number six: The Mitsubishi Mirage, another Japanese flop, was said to be overpriced with poor handling . Number seven: The Suzuki X-90 is not a car Japan will be proud of, with readers saying it had 'awful handling' Number eight: The Morris Marina was condemned by Auto Express readers as 'an utterly awful car' Number nine: The Lada Riva, produced in the Eastern Bloc, was said to be 'uncomfortable and basic in the extreme' Number 10: The Austin Allegro was described as 'everything bad about British car manufacturing in the seventies' Below are the top ten worst cars as voted for by Auto Express readers with their comments: . 1) SsangYong Rodius: 'It's time these were taken away and destroyed.' 2) Reva G-Wiz electric car: 'Slow, not very safe and ugly as sin. A tiny, uncomfortable box.' 3) Chrysler PT Cruiser Cabriolet: 'A real ugly duckling. A lack of refinement and driver enjoyment plus poor quality cabin. A novelty car that was no fun at all.' 4) FSO Polonez: 'Cheap, performed poorly and lacked any desirability at all.' 5) Rover City Rover: 'Poorly received from off, with build quality coming in for particular criticism.' 6) Mitsubishi Mirage: 'Poor handling and a very low-rent feel and it doesn't even have a super-cheap price to reflect that.' 7) Suzuki X-90: 'Who wanted a two-seater convertible mini-SUV? Nobody, especially when it had awful handling and zero off-road ability.' 8) Morris Marina: 'Terrible handling and poor build quality meant it was an utterly awful car,' said one reader. 9) Lada Riva: 'Poor to drive, uncomfortable and basic in the extreme. Virtually any car of the same age will trump this in any category.' 10) Austin Allegro: 'The poster child for everything bad about British car manufacturing in the seventies.

High street giant Marks & Spencer today announced it will be rolling out more price cuts across its stores to attract customers after weak homewares sales over Christmas. Like-for-like sales excluding VAT on general merchandise for last 13 weeks of 2011 were down 1.8 per cent on the previous year. M&S: Homeware sales were down for the last 13 weeks of 2011 while food sales shot up . The decline in general merchandise sales . follows a 13.3 per cent drop in the home division across all stores . after the company pulled technology products from its shelves. But M&S, which has more than 700 store in the UK, saw food sales shoot up three per cent for the same period. The City forecast a 1.5 per cent decline for general merchandise and 1.5 per cent increase for the company's food division. Campaigns: The X Factor finalists who featured in M&S's 2011 Christmas advert . M&S, which gathered all of last year's X Factor's contestants for its Christmas advertising campaign, said it would invest in promotions and sacrifice profit margins to boost trade. Video games retailer Game recorded a 12.9 per . cent decline in like-for-like sales in the eight weeks to January 7. This followed a difficult year for the chain, which saw a 10 per cent drop in sales over the course in the 49 weeks up to January 7. Game, which has 610 stores in the UK and Ireland, saw its share value plunge more than 24 per cent after it announced its sales figures. Despite the weak performance, Game still outperformed the overall games . market, which was down 13.1 per cent for the 49-week period. The group, which has 1,300 stores worldwide trading under the Game and . Gamestation brands, said that given difficult market conditions it will . not meet a banking covenant - a promise made to creditors to secure a . loan - when it is tested at the end of February. Game chief executive Ian Shepherd said: 'Our industry had an incredibly tough 2011, and so did we. 'We are adapting to the changing market and are well-prepared for the next hardware cycle.' The company is hoping that the launch of two new handheld consoles this . year - the PlayStation Vita and Nintendo Wii U - will boost sales in . 2012 after a dry patch for new hardware. Game will close 39 stores this . year and the company is on track to have gone from 610 to 550 stores in the UK by . 2013. The company has become renowned for its big budget TV adverts - hiring high-profile actors, singers and sportsmen for its campaigns. Another campaign last summer featured high-profile Hollywood stars, Green Lantern actor, Ryan Reynolds and Transformers actress Rosie Huntington-Whitely . But M&S said its expectations for full-year profit remain unchanged despite the impact its decision to invest in promotions will have on gross margins as the company plans to offset this with additional savings and 'tight management' of costs. M&S chief executive Marc Bolland said the company had 'performed well in a challenging trading environment'. The group reported a 1.1 per cent increase in clothing sales across all-stores, reported its biggest ever quarter for childrenswear, as well as strong sales of menswear and sleepwear. M&S said food sales benefited from an increased range of products as the company introduced 600 new lines. The company's website also saw sales increase 22.4 per cent, which was boosted by a move to extend the next-day delivery deadline and the launch of its Christmas Food to Order service online, which contributed to a 12 per cent increase in orders. Total group sales, which include 300 international stores, increased 2.4 per cent excluding VAT, driven by continued growth in India and China, as well as good start to its newly opened flagship store in Paris. But there was no update on the progress . of the group's £600 million revamp of it stores which it hopes will make . its outlets easier to shop in and boost sales of its own brands. Stock trend: M&S shares slumped last summer and have traded in a narrow range since then . But Matthew McEachran, analyst at Singer Capital, said overall today's update met market expectations. He said: 'Although not yet evident, . management are making progress on the new strategy, and we soon expect . to see some benefits flow through to sales and profit from enhancement . to the stores, the brand segmentation, and the navigation.'

Shares jumped 8 per cent after investors expressed relief at . the trading performance, which compared with some forecasts for a . decline of up to 2 per cent. Debenhams rolled out drastic discounts across its stores of up to 40 per cent in a . week-long promotion in November to try and boost its festive season sales. The strategy paid off after Debenhams said like-for-like sales including VAT improved by 6.5 per cent in the five weeks to December 31.

23430,"While the U.S. economy surges in 2014, posting the biggest jobs numbers in 15 years, the Russian economy is tanking straight into a recession after a bludgeon of Western sanctions. But the economic news hasn't translated to presidential approval ratings -- in either country. President Barack Obama has been facing some of his lowest job approval numbers this year while public support in Russia for President Vladimir Putin has surged over the last year to record highs. Putin's numbers aren't just high; they've surged from a 61% low in Nov. 2013 as events in Ukraine unfolded and despite sanctions hitting the country. And as opposed to Americans, a majority of Russians think their country is on the right track. A majority of Americans, 53% according to a CNN poll released last week, disapprove of Obama while 85% of Russians approve of Putin, according to a November poll from the highly cited Levada Center, an independent polling agency. Obama's struggling popularity had a concrete impact in November when his party suffered a drubbing at the polls on Election Day, despite low gas prices and the lowest unemployment numbers of his presidency. Meanwhile, the Russian government admitted this week the country should brace recession because of dramatic drops in oil prices and after a spree of Western sanctions over Russia's annexation of Crimea and its ongoing support for separatists in eastern Ukraine walloped the Russian currency and sent investors fleeing. Putin has remained defiant in the face of Western sanctions and political pressure to stand down in Ukraine. And that defiance is earning him political points at home despite the impact on the Russian economy. On Thursday Putin delivered a rallying state of the nation address in which he accused the West of replicating the Cold War containment strategy -- asserting that Western nations would have found a way to impose sanctions on Russia even without the crisis roiling in Ukraine -- and he called on Russians at home and abroad to come together. Speaking to top business leaders Wednesday, Obama appeared keenly aware of Putin's success in stirring nationalist sentiment to beat back the force international sanctions. ""If you ask me if I am optimistic that Putin suddenly changes his mindset, I don't think that will happen until the politics inside of Russia catch up to what's happening with the economy in Russia, which is part of the reason why we're going to maintain that pressure,"" Obama said, according to the International Business Times. But the political landscape Obama and Putin face couldn't be more different. Russian state media pumps out high levels of propaganda straight from the Kremlin, dissenting voices are censured and political dissenters are jailed. Ben Judah, author of ""Fragile Empire: How Russia Fell In And Out Of Love With Vladimir Putin,"" said those factors make it more difficult to gauge Russian public opinion. ""The very idea that people know about an alternative to Putin the way Americans know about an alternative to Obama like the Republicans is just laughable,"" Judah said. Judah acknowledged that there was an ""outburst of nationalist hysteria"" after Russia annexed Crimea, but said he believes Western sanctions are driving down public opinion of the Russian leader as the economy takes a hit. Henry Hale, an international affairs professor at The George Washington University specializing in Russian politics, said on the whole, the polls reflect the reality on the ground of popular support for Putin. ""I don't think Russians are really hiding their feelings,"" Hale said, adding that the polls indicate support for Putin, but not necessarily the depth of that support. Media propaganda plays a key role in bolstering Putin's popularity, Hale said, especially in the portrayal of Ukraine's popular revolt as a fascist takeover and in portraying the annexation of Crimea as, essentially, a rescue mission. While Russians have ""rallied around the leader"" in the face of Western sanctions, over time the economic impact of those sanctions could ultimately backfire on Putin. ""Over time people are going to say, 'Yeah ok we're happy with Russia being larger and its newfound role on the political stage. We're glad we have a leader standing up for us, but we also want a better economy,"" Hale said. So while the media does boost Putin's public image through ha ""barrage of positive images of him,"" economic realities will in the long term hit Putin, adding that Putin's strategy of blaming the West for hits to the economy is limited. ""After a while that starts to wear off,"" Hale said. But that could take years, he said.",President Obama has been facing his lowest job approval numbers this year. But a majority of Russians think their country is on the right track. Putin has remained defiant in the face of Western sanctions.

Chemistry student Ibrahim Al-Asiri, from Saudi Arabia, allegedly created devices that can be sewn inside the human body - and are virtually undetectable at airport security. It's these 'stealth' bombs which have sparked a worldwide airport security alert . The master explosives-maker first tried out his chilling tactics on his willing younger brother, Abdullah. Though the 22-year-old was killed, he did not hit his target. Scroll down for video . 'Invisible bomb maker': Chemistry student Ibrahim Al-Asiri, (pictured) from . Saudi Arabia, created devices that can be sewn inside the human body - . and are virtually undetectable at airport security . Alert: Families face a summer of travel chaos following a security alert over bombs that cannot be detected by airport scanners - and could face secondary checks at departure gates . Families face a summer of travel chaos following a security alert over bombs that cannot be detected by airport scanners. Intelligence sources fear Al Qaeda is plotting to smuggle the devices on to planes travelling between  Britain and America. The explosives, which have no metal parts, could be hidden in clothes or surgically implanted inside a suicide bomber. The technology is already thought to have reached British jihadists fighting in Syria and Iraq. It is feared they will return to target flights leaving the UK. The alert led to the number of sophisticated body scanners at British airports being raised from ten to 21 yesterday. At Manchester, extra machines were sent to departure gates on transatlantic flights to allow staff to swab hand luggage at boarding as well as at security. Electronic devices and footwear are being subjected to greater scrutiny. The measures are likely to lead to delays during the summer holidays when Heathrow alone has 200,000 passengers a day. David Cameron insisted yesterday that safety comes first. ‘This is something we’ve discussed with the Americans and what we have done is put in place some extra precautions and extra checks,’ said the Prime Minister. ‘The safety of the travelling public must come first. We must not take any risks with that. I hope this won’t lead to unnecessary delays but it’s very important that we always put safety first, and we do.’ Airports last night insisted planes would not be delayed – but passengers may have to arrive at gates earlier to go through the new procedures. It has also been suggested that ‘sky marshals’ – undercover armed police – could be brought in on some routes. US security blogger Lisa Simeone said security staff at Heathrow were carrying out ‘vigorous’ physical searches, as well as extra tests for explosives, similar to those in America. ‘There was also a lot of swabbing going on, people’s belongings, their clothes and shoes, they even swabbed a baby’s pushchair,’ she said. ‘People were being checked for iPhones and things like that, but the biggest difference was in the physical checking of people’s bodies.’ Delayed: The new measures are likely to lead to longer queues, delays and increased checks at airports, as well as an influx of sky marshals on some transatlantic routes . Eryk . Salvaggio, a student, said: ‘The security guys were paying a lot of . attention to everyone’s bags and items as they went through the . scanners. It seemed to take twice as long for each bag to go through, . I’ve never seen it done like that and I have travelled a lot. ‘There were a lot of bags being taken aside too, when they came out the other side, for extra searches.’ A US Department of Homeland Security official would only say the measures were a response to a ‘real time, credible’ threat. For . the past five years jihadists in Yemen have been working on . ‘artfully-concealed devices’ – explosives that contain no metal and emit . only a faint vapour and can be disguised inside items such as shoes, . soft drink bottles and clothing. Intelligence points to bombmakers from . the group Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and tutored by Al-Asiri. The . official UK threat status remains unchanged at ‘substantial’, the third . grade in a five-level rating. A Department for Transport spokesman . said: ‘We have taken the decision to step up some of our aviation . security measures. For obvious reasons, we will not be commenting in . detail on those changes. ‘The majority of passengers should not experience significant disruption.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg cautioned that the new checks were unlikely to be ‘a one-off, temporary thing’. ‘This is the world we now live in,’ he said. ‘I don’t want people to think that this is some sort of blip for a week. 'This is part of an evolving and constant review about whether the checks in our airports – and indeed other places of entry and exits from countries – keep up with what we know from intelligence and other sources about the nature of the threats we face.’ The tightening of security came as a message was posted on a Twitter page purporting to be that of a British jihadi in Iraq, saying the UK was ‘afraid’ he might come back with skills he had learned fighting with terror group ISIS. The message was posted yesterday on an account believed to belong to Nasser Muthana, from Cardiff, who appeared in an ISIS propaganda video last week. He tweeted alongside a picture of makeshift bombs.","'Evil genius' Ibrahim Al-Asiri 'created devices that can be sewn inside human body' He tried out his chilling tactics on his willing younger brother, Abdullah.

23354,"The company said it had decided to invest more than £100m in improving and expanding its Govan and Scotstoun sites.
The move ends fears over the future of the Govan shipyard.
BAE had been considering a second option of a new £200m single-site manufacturing facility at Scotstoun.
This would have meant closing the Govan yard.
Last year the company lodged planning applications for both proposals but indicated that it preferred the single-site option.
The Govan yard is currently being used to build sections of the second of the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers.
The new investment is to prepare for the Type 26 warship, being designed to replace the Royal Navy's frigates.
A BAE spokesman said: ""Following an assessment of potential facilities options, we have decided to retain and invest in both of our sites in Glasgow.
""We will work closely with our trade unions as we prepare the detailed designs to improve and expand our manufacturing facilities, which will mark the most significant investment in the Glasgow shipyards in decades.""
He added: ""Together with investments in new technologies, cutting-edge processes and new ways of working, improved infrastructure will play a key role in transforming the way we design and build complex warships.
""This will enable us to create a modern, safe and inspiring workplace for our employees, whilst ensuring we deliver equipment to the highest quality at the lowest possible cost so we can compete effectively for future UK and international orders.""
The union GMB Scotland, which represents shipbuilding workers, welcomed the news.
Senior organiser Jim Moohan said: ""The two yards working together will make Clydeside attractive for potential new customers.
""It will also sustain job security with orders for the Type 26 ships for the Royal Navy coming on stream.
""I am of the view that it will enhance our chances of securing export opportunities that have been elusive.""
Deputy First Minister John Swinney  also welcomed the move, describing BAE as ""a major player in the Scottish and UK defence industry"".
He said: ""BAE still has ambitions to seek export opportunities as well as progressing with MoD orders and Scottish Enterprise will continue to work closely with the company to offer support.""
In a joint statement, Glasgow SNP MPs Chris Stephens and Carol Monaghan said: ""This decision by BAE is a testament to the abilities of the highly skilled workforces and it is important that we recognise the world-leading expertise that we have here on the Clyde.
""We look forward to working closely with BAE in the future.""
Scottish Conservative West of Scotland MSP Annabel Goldie described the move as ""a tremendous statement of confidence"" in the United Kingdom's defence capacity.
She added: ""It is also a very welcome statement of confidence by BAE in the skills of shipyard workers in Scotland.""
Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson said: ""The council's priority is to support BAE Systems in keeping these high quality shipbuilding jobs on the Clyde.
""The investment in the Glasgow yards is testament to the professionalism and commitment of the workforce, and ensures the city will keep on producing the world's most advanced ships.""",BAE Systems has announced it will retain two of its shipyards in Glasgow.

34507,"The world was watching in 2006 when the Microsoft-designed School of the Future opened in Philadelphia and attempted to reform education. Despite having four principals, curriculum overhauls, and student technology gaps, the school graduated its first senior class last week, with every graduate having plans for institutions of higher learning. ""This isn't a school about technology, this is a school about redefining the norm for urban education,"" said Mary Cullinane, director of innovation for Microsoft Education, who is also the liaison to the school. ""We've had this saying from the very beginning: Money and technology are great, but people are better."" And everything about the state-of-the-art facility, complete with digital whiteboards and streaming video in classrooms, was created to be different from the beginning, too. The majority-minority $63 million school was erected with school district funds in the tough Parkside neighborhood in West Philadelphia. The school partnered with Microsoft on new approaches to curriculum, teaching methods and staffing. The school is made up of students chosen by a lottery of public school students, with the majority of them coming from low-income households with limited access to technology and training. The school struggled in its infancy. Its first standardized test scores last year were daunting. Less than 8 percent of 11th-graders scored proficient or higher in math, while just over 23 percent scored proficient or higher in reading. It's back to basics under the watch of Rosalind Chivis, principal for the last two school years. Regardless of the advancements, Chivis says success is in the approach. ""I don't care how good the technology is, I don't care how good the books are, the ancillary materials, if you cannot create a stellar climate conducive to good teaching and learning, it's not going to happen,"" Chivis said. ""It's about connections, it's about relationships, it's about caring."" Test scores don't tell the whole story of School of the Future, according to Cullinane. ""We wanted to take on all the challenges and still show that you could do it,"" she said, adding that the school's mission is to challenge the education status quo, all the while doing it under the same conditions as other public schools in the district. ""And today, with 100 percent of these kids having college plans, I think we showed we can do it."" The original vision called for a paperless and textbook-free school. Students were to be called learners. They would receive laptops for taking notes and tests and doing homework. Students repeated the school mission ""Continuous, Relevant, Adaptive"" with ease. ""Things did fall apart here as far as the original vision,"" said Iman Griffin, a senior and the school president, adding that students do use paper and textbooks now. ""But we aren't broken, we're still good, and I believe that I came out better."" Griffin, one of the 118 students who graduated on June 15, said she plans to attend Indiana University of Pennsylvania to study journalism. College wasn't always in the future for Mahcaiyah Wearing-Gooden. There were times during high school that she wanted to give up. She credits the caring staff and individual attention at school with helping to keep her on track. ""When I actually grasped the concept that my future is what I make it, and my future is what I do exactly, I didn't want to fail, I didn't want to give up, I wanted to succeed,"" said Wearing-Gooden, who plans to attend Green Mountain College in Vermont to study climatology.

85168,"As they prepare to go to the polls on Sunday for the second time in six months, only 3% put the need for a new administration among the country's top-priority issues, according to public pollster CIS.
The four main parties failed to reach a deal after December's inconclusive vote and there is little sign that things will change.
For Spaniards, though, a 21% rate of unemployment unsurprisingly remains the main concern.
There are signs that economic confidence is recovering as Spain emerges from the 2008-2013 double-dip recession known here as ""la crisis"".
First-quarter figures for 2016 show GDP growth of 0.8%, the same as during the second half of last year, mainly thanks to a 0.9% rise in consumer spending.
Podemos's Ikea-style appeals to Spain's youth
King calls new vote amid deadlock
Spain's 'usual suspects' line up for fresh poll
Podemos bangs on doors of power
They may embrace this partial economic recovery but Spain's voters are not crediting the conservative Popular Party (PP), which claims to have brought it about.
The PP, now a caretaker government, saw its support plummet from 45% at the height of the 2011 election to 29% on 20 December 2015.
It was enough to finish first but not to secure majority support. In the subsequent four-month lifetime of modern Spain's shortest parliament, the second-placed Socialists (PSOE) ruled out a grand coalition with the PP while negotiating a deal with the fourth-largest party, Ciudadanos (Citizens).
But repeat elections were inevitable when third-placed anti-austerity party Podemos refused to approve the deal.
46m
Population
21% Unemployment
45% Youth unemployment
2.7% Growth in GDP predicted for 2016
Opinion polls suggests little is likely to change on 26 June, although Podemos is now eyeing second place ahead of the Socialists, largely because of a coalition deal with the United Left, an amalgam of communists and other leftists.
In Sunday's Metroscopia poll published by newspaper El Pais, the PP led on 29%, Unidos Podemos had 26%, PSOE 20.5% and Ciudadanos 14.5%.
Who would make deals with whom to form a majority was a big question for the only TV debate this month ahead of the vote.
But while all four leaders were adamant they understood that Spanish patience had worn thin, they gave little away.
So with only a month of negotiating time available before Spain's traditional summer shutdown period in August, the prospect of a lost year in politics looms ever larger.
Belgium's record of 541 days without a renewed government may still be a way off, but the brinkmanship of Spanish politicians could have disastrous consequences.
""It does look like no-one wants to make a deal with anyone,"" says Pablo Simon, a politics professor at Madrid's Carlos III University. ""But I think this is basically down to electoral strategy because all the parties accept that there simply cannot be another election.""
Mr Simon argues that decisions are needed to prevent a drop in public investment and to incorporate new spending cuts demanded by the European Commission into the 2016 budget, hurriedly passed by the PP in parliament last autumn.
According to the president of Seopan, which represents Spain's construction industry, the building sector is heading towards a ninth successive year in crisis on the evidence of the first quarter of the year without a government.
""Investment in construction and infrastructure will fall by between 15% and 18% in 2016,"" Julian Nunez told a conference in Santander last week.
Beyond the delicate economic circumstances, Mr Simon also warns of the dangerous potential for political disaffection if urgently needed reforms to boost employment, improve education and crack down on corruption are not forthcoming.
""If the current blockage continues and the economic situation and inequality worsen, we could reach a point where we find that Spain is not immune to the emergence of the far right,"" he says, noting that only Spain, Portugal and Ireland have so far been unaffected by the rise of extremist politics among European nations this century.
Popular Party Acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has said the party with the most seats in Congress should be allowed to govern. His PP will again propose a broad coalition with PSOE and Ciudadanos. But the Socialists are not interested and Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera says Mr Rajoy should step aside first because of the string of PP corruption scandals that emerged while he has been leader.
Socialists Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez risks a shocking reverse if his historical party of the left is surpassed by Podemos. Polls suggest that together, Unidos Podemos and PSOE may scrape a majority or come very close. But Mr Sanchez and Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias have become bitter political enemies after the latter effectively dynamited any chance of an understanding earlier this year by insisting on an independence referendum in Catalonia, anathema to the Socialists. Mr Sanchez may have an unpalatable choice to make: be the junior partner in coalition with Unidos Podemos or allow the PP to stay in power.
Unidos Podemos The left-wing coalition wants an end to austerity politics and a massive investment in public services, as well as a minimum income guarantee for all households. This would be funded by significant tax rises for the rich and for companies. However, Mr Iglesias has hinted that a Catalonia referendum might not be a red line, a shift that would pile pressure on the Socialists to join a coalition.
Ciudadanos The anti-corruption centrist party has signed regional deals with both the PSOE and PP at a regional level, in return for a commitment to greater transparency. And leader Albert Rivera's February deal with Pedro Sanchez was a coup for Ciudadanos. But if the Socialists fade further in the polls, Mr Rivera may feel he is better served pushing for a deal with the PP, without Rajoy at its head.","Spain's voters are still unsure about the future of the country's government, despite the party's recent failure to reach a deal on austerity measures."
27957,"By . James Chapman, Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 19:17 EST, 1 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:41 EST, 2 July 2012 . Vote: David Cameron, pictured with wife Samantha at the Cornbury music festival at the weekend, could hold a referendum on Britain's future in the EU . - . David Cameron could hold a referendum on Britain’s future in the EU on the same day as the next general election in 2015 under an explosive plan being hatched by senior Conservatives. The Prime Minister yesterday opened the door to giving people their first say on Britain’s membership of Europe since 1975, although he insisted now was not the time for such a vote. Mr Cameron said he agreed with the ‘vast majority of the British people’ who were not happy with the UK’s relationship with the EU. Critics said his ‘definitely, maybe’ stance on a referendum was too vague to convince voters and appeared chiefly designed to appease Conservative MPs, who have been agitating for a referendum. But Mr Cameron said ‘tactical and strategic patience’ was required, insisting an immediate ‘in/out’ vote while Europe was in a state of flux and uncertainty was not what most people wanted. He intends to spell out this autumn a swathe of areas where he wants powers returned from Brussels to Westminster, including home affairs, employment law and social issues. Some senior Tories suggest he could later announce a referendum in which voters would be asked to endorse a looser relationship with the EU to coincide with the next general election. Although the Liberal Democrats would be likely to walk out of the Coalition, they suggest Mr Cameron could run a minority Conservative government for the last few months of the Parliament. Such a dramatic move could energise Conservative support on election day, helping to deliver the party a Commons majority, in the same way as last year’s AV referendum, which was held on the same day as local elections. Alternatively, the Prime Minister could include a pledge to hold a referendum in the next Tory election manifesto. But his admission that it is not yet clear when such a referendum might be held, or precisely what it should decide, drew scorn from Labour and some in his own party. The Prime Minister has received a letter signed by 100 Conservative MPs, who say the Government must legislate before 2015 to convince voters that it is serious about holding a referendum after the election. Downing Street sources insisted his remarks were necessarily open-ended, since it is not clear what sort of EU will emerge from the debt crisis engulfing the Continent. Breaking up is hard to do: The referendum would be the first time to question of Europe has been put to the public since 1975, when voters backed the Britain's continuing membership of the bloc . In a Sunday newspaper article, Mr Cameron acknowledged the need to ensure the UK’s position within an evolving EU has ‘the full-hearted support of the British people’. He said: ‘There is more to come – further moves, probably further treaties – where we can take forward our interests, safeguard the single market and stay out of a federal Europe. ‘As we get closer to the end point we will need to consider how best to get the full-hearted support of the British people, whether it is in a general election or a referendum. For me the two words “Europe” and “referendum” can go together, particularly if we really are proposing a change in how our country is governed, but let us get the people a real choice first.’ The Prime Minister said there were significant areas where EU powers over Britain should be handed back. ‘Put simply, for those of us outside the eurozone, far from being too little Europe, there is too much of it,’ he said. ‘Too much cost, too much bureaucracy, too much meddling in issues that belong to nation states or civil society or, indeed, individuals. ‘Whole swathes of legislation covering social issues, working time and home affairs should, in my view, be scrapped.’ Foreign Secretary William Hague said there would be a ‘very, very powerful’ case for a referendum if Europe moved towards a more federal system, as expected in response to the eurozone crisis. 'Very, very powerful': William Hague said that, if Europe moved to a more federal system, there would be a strong case for holding a referendum . But he said on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that the Government wanted to see whether it could negotiate a better relationship between the UK and Brussels, with the return of powers, before putting the matter to the British people. But Tory MP Mark Pritchard, a longstanding critic of Mr Cameron over Europe, said: ‘Once again, when it comes to Europe, it is always “jam tomorrow”. But tomorrow never comes. The PM should get an Olympic sailing gold for tacking.’ John Baron, another Conservative backbencher, said: ‘This does not go far enough, it falls short of what is required. ‘We have had too many vague commitments and promises in the past. There is a huge credibility gap – the public don’t trust politicians any more – and that is why we need a legally-binding commitment to hold a vote after the next election.’ Lib Dem sources made clear the party would not countenance a referendum while it was in power with the Conservatives – even though it was the only party to suggest an ‘in/out’ vote in its last election manifesto. Business Secretary Vince Cable said talk of an EU referendum was ‘horribly irrelevant’ with the Continent in the grip of economic crisis.","Prime Minister said he agreed with the ‘vast majority of the British people’ who were not happy with the UK’s relationship with the EU. Critics said his ‘definitely, maybe’ stance on a referendum was too vague to convince voters."
10758,"It would be the first increase since the rate was cut to near zero during the 2008 financial crisis.
However, the bank said conditions in the labour market and inflation did not yet warrant an increase.
In a press conference the Fed chair Janet Yellen said that ""most [policy-makers] are anticipating a rate increase this year"".
She added that once rates started to rise, any increases would be gradual.
The US central bank is trying to find a balance between giving clear guidance to the markets about what will prompt a rise, while not restricting its freedom to react to new economic data.
The bank said it would raise rates when it had ""seen further improvement in the labour market"" and was ""reasonably confident"" that inflation would reach its target of 2% in the ""medium term"".
Many economists expect the first rate rise to come in September, though the projections released by the Fed today show less certainty about how far rates will rise before the end of this year.
Policy makers are equally split between one, two or three rate increases this year, according to the bank's ""dot plot"", which shows where individual policy makers think the economy is heading.
Ms Yellen said that ""sometimes too much attention"" was placed on the timing of the first increase - and that the entire trajectory should be considered.
""It seems likely that some cyclical weakness in the labour market remains,"" she continued, ""although progress clearly has been achieved, room for further improvement remains"".
The jobless rate is currently at 5.5%, close to where the policy makers said it needed to be to consider raising rates.
But it is thought that this number does not reflect the full picture with many people not being counted because they are not looking for work, but would still like a job.
Ms Yellen said that, although the Federal Reserve saw the factors behind the disappointing first quarter as transitory, they ""would like to see more decisive evidence that a moderate economic growth will be sustained"".
""In the grand scheme things doesn't mark a big shift in their thinking,"" said Charles Seville, North America director at the ratings firm Fitch.
""They're sticking to their script. We expect a rate rise in September.""
Mr Seville added that the emphasis on the slow and gradual rate rises was also reassuring.","The US Federal Reserve is to raise interest rates for the first time this year, the bank has said."

It was about time someone addressed the problem of sodden greens, gloopy custard and crusty pasta dishes served in their hundreds of thousands every day on almost every flight path under the sun. That person is TV presenter, chef and cookery book author Lorraine Pascale who has spent the last six months working with Virgin Atlantic's in-flight catering departments to try to improve their meals. The upshot is a vastly superior menu for Virgin's upper class passengers and rejuvenated meals for children throughout the cabin - but  no change for those in standard class. Lorraine's upper class dishes – inspired by her love of healthy, light eating  – will include Thai beef salad with roasted pine nuts and chilli dressing or a warm salmon and lentils with chorizo dish with asparagus and balsamic dressing. The children's dishes, on rotation over the next 12 months, will include 'marvellous' mac'n'cheese with pancetta pieces, crispy tender chicken strips with potato wedges and crushed peas, sweet and sour pork balls with sunshine rice and a Mum's chilli con carne with calypso rice. Fine dining: Lorraine's Thai beef salad with  pine nuts and chilli dressing which will be for upper class flyers . Not a soggy green in sight: the TV chef has designed four kid's meals including  mac'n'cheese with pancetta . The new dishes will be showcased on Virgin's  B787-9 flight to Atlanta on October 23, then added to services departing the UK from October 28. Reuben Arnold, Brand and Customer Engagement Director at Virgin Atlantic, said: 'We are thrilled to be working with Lorraine. She is the biggest ever debut cooking writer in Britain and to be collaborating with her to create these dishes has been really inspiring. 'Dishes such as 'Mum's chilli con carne with calypso rice will hopefully get our younger passengers very excited to be eating meals with a home-cooked feel. 'All of Lorraine's dishes reflect her philosophy of food, which is to champion fresh, nutritious and simple meals – something that is so important to our customers.' Other chidlren's options will include sweet and sour pork balls with sunshine rice (above) and  chilli con carne . Lorraine Pascale says: 'I have really enjoyed working the team at Virgin on these dishes, which I very much hope customers will enjoy. The aim was to create healthy and sophisticated menus for the Upper Class customers and wholesome, delicious and fun meals for the children's offering. 'I think we've achieved it – bon appetit!' Lorraine was keen that passengers would be 'excited by what they see'. She added, 'For me, when I fly, I like to have something light, healthy and with lots and lots of flavour.' Not everyone has been enamoured by the news, however, and some have taken to Facebook to vent their ire. Princess Watson-Smith wrote underneath an announcement of the collaboration: 'So hang on, upper class get upper quality food as they can afford the upper prices?

Fraudster: Juliet Clarke swindled two boyfriends out of thousands of pounds by pretending to suffer from serious illnesses . A fraudster tricked two boyfriends out of thousands of pounds by making up elaborate lies about her personal life. Juliet Clarke told one man she was terminally ill in an attempt to make him give her money, and later pretended she had died after they broke up. She pretended to another lover, a serving soldier, that she was suffering from cancer, borrowed money for a fictional uncle's funeral and told him she had had his children. Clarke, 31, pleaded guilty to fraud at Plymouth Magistrates' Court in Devon yesterday. Magistrates heard that Clarke dated her first victim for six months in 2011. She convinced him she was terminally ill, and said that she was about to inherit £250,000 from her grandmother. But after the couple split up, he noticed that she had taken more than £1,800 from his bank account - including £259 that she spent on a holiday. When he tried to contact her, she sent him a string of messages pretending to be her father and claiming she had died. Clarke met her second victim over the internet when he was serving with the military in Afghanistan. She said she was suffering from both ovarian cancer and cervical cancer, and asked to borrow money for the funeral of an uncle who never existed. Lies: Plymouth Magistrates' Court, pictured, heard that Clarke had even pretended to be dead . When he broke up with her, she tried to get money from him by saying she was pregnant with twins. She took a picture out of a pregnancy guide and pretended it showed her swollen stomach. When her ex-boyfriend started to grow suspicious, she claimed to have had their children prematurely and sent him updates on their condition as well as photographs of them. However, it later emerged that Clarke had never been pregnant at all - and had in fact been sterilised years before. 'This is confidence fraud characterised by a degree of planning,' prosecutor Jenny Cater said. Clarke admitted three counts of fraud by false representation, and will return to court next month for sentencing.","Juliet Clarke, 31, told first boyfriend she was terminally ill and took £1,800 from his bank.

""At the moment we just want to put our heads down whenever somebody is talking about the case,"" she said.

Mariyam said: ""People know that he is related and when they say, 'We know he is related to you but we've got to say this,' I reply, 'Just say what you want,' because at the end of the day, he is behind them bars and he got what he deserved.""
She added that the men should have been given harsher sentences to make future offenders think twice.
""It makes me sick when I think about it, they're going out and they are doing that. Most of them have probably got daughters the same age as those girls.
""How can they walk out of their own houses knowing the fact that they have probably got daughters - some of them older than those girls and some younger - how can you walk out of your own door and do that to anybody's daughter?""
She added: ""For them, it doesn't matter what colour they are, whatever culture or whatever country they come from, they don't care as long as they just get it.

32523,"Some of the hundreds of sensitive documents stolen from the Pope's desk over an extended period found their way into the Italian mainstream media and into a bestselling book earlier this year.
Pope Benedict wanted closure on the Gabriele case and he got it, only hours before the start of the most important Vatican event of the year, which begins on Sunday.
He has called a three-week long Synod of Bishops from around the world to advise him on how to spearhead what the Vatican is optimistically calling ""The New Evangelisation"".
This is code for a high-octane effort by the Catholic Church to counter the insidious spread of secularism within countries - particularly in Europe - that once confidently proclaimed themselves Catholic, but where Sunday mass attendance is now falling yearly to ever-lower levels.
The butler trial has hijacked the Vatican's planned autumn religious news agenda and has concentrated world attention on yet another episode contributing to the credibility crisis affecting the Holy See.
Sunday's edition of the Vatican newspaper, Osservatore Romano, predictably put a brief report on the butler trial at the bottom of its back page.
In theory, under a treaty signed between the Vatican and Italy in 1929, people convicted of crimes carried out in Vatican territory serve their sentences in Italian jails, as there are no suitable long-term detention facilities within Vatican City State.
But if Gabriele, a Vatican citizen, were to be transferred to a jail in Italy, he might be tempted by lucrative offers to reveal other details about what he learned while in the Pope's service.
His lawyer has indicated that the former butler does not intend to appeal and is ready to serve his sentence by remaining under house arrest in his ""grace and favour"" apartment situated inside the walls of Vatican City.
However, a second embarrassing trial looms.
In about a month, the Vatican court is due to hear the case against Claudio Sciarpelletti, a computer technician who worked in the Vatican's Secretariat of State - the equivalent of the papal Cabinet Office.
He was originally charged with aiding and abetting Mr Gabriele in his theft of documents, but the Vatican judges decided to hold his trial separately.
Mr Sciarpelletti has called as one of his witnesses the first upper-level cleric - other than the Pope's personal secretary - to give evidence in the Vatileaks scandal. He's an Italian monsignor in charge of documentation in the Secretariat of State.
The Vatican prosecutor is also considering further possible, and more serious, charges against both Paolo Gabriele and Claudio Sciarpelletti - including violation of state secrets and attacking state security. These would involve heavier punishments than for aggravated theft.
The newly-appointed Vatican communications strategist, Greg Burke, formerly a Fox News TV correspondent, admits that the Pope has personally been very upset about the Vatileaks scandal.
He told the BBC: ""There are four or five people in the world who have the chance every day to talk to the Pope and get five minutes of him with no distractions. Paolo Gabriele could have done it that way. Instead, he went off and caused the scandal that it became.""","The scandal surrounding Paolo Gabriele, the former butler at the centre of the Vatican's Vatileaks scandal, has sparked a global debate about how to deal with it."
35463,"Only 18 months ago, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund faced each other in the Champions League Final. On Saturday, they clash again – but in very different circumstances. Bayern have lost none of their superpower aura since winning the treble in 2013. On the contrary, under Pep Guardiola, they are developing into an even more formidable force. One humiliation at the hands of Real Madrid aside, Bayern undoubtedly remain one of the dominant forces in European football. In Dortmund, nothing could be further from the truth. Jurgen Klopp's team languish in 15th place in the Bundesliga, with only seven points from their first nine games. More significantly, Dortmund's defence is in tatters: shapeless, error prone and lacking in confidence. At the moment, Klopp's side panic whenever they endure a set back. The fear of defeat appears to weigh over them. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Battle of the Giants: Bayern vs Dortmund preview . League leaders Bayern Munich host Borussia Dortmund on Saturday as they look to extend their unbeaten run . Borussia Dortmund lie 15th in Bundesliga with seven points from nine games after a poor start to the season . Arjen Robben (right) scored the winner as Bayern defeated Dortmund 2-1 in the 2013 Champions League final . Things have not been helped by the fact that the likes of Marco Reus, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Ilkay Gundogan have only just returned from injury, but the problems are as much psychological as anything. As Jurgen Klopp put it two weeks ago: 'we need to be more clinical in front of their goal, and have more concentration in front of ours'. Those two factors remain the two most important ones. Dortmund are pressing well as usual, and with Reus back in the side, are now playing with a renewed pace. Yet they still lack coherence at the back, perhaps due to the long term injuries to Neven Subotic, Lukasz Piszczek and Mats Hummels last season. The defence is a familiar one, but it lacks playing time together, and the communication still needs work. Up front, new strikers Ciro Immobile and Adrian Ramos have shown promise, but they are struggling to fill the gap left by Robert Lewandowski. Once again, communication is an issue, and many have questioned whether Immobile in particular fits the Klopp system. As a classical, penalty box striker, it is unclear how well he can keep up with the fluidity of Dortmund's attacks. Dortmund's Ciro Immobile (left) has failed to fill the void left by Robert Lewandowski (right) who joined Bayern . Dortmund wore their Champions League kit to break their Bundesliga 'hoodoo' but still lost 1-0 to Hannover . Their woes have been eased somewhat by a fine run of form in the Champions League and a solid 3-0 defeat of St. Pauli in the German Cup this week. But as local paper WAZ put it, 'Dortmund still need to improve'. They have tried almost everything. The players even decided to wear their special Champions League shirts in last weekend's game against Hannover, in a superstitious bid to produce a win. It didn't work. Dortmund lost 1-0 at home despite dominating the game, and their miserable league run continued. Bayern, on the other hand, are scoring goals for fun. They have scored 20 goals in their last four games, and one of those was a 0-0 draw. Arjen Robben is set to return from injury against Dortmund, while Franck Ribery made his first start for Bayern this season against Hamburg in midweek. Dortmund go into Saturday's clash against Bayern off the back of a 3-0 win vs St. Pauli in the German Cup . Despite their poor form, Dortmund did beat Bayern 2-0 in the German Supercup at the start of the season . The Reds, though, remain cautious in the build up to the Dortmund game. Pep Guardiola is famously a huge admirer of Dortmund's pacy, counter attacking football, while various figures in Munich have warned against complacency. 'This Dortmund team is always going to be dangerous,' said Thomas Muller this week, 'we're not going to be 5-0 up at half time. We have to be ruthless. Both teams know each other well, and we've had a lot of tight games in recent times.' Jurgen Klopp has already opined this season that his system tends to work better against more open, attacking teams. With a bit more space, Dortmund can utilise their counter attacks more effectively, as they did when they beat Bayern 2-0 in the German Supercup two months ago. Bayern will be boosted by the return of Franck Ribery (left) who made his first start of the season in midweek . Bayern winger Arjen Robben (left) is set to return from injury for Saturday's clash at the Allianz Arena too . That might go some way to explaining their differing form in the Champions League and the Bundesliga. Domestically, they have been overcome almost exclusively by inferior teams who set up to defend, while in Europe they have come up against better, more attacking sides such as Arsenal. Despite now being at opposite ends of the table, the rivalry between the two clubs remains as strong as ever – largely as a result of off field issues. Having already snapped up Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski from their rivals, Bayern are now flirting with the idea of poaching Marco Reus. Though no official move has yet been made for the player, Dortmund have been infuriated by repeated statements of interest from the Bayern board. A victory against their fierce rivals on Saturday could turn Dortmund's season around, particularly if they follow it up with a win against second place Borussia Monchengladbach the following week. Another two defeats, however, and Klopp's side could find themselves in the relegation zone.

18172,"In her first Easter message as PM, she said ""opportunities"" would arise from Brexit and emphasised the UK's ""shared ambitions and above all shared values"".
She said people should feel ""confident"" about Christianity's role in society and free to speak about their faith.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Easter message of peace ""could not have more urgency throughout the world"".
Mrs May, who is a vicar's daughter, said that shared values ""can and must bring us together"" following the UK's vote to leave the EU by 52% to 48% in June 2016.
""This year, after a period of intense debate over the right future for our country, there is a sense that people are coming together and uniting behind the opportunities that lie ahead,"" she said.
Mrs May, who recently criticised a decision to drop the word Easter from the name of an annual egg hunt, also spoke of her Christian upbringing in a village vicarage.
She said she learned ""compassion, community and citizenship"" but that they are values we ""all hold in common"".
""These are values that are visibly lived out every day by Christians as well as by people of other faiths or none,"" she said.
Her comments echo those of predecessor David Cameron, who used last year's Easter message to say the country must ""stand together"" and defend Christian values.
Mrs May also used her message to highlight believers in other countries who ""practise their religion in secret and often in fear"".
She said the UK has a ""strong tradition"" of religious tolerance and freedom of speech.
""We must be mindful of Christians and religious minorities around the world who do not enjoy these same freedoms,"" she said.
""We must do more to stand up for the freedom of people of all religions to practise their beliefs openly and in peace and safety.""
Mr Corbyn said Christians throughout the world would be remembering ""Jesus' example of love and sacrifice, and the Easter message of redemption and peace"".
""At a time of growing conflict, that message of peace could not have more urgency throughout the world,"" he said.
""We hear painful stories every day, of homelessness, poverty or crisis in our health service - or across the world, of the devastating consequences of war and conflict, including millions forced to become refugees.
""We need to respond to these problems head-on, through action and support for social justice, peace and reconciliation. Those principles are at the heart of Christianity.""
Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron discussed the row over the name of the egg hunt in his Easter message, suggesting it had had little to do with Christianity but was more about holding on to ""something comfortable and traditional"".
""Given that we are turning the clock back to the early 1970s with Brexit (or indeed the 1580s if we do end up declaring war on Spain), then nostalgia is most definitely the mood of the moment,"" he said.
""I don't want the Christian message to be stolen by the nostalgic nationalists, just as no Liberal should seek to appropriate Jesus for their own purposes either.
""But the Easter message is one of internationalism, if you like - Jesus died for you no matter who you are or where you are from.""
National Secular Society president Terry Sanderson said: ""We are the only country in the world with bishops in our Parliament, we have an established church, a third of our schools are Christian and we pride ourselves as one of the countries with the greatest religious freedom.
""It is therefore difficult to take seriously any suggestion that Christians in the UK are not free to talk about or practise their faith.""","Theresa May has urged people to unite behind the ""possibilities"" that lie ahead after the UK leaves the European Union."

95850,"A year-long study into the premium paid by disabled people has been unveiled.
The commission's chairman Robin Hindle Fisher has said he wants to expose unscrupulous firms overcharging disabled people.
He said there is scope for reputable firms to attract the ""purple pound"" - the spending power of disabled people.
Mr Hindle Fisher is chairman of the Extra Costs Commission, launched by the charity Scope.
The commission will look at the costs faced by disabled people ranging from a higher transport bill to the price of specialist equipment.
Scope claims that this living costs premium facing disabled people amounts to Â£550 a month. This, it claims, is not covered by the typical total of Â£360 a month available to people through the main benefits to which they are entitled.
That is a position familiar to Jean Eveleigh. She has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which leaves her prone to dislocation of her joints and also affects her digestive system.
She said she has had to buy specialist equipment including wrist splints and a foldable walking frame. Even an umbrella that clipped to her wheelchair was much more expensive then a regular brolly, she said.
""We are living for longer, the disabled community is only growing but we see the prices for disability equipment is also growing,"" she said.
""Why is everything so expensive? These are not insignificant things that people buy on a whim. They are things that people need to live, to contribute to society, and to have a quality of life that is on a par.""
She has managed to cut costs at home by shopping around for energy, but said there were still items that would help her that she could not afford.
Damon Rose, editor of BBC Ouch!, writes:
There is funding, called Disability Living Allowance (and the Personal Independence Payment is its ultimate replacement).  But Scope says it falls short of covering all of the extra costs.
It was brought in in 1991 under John Major's government. It was groundbreaking at the time as it acknowledged the extra costs disabled people faced, building on the earlier 1975 Mobility Allowance.
Such benefits come from government but other important care and support payments from local authorities are now often subject to critical needs tests, owing to austerity measures.
Mr Hindle Fisher, who has worked for 30 years in the financial services industry, said that encouraging competition among businesses to serve the sector would be one way of reducing these costs.
He said that the highlighting the size and attractiveness to business of the so-called Purple Pound - the spending power of disabled people - would encourage competition.
For example, a specialist broker in the insurance industry, Fish Insurance, finds insurance policies for disabled people.
Managing director John Garrard said that many disabled drivers had lower mileage, were more conservative drivers, and their adapted cars were less attractive for thieves.
Yet, many insurers, or price comparison websites, quoted higher premiums because the cars were considered to be ""modified"".
In fact, he said, policies could be found that meant premiums were lower than the average.
Malcolm Tarling at the Association of British Insurers said the mainstream insurance industry wanted to include as many people as possible.
However, pricing was based on risk. So any specialist and expensive equipment kept at home - whether it was for disabilities or not - meant the cost of replacement would be higher so premiums would be higher.
He encouraged people to shop around, talk to insurers, and contact a broker to secure lower-cost insurance.","Disabled people are paying more than the average monthly living costs, according to a new report."

34458,"More than 40 of those who died were pro-Russian activists who perished in a fire in a trade union building. Investigations into what caused the blaze are still ongoing.
The tragedy created deep rifts between the pro and anti-government camps in the city, and helped fuel outrage elsewhere in Ukraine, especially in the country's east, where a separatist conflict was just beginning.
Recently, a series of bomb blasts has added to the instability. Although these have caused no injuries, the uncertainty of when and where the next one might go off has heightened anxiety.
Earlier this week, police roped off a side street in central Odessa, when an unidentified bag was discovered - only to find out it contained old clothes.
Many of the explosions struck pro-government organisations, but no-one has said they carried out the attacks. Ukrainian officials blame pro-Russian ""saboteurs,"" however, and have made a number of arrests.
Fears have been increasing that a bigger incident could be in the works, as the city prepared for a number of public events - starting with the May Day holidays, then the anniversary of the trade union building fire and ending with ceremonies marking the end of World War Two.
Officials have significantly beefed up security: the city is full of additional law enforcement personnel and armoured vehicles. On the city limits, numerous checkpoints have been set up, where interior ministry forces in full battle gear inspect vehicles heading into town.
Pro-Kiev ""self-defence"" volunteer organisations have also stepped up their activities, going out on patrols by foot or car, and looking for anything or anybody ""suspicious"".
They say this could be as simple as a group of three young men, wearing track suits, with concealed faces.
The volunteers say that they have no doubt that pro-Russian elements are behind the bombings, in order to facilitate a takeover of the city by separatist or even Russian forces.
""Odessa is a strategic city for the Russian occupiers,"" said Vitaly Kozhukhar, deputy commander of one of the ""self-defence"" groups.
""The bombings are an attempt to destabilise the situation in the city,"" he adds. ""An attempt to intimidate the civilian population. An attempt to show that there are people here who want Russia to come.""
But some observers claim that the security crackdown has been bluntly applied, which only deepens the political rifts in the city. Odessa is a Black Sea port with a devil-may-care attitude, and the hope is widespread that the city will be able to recover from the recent violence, and overcome its divisions.
But some warn of what could happen if the divide persists.
""The best case scenario â€” when it will be a conflict between radicals and normal people from both sides, it will be a very big step towards peace,"" said Yuri Tkachev, the chief editor of the opposition news website Timer.
""The worst case scenario, is that we have a police state in Ukraine, and another worst case scenario is that we have civil war here in Odessa.""","The Ukrainian city of Odessa has been hit by a series of bomb attacks, which have killed more than 100 people, including pro-Russian activists."

Protesters have today defaced a controversial painting that draws attention to South African President Jacob Zuma's genitals and his reputation for promiscuity. Two men wielding cans of red and black paint walked into Johannesburg's Goodman gallery and daubed an X over the president's groin before smearing paint over his face. The painting by Brett Murray entitled 'The Spear' has been on display since early this month, but made the news only last week when it came to the attention of South Africa's governing African National Congress party. X marks the spot: A protester is caught on CCTV defacing the controversial portrait of South African Jacob Zuma at a Johannesburg gallery . Zuma filed an urgent application at the South Gauteng High Court for an order to have the portrait removed from the gallery and photographs of it taken off the City Press newspaper website. Both the gallery and the newspaper refused on the grounds it would be censorship. The matter was set to be heard today. Zuma claims portrait, which shows him fully clothed but with his genitals exposed, infringed on his constitutional rights to dignity and privacy. Zuma said he felt 'shocked, personally offended and violated' when he saw a copy of The Spear for the first time. He said the portrait depicted him as a 'a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect'. Polygamist: ANC leader Zuma is seen with three of his four wives Sizakele Khumalo (right) Nompumelo Ntuli (Left) and Thobeka Mabhija (centre) Iman Rappetti, a reporter for a South African TV channel who was in the Goodman Gallery when the men struck, said: 'Now it's completely and utterly destroyed.' Her channel showed footage of a man in a suit painting a red X over the president's genital area and then his face. Next a man in a hoodie used his hands to rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting. Rapetti said the men were detained by gallery staff and police arrived later to take them away. Rappetti said she initially thought the first man was part of a performance art piece, and that staff at the well-known gallery also were slow to react. The Goodman, which had said in a statement a day earlier that it was stepping up security, refused to comment Tuesday and closed the gallery as reporters and passers-by gathered outside its gate. The gallery's attorney, Greg Palmer, said they are going to file a charge for malicious damage to property. He said they did not know who the two men were who defaced the painting. 'The gallery has closed and they feel that their security is sufficient,' he said. Judge Fayeeza Kathree-Setiloane had been expected to begin hearing the case against the painting Tuesday. Instead, citing its national interest and the constitutional issues at stake, she said the case would start Thursday. Kathree-Setiloane and two other High Court judges, among the most senior in South Africa, will hear the case. Nearly one hundred pro-Zuma protesters were outside the court. Zuma's children asked to participate on the side of their father. Murray, the artist who painted the portrait, asked to participate alongside the Goodman. Protest: Around 100 Jacob Zuma supporters demonstrate outside Johannesburg court to demand the removal of a portrait . Speaking to the Pretoria News, Murray said he did not intend to cause any 'hurt or to harm the dignity of any person' and described his work as 'an attempt at humorous satire of political power and patriarchy within the context of other artworks in the exhibition and within the broader context of South African discourse'. The painting, a black, red and yellow acrylic on canvas priced at 120,000 rand (about $15,000), is in the style of a famous image of founder of Russian communism Lenin is part of a large exhibition of Murray's sculptures and paintings titled 'Hail to the Thief II.' The ANC has called the show an 'abuse of freedom of artistic expression.' Polygamist Mr Zuma, 70, has married six times. He currently has four wives having divorced South African cabinet minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma in 1999. Another wife, Kate Mantsho-Zuma, committed suicide in 2000.

If you haven't heard of her, she's the 20-year-old Blackpool beauty salon receptionist who became an overnight Twitter sensation last week with her ludicrously misspelled and misinformed observation on the Ukrainian crisis. If you really did miss it - and sadly for Gemma not many did - it went thus: 'If barraco barner is our president why is he getting involved with Russia, scary.' She's had more than her comeuppance for the public display of ignorance, with 7,000 re-tweets of her observation, making news as far away as Australia, a flood of comments berating her for her stupidity and the by now familiar online threats of violence and worse. Not so daft: Jenni Murray believes beautician Gemma Worrall, right, could build a career on her gaffe . She was called a stupid cow, an oxygen thief, warned not to breed and told by one particularly nasty tweeter how he would like to kill her. Then came those wishing to win political points, citing Gemma - who has 17 GCSEs and two A-levels, no less - as a product of our parlous education system. How could the nation justify the deep flaws that allowed such ignorance? Finally, the sniggers and fury died down, and there was a collective sigh of relief it wasn't one of us who'd made such an appalling gaffe. But I have a feeling it will be Gemma - and all the other beautiful girls like her - who will have the last laugh. They may, as the Yorkshire saying goes, have been at the back of the queue when the brains were handed out, but they'll probably have a far brighter future than young women who model themselves on clever old bluestockings like me. Comical error: Gemma's ludicrously misspelled and misinformed observation on the Ukrainian crisis . Think about it. Gemma's had numerous interview requests and been wooed with promises of thousands of pounds for prime-time TV appearances. To her credit - so far at least - she has resisted the temptation to make a packet from her notorious gaffe. It may, though, only be a matter of time before she succumbs to the pressure to become a public figure, given the tendency to handsomely reward the less educationally advantaged. With those 14 ditzy words, Gemma achieved what millions of well-informed girls - who could find Ukraine on a map in an instant - have failed to do. And that's to be recognised and rewarded. Times have changed and the value system seems to have gone into reverse. I call it 'being TOWIE-fied' after the millions made by the insufferably vacuous and wholly entertaining 'stars' of reality show The Only Way Is Essex. The ones who hit the headlines and make the money are those who work hard - at being in the gym or at the tanning salon. It's not brains that line your pockets or attract admiration now. Look at today's young barristers, who are striking for a day because they earn barely enough to keep them in shoe leather. Compare their earnings to those of glamour model Katie Price, TOWIE's Joey Essex and ditsy X Factor finalist Stacey Solomon. Reality TV stars: Members of the TOWIE cast have made millions from appearing to be stupid . Look at the brilliant young graduates pouring out of top universities each year who wind up working in burger bars. When I read about Gemma, it got me thinking about two young women I met at Crufts on Saturday. I had my two chihuahuas with me and had been asked to present the Toy Class trophy. They accosted me at the entrance to the Birmingham Exhibition Centre and begged me to buy a bracelet for chihuahua rescue. They were smart, charming and kind and I popped the bracelet on as I walked away. It was only later I noticed it read 'I love Chihuahua's'. Total apostrophe failure. I spent the rest of the afternoon dreading bumping into Lynne Truss, who was there too. She's the grammar and punctuation guru who wrote the bestseller, Eats, Shoots & Leaves. I'd have been so ashamed to be seen wearing such a mislaid apostrophe. When women like Lynne and I were young working-class girls, education was rigorous - and it mattered. Good exam results and a degree were our way of avoiding the kinds of lives which had so restricted our mothers - jobs as cleaners, factory workers or, at best, typists, followed by marriage, children and dependence on a husband. Last laugh? Gemma has been in demand to make media appearances . We dressed smartly, made sure our make-up was tasteful and that it would be our brains that would attract employers, who would respect our well-stocked minds and pay us accordingly. It was what society then required of us. We were expected to set aside the trivial, whether it be make-up, fashion, manicures or costly hairdos, and work hard to make our way professionally. For Lynne and me it worked. Would we manage to claw our way to the top of the CV pile now, with our perfect grammar, well-honed arguments on foreign politics and ingrained knowledge of the periodic table? I fear we might not. Women of our generation have encouraged our own children to take a similar path, only to find them burdened by student debt, struggling to find a decent job, paid peanuts if they do and with no prospect of ever saving enough money for a deposit on a house. So, is it us who have actually been the more stupid? I'm not saying that Gemma's obsession with hair extensions and make-up should replace education and hard work for other young women. But I do think more might benefit from taking up a similar career, rather than struggling along the academic route only to find no job at the end of it. For too long we've been deluded by the idea that everyone should have a degree to the detriment of our service industries. Perhaps now we'll learn to value those not suited to an academic training, but who are hugely important when the electricity goes off or the central heating fails or, in Gemma's case, when we need a makeover. These are, after all, the people we all seem to prefer watching on television; not boring old academics. Even those who don't get famous seem capable of making a far better living than better-educated counterparts - sad though that might be to say. When the sun shone last weekend, I abandoned my boots, got out the sandals and noticed what a terrible state my feet were in. I doubt I was the only 'clever girl' making an appointment for a 40-quid pedicure and 50-quid leg wax. Who's the stupid one now? And, anyway, is Gemma really as daft as some would have us believe? She may not know how to spell Barack Obama, she probably hasn't a clue where Ukraine is and thinks the Cold War is something to do with the Winter Olympics. Nevertheless, she knew that for a Western political leader to be getting involved in a dispute with Russia is scary. And that observation is not stupid at all. Maybe next time she will just be wise enough to keep her opinions to the confines of the beauty salon.","Gemma Worrall, 20, became an overnight Twitter sensation last week.

78409,"Alleged culprit: Genesis Hernandez is believed to be one of the two people behind the faked reports of offensive and racist graffiti on Vassar's campus . A string of offensive graffiti messages were made by a transgender student who was a member of a campus group that dealt bias incidents, according to Vassar College officials. One of the two known culprits was revealed as Genesis Hernandez, a transgender student in charge of the Bias Incident Response Team, and officials said that the offending pair were the ones behind some of the graffiti. The school's director of media relations told MailOnline that they have only been able to pinpoint two of the six incidents to the pair, and the investigation into the other incidents is ongoing. The pair are being held responsible to creating those two graffiti and then reporting the offensive messages to college authorities, pretending like they were not involved in their creation. Some of the messages- though it is unclear whether they were the ones attributed to the guilty pair or not- included offensive sentiments such as 'Hey Tranny. Know Your Place' and 'Avoid Being B****es'. Another message found on a student's door was 'F*** N*****', showing that gender identity was not the only bias issue being addressed by the culprit. Vassar sent out an email to students . on November 14 telling them that the school's Bias Incident Response . Team had been told of at least six different messages that were spray . painted on dorm room doors across campus. Disturbing the peace: Vassar College, in upstate New York, became concerned when six alleged instances of bias graffiti were reported, only to learn later that they were staged by the group reporting them . Adding up: The school did not formally name Genesis Hernandez as one of the individuals behind the scheme, but the transgender student dropped out of school and left his prominent positions in student government the same day . The student-led group was designed to formulate the reports and provide support for the victims. Jeff Kosmacher, Vassar director of media relations, told MailOnline the the BIRT is 'a group that gathers and discusses incidents and how the college addresses bias.' The . Daily Caller reports that five days after the initial email was sent, . the school president had to send out another saying that the bias . incidents were perpetrated by two students, one of whom was a leader of . BIRT and actively involved in student government. 'It is our unfortunate duty to report that two Vassar students have admitted responsibility for creating a number of recent bias and hate-speech messages in public spaces on campus,' Vassar president Catharine Hill wrote in the email. 'They also falsely reported these as anonymous messages. Sadly, our community has been deeply hurt by these actions.' Neither of the students' names were listed in the email and it said that they both had left the school voluntarily. Connected: Hernandez, a junior at the school, was a member of the Bias Incident Response Team and allegedly made up the reports of graffiti disparaging African Americans and transgender students . 'Evidence . showed that two students who were responsible for some of the incidents . but... we do not know if they were responsible for all of them,' Mr . Kosmacher said. He said that criminal charges against the pair are 'not in our plans at this time'. One . of the individuals involved remains a mystery, but because of the . others involvement in campus groups, the second has since been reported . to be Genesis Hernandez. Hernandez was a junior at the school and the vice president of student affairs of the Vassar Student Association, which acts as the student government. He was a leader in a number of gay and lesbian support groups on campus and is featured in a video, uploaded to Youtube by Vassar, at an equality rally. While the school's only formal statement on about the suspects was the initial email where they were not named, another clue about Hernandez's involvement came when the president of the Vassar's student government sent out an email announcing the vacated position of vice president.","Genesis Hernandez, a transgender student in charge of the Bias Incident Response Team, allegedly made up the reports of racist and offensive graffiti on Vassar College's dorm room doors.

44293,"A driver has been arrested after a woman who was walking along the M25 at 3am this morning was struck by a car and killed. The woman, in her thirties, died after she was hit by a black Volkswagen Golf as she walked along the motorway close to the Junction 13 slip road, near Staines, at 2.50am. A male driver has been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving and failing to stop. A woman died after she was hit by a vehicle as she walked along the M25 near Staines early this morning (file picture) Paramedics were quickly on the scene but the woman, who has not been named, was pronounced dead. Next of kin are yet to be informed. Police believe the driver failed to stop after the incident but was found further down the road by officers, who arrested him after he failed a breath test. He is being held in custody and will be interviewed later today. Surrey Police said it was not clear at this point why the woman was walking down the motorway. A police spokesman confirmed that the woman was local to the area and had not driven herself to the motorway. 'It doesn't appear that she's been hit by multiple vehicles, it's appears it was just the one. 'We're trying to establish whether she has walked there or whether she's been dropped off there and that is what the inquiry is focused on - what she was doing there.' The spokesman added that the force received two 999 calls from concerned members of the public in the minutes before the woman was hit. The M25 was closed anti-clockwise from Junction 14 at Heathrow Airport to Junction 12 near Chertsey, Surrey, for more than nine hours this morning, but has re-opened. Paramedics from both South East Coast and London Ambulance services were at the scene earlier this morning. A Highways Agency spokeswoman said the incident had not caused 'substantial disruption', but this could change as the morning goes on. Drivers are being diverted via the M3. Surrey Police said it was not clear at this point why the woman was walking down the motorway (file picture) A South East Coast Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'At 3am this morning we received reports that a pedestrian had been hit by a vehicle on the M25 near Junction 17. 'The incident was attended by an ambulance supported by a response car. Unfortunately the woman was pronounced dead at the scene. 'There were no other reports of injuries.' As police were dealing with the incident, a second collision involving a white minibus, a black Range Rover, a silver Vauxhall Meriva and a bronze Honda CRV, took place. The driver of the minibus, who was the sole occupant of the vehicle, was taken to St George's Hospital in Tooting with a serious leg injury and is expected to undergo surgery later today. The driver of the Range Rover was taken to St Peter's Hospital in Chertsey with a suspected neck injury. The occupants of the other vehicles involved escaped uninjured but were treated at the scene for shock.

One shot divides them after a fiercely competitive third round that swung this way and that. Mickelson walked to the first tee with a one-shot lead, which he lost after one hole, then he fell behind after four, drew level after six and regained his lead after eight.
He was ahead by two shots after 13 holes and then lost them both on the 14th. Mickelson regained the lead on 16 only to lose it again, in another dramatic two-shot swing on 17 when Stenson sickened him with a rare birdie on the brutal par three.
Mickelson made four and that's the way they finished; 12 under to 11 under. They'll do it again on Sunday, an epic joust to the end.

""I've got two thirds and a second and I'm not looking to pick up anymore of those finishes,"" said Stenson, who was runner up at Muirfield in 2013 and third at St Andrews in 2010 and Royal Birkdale in 2008.
""There's only one thing that matters. I know Phil is not going to back down and I'm certainly going to try to not back down as well.""
In the Swede, Mickelson found an opponent who steadfastly refused to go away. The American conceded he was ""a bit off"" in his game.
""I didn't have my best stuff,"" he said. ""I was a little bit jumpy and my rhythm wasn't very good. It could have been a day that got away from me, so I'm proud of that.""
True, the golf wasn't as electrifying as the 1977 vintage of Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson up the coast at Turnberry in the original 'duel in the sun', but it was intense and it was captivating.
Stenson shot 68 to Mickelson's 70. Nobody else counts. Bill Haas is the nearest rival and he's six shots adrift of Stenson and five behind his fellow American. The leaders are so far ahead they can't even see traffic in their rear-view mirror.
They walked to the first tee at 15:15 BST, Mickelson first and Stenson behind. ""Go on Stenson, lad,"" came a shout from the top of the stand overlooking the tee, quickly followed by a retaliatory holler of ""Go, Phil.""
Mickelson acknowledged his fans, Stenson just stared straight ahead. The Swede birdied the first and the third and all of a sudden we had co-leaders at Royal Troon.
Second at Muirfield - to Mickelson - three years ago and there Stenson was alongside the American again.
And there Mickelson was reloading on the fourth tee after blasting ""way right!"" on the long par five. He recovered for par; Stenson made birdie. The Swede led by one. Out there on the course there was a sense of a real duel about to take place.
Both of them walked from the fourth green to the fifth tee and they bumped fists with young fans along the way. They were already five and six shots clear of the field. Nobody else mattered bar these two. There was nowhere else you wanted to be than right there watching them.
It was strange, though. The crowds thinned and the noise died away. The golf flitted from scrambling to magisterial but there was rarely a special occasion atmosphere about it until they bore down on those closing holes and came into view of the big grandstands.
It might not have had the backdrop of thunder for much of the day, but this was fervent golf from two golfing warriors. It was terrific.
On the sixth, Mickelson hit his tee shot left and his second shot left again. He stared in wonder at that second blow, a kind of scooped slice that ended up by a TV tower. ""Love you, Phil,"" came a cry from behind the ropes as Mickelson looked into the distance. He smiled, touched the peak of his cap and walked on.
He saved his par, but Stenson couldn't. And so continued a terrific ebb and flow, a tense day that demanded nerve and mental courage as much as ball-striking. There was a psychological battle going on between them, a Ryder Cup feel to their head-to-head.
Stenson found trouble at the Postage Stamp eighth, played a bunker shot with one leg in and one leg out of the sand and failed to make par. Mickelson led by one again. Then he led by two when making birdie on 13, then he didn't lead by any after bogeying 14 to Stenson's birdie.
Earlier in the round, after Mickelson had pulled off a wondrous up and down beside the third green off a tight lie, over a bunker to a tiny target, the two men chatted about wedges on their way to the next tee.
Now there was no chat, just golfing poker. There was a swing on 16 when Mickelson birdied to hit the front again on 12 under, then a bigger swing on 17 when Mickelson bogeyed and Stenson birdied. The Swede led once more - and this time he kept it.
What would it mean to him to win? ""Massive,"" he said. ""This is the one thing I'm looking for. I give myself 50-50. It might happen, it might not happen. The sun will come up on Monday anyway. Maybe not in Scotland, but in other parts of the world...""
He smiled and left and on Sunday he might become a Major champion. It would be overdue and deserved, but what an enormous challenge lies ahead of him - with an Open champion now in pursuit.",Phil Mickelson and Phil Stenson fought back from a two-shot deficit at the Scottish Open.

40942,"James Milner is ready to shoulder extra responsibility at Manchester City with David Silva ruled out of the Manchester derby. Milner, arguably City’s best player this season, may be asked by manager Manuel Pellegrini to play in a more central role with City missing Silva’s creativity against United at the Etihad Stadium. The 28-year-old has played in nearly every outfield position during his career and would not be daunted by switching from wide to the centre if Pellegrini opts for one up front. James Milner may be given a central role in the Manchester derby after David Silva was ruled out . Milner said: ‘It doesn’t bother me where I play — I just want to be in the team. But I think my best position is in the middle and if the manager thinks I can do a job there against United then I’ll be ready. ‘I don’t know what his thoughts are but I was bought as a central midfielder and I’ve had a bit more time in there this season, though mainly I have been used wide. ‘I’d rather be in a team with David Silva than without him.

That’s the bottom line,’ he revealed. ‘This is a club that is winning things, we have great players and the fans have always been great. ‘It’s a no-brainer for me, I would love to sign a new contract. We are talking, but there hasn’t been an actual contract offer yet. ‘Obviously I’d like things to be sorted sooner rather than later, but I’m not putting a timescale on it. At the moment, all I am thinking about is keeping my place in the team. ‘You don’t expect to play every game when you’re at a club like this, but I wanted more opportunities and the manager has given them to me.

We’re quite harsh in the way we criticise ourselves. We don’t hide behind excuses. ‘There is such a long way to go and we certainly don’t feel that anything has been won or lost yet in terms of the Premier League. ‘This is a big game for us — but it’s a big game for United as well — and it’s true what they say that sometimes form counts for nothing.

39471,"According to initial reports, a suicide bomber blew himself up outside a hotel near the police district in Lahore's Qila Gujjar Singh area.
Several vehicles parked near the site of the blast caught fire and gunshots could be heard from within the police district.
A splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban said it carried out the attack.
Jamaat-ul-Ahrar [The Party of Freedom Fighters], which split from the Pakistani Taliban in August, is a territorial group of militants from Pakistan's Mohmand tribal region headed by Omar Khalid Khorasani, says the BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad.
Jamaat-ul-Ahrar claimed the attack was in response to the recent executions of some of the group's members by the Pakistani government.
The group is understood to have carried out several previous attacks on Pakistani targets, including the beheading of 23 paramilitary soldiers in February 2014.
Lahore city police chief Captain Mohammad Ameen Wains said Tuesday's attack appeared to have been caused by a suicide bomber who had intended to blow himself up inside Lahore's police headquarters but had ""blasted himself prematurely"".
He said several other people had been injured and five or six vehicles damaged.
The shots heard nearby were fired by security personnel following the blast, the Dawn website reported.
Lahore is one of Pakistan's most liberal cities and has seen relatively few attacks in recent years.
Pakistan has suffered two major militant attacks in the last month.
At least 60 people were killed in an attack on a Shia mosque on 30 January in the southern province of Sindh, and a Taliban attack on a Shia mosque in the city of Peshawar on last Friday killed 20.","A suicide bomber has attacked a police station in the Pakistani city of Lahore, killing at least eight people, police say."

He spoke as a grand jury announced no charges for a white police officer who shot and killed the unarmed teenager.
The incident sparked a nationwide dialogue about race relations.
St Louis County Police spokesman Brian Schellman told US media on Tuesday authorities want to talk to Mr Head about his comments amid a larger investigation into arson and looting during the Ferguson protests.
Twelve commercial buildings were destroyed by fire that night, after the jury's decision was announced.
Family attorney Benjamin Crump has called Mr Head's recorded comments ""raw emotion"".
The officer who shot Brown in Ferguson, Darren Wilson, resigned from the force over the weekend.
The policeman said he had feared for his life, but Brown's supporters said the teenager was attempting to surrender when he was shot.
Some witnesses said the 18-year-old, who was unarmed, had his hands up.
The investigation into Mr Head comes one day after President Barack Obama requested $263m (Â£167m) to improve police training, pay for body cameras and restore trust in policing.

These are just some of the exciting examples of what ""augmented reality"" (AR) technology is beginning to offer us.
This clumsy phrase just means overlaying digital information onto the physical world via an electronic device, whether that's a mobile phone, tablet or smart glasses.
No wonder Microsoft and Magic Leap - backed by Google and Alibaba - prefer to call it ""mixed reality"".
In time, it will allow us to interact with a world that is enhanced by multimedia provided by very clever computers - reality, only better.
""In five years, people expect the screen to be replaced by artificial intelligence - a virtual private assistant interacting with us via AR glasses,"" says Esmeralda Swartz, vice-president of marketing, enterprise and cloud at communications firm, Ericsson.
Smart sensors and the internet of things will transform ""the city of the future into a portal we interact with,"" says Ms Swartz.""
And with AR, unlike the totally immersive virtual reality (VR), we can still see what's going on around us. We can move about, whereas VR users are restricted to a small area. This means AR has more immediate practical applications for business.
Google Glass blazed a trail for this kind of tech, even though the BBC's Technology correspondent concluded it was ""a fascinating failure"" - the monocular design being deemed too weird for most consumers.
Surprisingly, tech firm Vuzix is adopting a similar approach.
But a number of other companies are now producing stereoscopic smart glasses or head-mounted displays that have potential uses in business, education, health, defence, retail and science.
For example, Meta recently showed off its new, rather bulky, headset at the TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference in Vancouver, Canada.
And Osterhout Design Group (ODG), a tech firm with a history of creating night vision goggles and heads-up displays for the US military, describes its latest R7 glasses as ""a tablet you wear on your head"".
The experience created by the two stereoscopic displays is ""like a 70-inch TV screen floating roughly 6ft (1.8m) in front of you,"" says ODG's chief operating officer, Pete Jameson. Users operate the glasses in conjunction with a wireless hand-held controller.
One of its users, Optech 4D, has created software that integrates with the glasses to help maintenance engineers in the oil and gas industry.
The glasses recognise the piece of equipment, bring up its service history on screen, and show the relevant maintenance procedures.
""The ability to have line of sight is very important so you don't have to look away from what you're doing,"" says Mr Jameson. And this is one of the key advantages of smart glasses in an industrial context.
Some of the more surprising applications of their glasses, which come with a list price of $2,750 (Â£1,950), include improving the eyesight of people with macular degeneration, adds Mr Jameson.
Microsoft's HoloLens, the latest version of which will shortly be released to developers at a cost of about $3,000, has already attracted commercial partners, such as car manufacturer Volvo and design software company Autodesk.
Nasa is already using a couple of the holographic headsets on the International Space Station, giving astronauts the ability to access mission control information and instruction manuals without being stuck in front of a computer monitor.
And scientists are using video footage and measurements taken by Mars rovers - mobile robots on the planet's surface - to create a virtual world that they can inhabit, meet and work in while wearing HoloLens headsets.
In the US, Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic are using the headsets to teach anatomy to students. The teacher and students can view the same 3D models and add layers of detail or focus on specific organs.
""We do believe the future is holographic,"" a Microsoft spokeswoman tells the BBC. ""We're going to have experiences that extend and complement 2D experiences, but we also imagine a future without screens.""
Augmented reality on expensive headsets is one thing - and that may be the future - but what about applications on cheaper mobile devices?
We've seen how static images can come alive as 3D animations just by holding your phone's camera over adverts, courtesy of companies like Blippar.
And retailers such as Ikea have also been experimenting with AR - enabling you to see what that two-seater sofa would look like against that wall, or over there by the TV. And virtual fitting rooms are allowing us to try on clothes remotely.
Cimagine, a tech company that has developed an AR platform for retailers, numbers Shopdirect.com and John Lewis among its clients.
Its software takes images of the retailer's digital product catalogue and superimposes them onto whatever your phone or tablet camera is looking at.
""Our software scans the room 60 times a second and keeps the virtual objects anchored to their positions,"" says chief executive and founder Yoni Nevo. ""And our tracking and rendering engine makes products very lifelike - it's like they're actually there in the room.""
As well as helping consumers visualise what products might look like in various places in their homes, Cimagine is helping companies sell products to other businesses.
For example, Coca-Cola uses the software to show restaurants and cinemas what its drinks vending machines might look like in different positions.
""Now they can close a deal after just one visit rather than three,"" says Mr Nevo.
Augmented, or mixed, reality ""is going to be massive,"" concludes ODG's Pete Jameson.
""It's going to start out in the enterprise market then start to move in the consumer environment faster than we think.""

8022,"Japan is prepared to gradually reduce the amount of oil it imports from Iran, Finance Minister Jun Azumi said Thursday, as the United States seeks to muster international support to put fresh pressure on Tehran over its nuclear program. Japan imports 10% of its crude oil from Iran at the moment, Azumi said at a news briefing after meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. The country is ready to decrease that level ""in a planned manner,"" he said. ""What I told the secretary is that we have already reduced Iranian oil imports by 40% in the past five years,"" Azumi said, standing next to Geithner. ""The nuclear development issue is an issue that the international community cannot overlook, so we very much understand the U.S. action."" The United States is exploring ways to cut off Iran's central bank from the global financial system and reduce the country's oil revenues, Geithner said at the briefing. Washington is in ""the initial stages of consulting with allies around the world about how best to achieve those goals,"" he said, adding that Japan's support was appreciated. ""We are working very closely with Europe and Japan and countries around the world to substantially increase the pressure we bring on Iran,"" Geithner said. The announcement is a plus for Geithner, after his efforts on Iran were rebuffed by senior Chinese officials during his visit to Asian countries this week. ""I think 'small victory' is a fair categorization,"" said Michael Levi, a Council on Foreign Relations' expert on energy policy and national security. From January to September 2011, Iran exported 13% of its crude oil to Japan, according to the International Energy Agency. Levi said Iran is likely to absorb this and find alternatives","Japan imports 10% of its crude oil from Iran at the moment, Finance Minister Jun Azumi says.

9890,"A team at the Institute of Cancer Research, London, have developed a new technique for measuring the diversity within a cancer.
They showed ""extraordinary"" differences between cancerous cells and say new targeted drugs may fail as they may be unable to kill all the mutated tissue.
Experts said the findings would have ""profound implications"" for treatments.
A tumour starts as a single cell, which acquires mutations and eventually divides uncontrollably. But that is not the end of the process.
Cancerous cells continue to mutate and become more aggressive, move round the body and resist drugs.
This process is chaotic and results in a ""diverse"" tumour containing cancerous cells that have mutated in different ways.
""This has huge implications for medicine,"" researcher Prof Mel Greaves told the BBC.
His team at the Institute of Cancer Research investigated cancer diversity in five children with leukaemia. They compared mutations in individual cancerous cells with a known database of mutations.
Their results, published in the journal Genome Research, showed patients had between two and 10 genetically distinct leukaemias.
Prof Greaves said: ""Every patient has a completely new tree and doesn't have one cancer, they have multiple cancers.
""This is really a technical advance to get at this extraordinary complex diversity, it helps explain why we have such difficulty with advanced diseases.""
Scientists compare cancer diversity to a tree. The initial mutations - the trunk - will be common to all cancer cells. But then the tumour branches out.
It means a treatment that targets one ""branch"" or sub-clone of the cancer might slow the disease, but they will never stop it.
Prof Charles Swanton, who researches diversity at the University College London Cancer Institute, told the BBC: ""We call it pruning the branches not cutting down the tree, targeted therapies will remove some of the sub-clones, but chopping down the tree is hard to do.""
The study investigated leukaemia as it is less diverse than other types of cancer. Other tumours such as melanoma could feasibly be made of hundreds of branches.
Prof Greaves says one implication of the research is that therapies need to be developed which target the trunk of the tumour and that current targeted therapies being researched may not tackle advanced cancers.
Another idea he suggests is focusing on the cancer's surroundings as well.
""If it is diversifying like species in a habitat, why not target the habitat - the blood vessels supplying oxygen or inflammation. There's a lot of interest in that,"" he said.
The research also emphasises the importance of catching cancers early before they have become too diverse to treat.
Prof Charles Swanton argues: ""The bottom line is we need to understand cancer diversity to limit further adaptations, reduce the pace of evolution and prolong the activity of drugs.""
Prof Chris Bunce, the research director at Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research, commented: ""We are beginning to understand how unique and complex each patient's cancer is and the profound implications that this can have on the success of treatment.
""This study significantly advances our understanding of how cancers start and evolve.""","The complexity of a cancer's cells may be the reason why we have such difficulty with advanced diseases, scientists say."
10485,"Fiji's interim leader Frank Bainimarama says talks are under way to negotiate the release of the hostages.
The UN peacekeepers were detained near Quneitra, during heavy fighting between Syrian rebels and government forces.
Meanwhile, the Philippines says 75 of its peacekeepers remain in a tense standoff with rebels in the same area.
The UN Disengagement Observer Force (Undof) base is surrounded by militants but the Philippine peacekeepers have refused to surrender, army spokesman Gen Domingo Tutaan Junior confirmed on Friday.
It is not yet clear which armed group is holding the peacekeepers.
Activists say the gunmen include members of the al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda's offshoot in Syria.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon strongly condemned on Thursday ""the restriction of movement of Undof peacekeepers by armed elements of the opposition in two positions in the vicinity of al-Ruwayhina and Burayqa"".
The UN Security Council also ""demanded the unconditional and immediate release of all the detained United Nations peacekeepers,"" in a statement.
Fijian Commander Brig Gen Mosese Tikoitoga said the 43 peacekeepers currently being detained were believed to be alive and unharmed.
""I want to assure the families of the soldiers we are doing everything possible to secure their safe return,"" Mr Bainimarama said on Friday, adding that talks had begun to secure their release.
Three vehicles with some 150 armed rebels approached the Fijian camp early on Thursday and took the peacekeepers briefly to an undisclosed location before transporting them back to their original post, Brig Gen Tikoitoga said.
The Philippines military said the rebels had encircled its camp with the Fijians in tow, and demanded the Filipino peacekeepers surrender their weapons, which they refused to do.
""We can use deadly force in defence of the UN facilities,"" Philippines commander Col Roberto Ancan told reporters on Friday.
He described them ""well-armed, well-trained"" and said they were ""warrior peacekeepers"".
The two UN encampments are about 4 km (2.5 miles) apart.
The development comes two days after Syrian rebels seized a crossing into the Israeli-occupied Golan after a long battle.
Undof positions were hit by mortars during the fighting, but no casualties there were reported.
This is not the first time Undof personnel have been detained by rebel fighters in recent years. Peacekeepers were detained in March and May last year and were released safely.
The Golan Heights, a rocky plateau in south-western Syria, has a political and strategic significance that belies its size.
Israel seized the region in the closing stages of the 1967 Six-Day War, and thwarted a Syrian attempt to retake it in 1973.
Both countries signed an armistice in 1974, after which Undof was put in place to monitor the demilitarised zone.

40454,"By . Rachel Quigley . PUBLISHED: . 16:40 EST, 13 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:52 EST, 13 December 2012 . A woman whose life was changed forever after a 'love doctor' mutilated her genitals is writing a book about her ordeal and the doctor she trusted to perform the routine procedure. Cheryl Sexton Dillon, from Ohio, was happily married with three children when she was 36-years-old.  But her happiness was ruined when Dr James C. Burt recommended she get a hysterectomy when all she needed was minor bladder surgery. What followed was not just a hysterectomy, but a nine-hour operation in which her genitalia was totally mutilated - with her vagina relocated and her clitoral hood removed. Speaking to ABC about the 1984 procedure, she said: 'I thought I would die. The pain was unlike anything I had ever experienced in places I couldn't understand. Trauma: Cheryl Dillon did not just get a hysterectomy, but a nine-hour operation in which her genitalia was totally mutilated - with her vagina relocated and her clitoral hood remove . 'When I went to Dr Burt and asked, ""What have you done?"" he said, ""What are you talking about?"" I found out from other doctors that I had been mutilated.' One doctor said her genitals looked like 'a fileted fish'. Ordinary activities were impossible like sitting down and wearing pants. Having sex with her husband was excruciatingly painful and because of it, her 12-year marriage fell apart. Dr Burt was a respected ob/gyn at St Elizabeth's Hospital in Dayton, Ohio, and an advocate of redesigning women's genitalia to improve their sex life. He even wrote a book about it in 1975 called Surgery of Love, the proponent of which was: 'Women are structurally inadequate for intercourse. This is a pathological condition amenable to surgery.' He performed countless operations on women, leaving most of them horribly disfigured, for almost 20 years until he surrendered his medical license in 1989 following a barrage of complaints and lawsuits. In 1988, the Ohio Medical Board cited Burt for alleged 'experimental and medical unnecessary surgical procedures, in some incidents without proper patient consent', as many women believed they were going through routine procedures like post-pregnancy repairs and hysterectomies. St Elizabeth's Hospital began requiring Burt to use a 'a special consent form specific to love surgery' in 1979, according to ABC News. He himself admitted he did not always get proper consent for some of his earliest surgeries. Dr Burt is now 91-years-old and bankrupt. He declined to comment on the article. The surgeon she trusted: Dr James C. Burt was an eccentric but respected ob/gyn at St Elizabeth's Hospital in Dayton, Ohio, and was a proponent of procedures to redesign women's genitalia . His son  James C. Burt III, 68, of Los Angeles, defended his father's medical practices to ABC: 'There are hundreds and hundreds of Dr Burt's patients, alive today, whose marriages and lives were dramatically improved by his wholesome restoration to their fully functioning sexual responsiveness, which most of those patients had previously enjoyed earlier in their marriages. 'Until there are those in the media or the medical profession who are willing to look at the successful results, which fully benefited the lives of countless numbers of his patients, there should and will be no further comment on behalf of Dr Burt or his family.' Dillon eventually settled out of court with St Elizabeth's Hospital. She was one of the first to file a malpractice lawsuit against them and Burt in 1985. She is now writing a book about her experience. When the now-65-year-old first went to Burt, Dillon was already in a happy second marriage with three children. He told her, 'You don't really need to have more kids'. 'I went ahead and got a hysterectomy,' Dillon said. 'You trust your doctor'. After weeks of constant pain, she went to see another doctor for a second opinion. She explains: I asked for the best doctor, because I had to find out what was wrong with me. He looked at me and called in one of the nurses and said, ""Have you ever seen anything like this?"" 'He had repositioned my vagina and circumcised me. The doctor said he had never seen it anywhere except in African tribes. 'The way I was deformed, I couldn't have sex. I ended up going through three different corrective surgeries but by that time, my marriage was shot and I lost the best thing that had happened in my life.' When she went public with her story a number of other women came forward with similar stories. Several other women filed malpractice lawsuits against Burt, but according to the New York Times, many of the cases were dropped because doctors would not testify. Dillon has moved back to Ohio to care for her elderly parents who both have Alzheimer's. Though she says she still lives with the effects of what happened: 'My life has taken a lot of different turns and ups and downs. So much of it happened because of that part of my life.'",Cheryl Sexton Dillon was 36 when Dr James C. Burt recommended she get a hysterectomy when all she needed was minor bladder surgery.

She accepted EU nations could choose to impose new restrictions, including requiring Britons to apply for permission before travelling.
Ms Rudd said it was a ""given"" people voted Leave to reduce immigration.
Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, she reiterated the prime minister's dismissal of a points-based system to control EU migration championed by Brexit campaigners in the build-up to the referendum, saying it ""simply doesn't work"".
She said her department was considering the alternative of requiring EU migrants to have work permits.
""Whether we look at a work permit system or another system is something that my department is looking at closely at the moment,"" she said.
Asked about a possible trade-off between curbing the free movement of people and being allowed access to the EU's single market, Ms Rudd said the UK will have ""complete control"" over numbers once it leaves the EU, ""with one or two provisos"".
The new model ""has got to be reciprocal"", she said.
""We are going to have to work out what's in the UK's interests as well going to the European Union and what works for our economy and making sure that we get the right balance.""
Asked about the Conservatives' long-standing target to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands - latest figures had it at 327,000 - she said the government was ""completely committed"" to reducing immigration, and ""yes tens of thousands, although it will take some time"".
She also confirmed the government was looking at ways of reducing the number of people using student visas to come to the UK, but said there would be ""no blanket ban"".
The home secretary said reports that Britons may have to pay for permission to visit the EU after Brexit were ""a reminder that this is a two-way negotiation"" adding: ""I don't think it is particularly desirable but we do not rule it out because we have to be given a free hand.""
Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham said such a proposal could cost a British family visiting the EU Â£50.
""This is yet another example of the drift and confusion as a result of the government's failure to plan for Brexit,"" he added.
Ms Rudd, one of the leading voices in the Remain campaign ahead of the referendum, played down her attacks on Leave campaigner Boris Johnson, who is now foreign secretary.
Asked about her comment in a TV debate that Mr Johnson was ""the life and soul of the party"" but ""not the man you want driving you home at the end of the evening"", she said: ""Boris is not the the driver, Theresa May is the driver.

A judge told the youngster he was concerned he ""may have been affected by material available to you [online]"".
The boy, from Blackpool, was given a four-year sentence at Preston Crown Court.
Judge Mark Brown said the boy, who earlier pleaded guilty to rape and sexual assault, would have received a considerably longer sentence if he had been an adult.
He said the boy was not ""experimenting sexually"" but rather was ""obtaining sexual gratification or pleasure"" by assaulting the children.
The nine-year-old victim had been sexually assaulted in his bedroom ""on a number of occasions over a period of some time"" and rapes had also taken place, the court was told.
Judge Brown told the boy it was ""a terrible and dreadful thing you did to him and I hope you appreciate it should never have happened.""
The court was told that while on bail, the boy had committed another assault.
The court heard that a pre-sentence report indicated the boy was a ""high"" risk for committing further offences and he would be subject to notification requirements under the Sexual Offences Act upon release.
Virginia Hayton, defending, said her client ""clearly needs help and support"" but had been using his time in custody productively.
She said there were ""concerns about his upbringing"" but conceded he was aware of his actions and his ""desire outweighed the knowledge and remorse of what he was doing"".

The announcement does not mention the sexual harassment allegations, which have now come from multiple Fox presenters.
Executive chairman Rupert Murdoch wrote that Mr Ailes has made a ""remarkable contribution"" to Fox News.
""We continue our commitment to maintaining a work environment based on trust and respect,"" Fox executives Lachlan Murdoch and James Murdoch said in the statement. ""We take seriously our responsibility to uphold these traditional, long-standing values of our company.""
Roger Ailes has long been viewed one of America's most powerful conservatives. The one-time media consultant to Richard Nixon was the key figure in building the Fox News channel into a ratings, profits and, most important perhaps, political powerhouse.
Prior to his dramatic and embarrassing downfall, Mr Ailes was said to be one of the few employees that Rupert Murdoch actually feared. But it was the media mogul's admiration for his long-time lieutenant and ideological soul-mate that came through in the warm statement released by Fox News Channel's parent company, 21st Century Fox.
""His grasp of policy and his ability to make profoundly important issues accessible to a broader audience stand in stark contrast to the self-serving elitism that characterises far too much of the media,"" said Rupert Murdoch, in a tribute that did not touch upon the allegations of sexual harassment against the former news chief. Noticeably, it was left to Mr Murdoch's sons, Lachlan and James, to point out that the company is committed  ""to maintaining a work environment based on trust and respect.""
I'm told by a source close to the company that the Murdochs wanted to move quickly, a lesson learnt from the handling of the phone hacking scandal.
It's also measure of the importance that Mr Murdoch attaches to the Fox News channel that he is personally taking over as chairman and acting CEO after losing one of the central figures in his global media empire. What makes Mr Ailes' departure all the more dramatic is that it should happen on the final day of the Republican convention at a time when a deeply divided conservative movement was already in such a state of flux.
Mr Ailes, 76, said he was stepping down because he had become a ""distraction"".
""I will not allow my presence to become a distraction from the work that must be done every day,"" Mr Ailes wrote in a letter to Rupert Murdoch.
He has run Fox News since it launched in 1996 and is credited with reshaping the American media and political landscape.
A veteran of Republican political campaigns, he turned the cable news network into a ratings leader and an influential force in the Republican Party.
""Rupert Murdoch is a conservative, but the Republican intensity, the conservative passion including the viciousness toward the Democrats that we now see against Hillary Clinton and has been going on against Obama all these years, all that is Roger Ailes,'' Paul Levinson, communications professor at Fordham University, told the AP news agency.
Less than two weeks ago former presenter Gretchen Carlson sued Mr Ailes for sexual harassment and wrongful termination, claims he denies.
Ms Carlson, who worked for the network for 11 years, alleges that he proposed having a sexual relationship with her and he instructed her to turn around in his office so he could look at her backside.
Mr Ailes also allegedly called her a ""man hater"" and that she needed to ""get along with the boys"".
A report in New York magazine, citing anonymous sources, said lawyers for 21st Century Fox gave Mr Ailes a deadline of 1 August to resign or face being fired.
Further allegations surfaced in US media that Mr Ailes sexually harassed another Fox News presenter, Megyn Kelly, about 10 years ago, claims he has also denied.",Former Fox News chief Roger Ailes has resigned from his job as chairman and acting CEO.

That message has been resonating throughout the Pakistani countryside, where the culture is deeply conservative and the people are desperately poor. In farmlands just 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the center of Islamabad, Mohammed Daoud and his 15-year-old son Faisal eke out a living by cutting grass for their four water buffalo. They feed their family of seven, earning the equivalent of around $50 a month by selling buffalo milk. Two months ago, Daoud said, the government bulldozed his family's house, probably because they were illegally squatting on property they did not own. ""Justice [in Pakistan] is only for people who have money,"" Daoud said, while slicing through handfuls of grass with a small scythe. ""We are illiterate,"" he added, ""but we are hoping that with Islamic sharia law, our lives will get better."" Across this overwhelmingly Muslim country, there is widespread hope that adopting a strict code of law based on the Koran will transform a society where corruption is rampant and where at least a quarter of the population lives under the poverty line. Watch why the Taliban's message would resonate . Enforcement of sharia law is the platform the Taliban have been using to justify recent land-grabs, such as last week's armed occupation of the district of Buner, some 60 miles from the Pakistani capital. In an interview with CNN, Muslim Khan, the Taliban spokesman in the militant stronghold of Swat Valley, denounced the Pakistani government, calling the prime minister and lawmakers ""un-Islamic."" ""They're making money like in a supermarket,"" Khan said, adding that under sharia law both the rich and the poor would be treated equally. Militants have slowly taken over territory in northwestern Pakistan by first targeting unpopular landlords and bureaucrats, according to Amnesty International, the human rights watchdog. ""Its systematic. The Taliban move into an area, they use local existing resentments. They often go in with the guise of being Robin Hoods,"" said Amnesty International representative Sam Zarifi. ""They scare away some local thieves, they impose very, very quick justice, very harsh justice, and initially in some places they are even welcomed.""

59206,"By . David Williams and Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 18:37 EST, 26 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:02 EST, 26 April 2013 . David Cameron yesterday warned that the furore over false intelligence about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction was stopping Western leaders getting tough with Syria. After accusing Syria’s Bashar al-Assad of war crimes by using the chemical weapon sarin, he admitted the WMD blunders made by Tony Blair’s government offered an excuse for leaders to do nothing. Mr Cameron said: ‘I do worry about that. I think the Iraq lesson must be about how we marshal and use information and intelligence and I think that lesson has been learned. Crisis: As the Syrian civil war rages on, this week the Obama administration announced that as well as conventional weapons, President Assad has used chemical weapons on civilians . Recent interview: President Bashar Assad accused the West on Wednesday of backing al-Qaeda in his country's civil war this week . ‘But I think it is very important for politicians and leaders of this generation to look at what is happening in Syria and ask ourselves what more we can do.’ Earlier Mr Cameron ramped up the rhetoric against Assad over the alleged use of sarin. ‘It is extremely serious, this is a war crime, and we should take it very seriously,’ he said. He echoed Barack Obama by warning ‘this should form for the international community a red line for us to do more’. That is code for military intervention by the West. His statements make British and US air strikes far more likely and officials admit that imposing a ‘no-fly zone’ over Syria is definitely ‘on the table’ for top-level discussion. However, Mr Cameron ruled out sending British troops into Syria saying: ‘Do I think putting troops on the ground in Syria is the right thing to do, as we did in Iraq and Afghanistan? No, I don’t. Should we be working with our allies, the French, Americans, others in the Gulf to support the responsible part of the opposition, do everything we can? To train them, to work with them so they can support their people, to put pressure on the regime? Yes, we should.’ Criticism: David Cameron, right, openly said that the misuse of intelligence under Tony Blair, left, was discouraging leaders from acting over the Syrian civil war . Mr Cameron is expected to lead a National Security Council meeting and talk to Mr Obama next week. National Security Adviser Sir Kim Darroch held video conferences this week with his American opposite number Tom Donilon. Meanwhile, Government scientists at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down, Wiltshire, have analysed samples smuggled out of Syria and confirmed they are sarin.The samples probably include ones from the Syrian government’s attack on April 13 near the city of Aleppo. MI6 officers are also working with the CIA to gather intelligence on the exact circumstances in which chemical weapons were used. Dilemma: President Barack Obama faces a hard decision over the ongoing situation in Syria as he said that use of chemical weapons by Assad was the 'red line' British diplomats want to present concrete evidence to the UN Security Council that chemical weapons were used. They need to secure support from Russia for international intervention. Moscow has so far blocked UN action. Asked if air strikes and a no-fly zone are under consideration, a senior Government source said: ‘Nothing is off the table. These are issues that we will be exploring with our allies. The priority is to obtain the full facts. 'The Russians have previously taken the same view as us on the use of chemical weapons so there may be an opportunity to get some movement at the UN. But before we make that case we need the full facts.’ It is feared that Syria’s large arsenal of chemical weapons,  approximately 1,000 tons, stored in 50 towns and cities, could fall into the hands of Al Qaeda. US special forces are understood to have devised plans to seize control of the arsenal, but sources here denied Britain will help them. Despite the mounting evidence Syria continues to deny using chemical weapons. Syrian official Sharif Shehadeh called the US claims ‘lies’ and likened them to false accusations that Iraq possessed weapons of  mass destruction ahead of the  US-led invasion.",President Barack Obama said use of chemical weapons by Assad was 'red line' Mr Cameron said misuse of intelligence was discouraging leaders from acting.

51821,"By . Richard Gibson . PUBLISHED: . 17:48 EST, 15 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:48 EST, 15 February 2014 . James Anderson felt this winter’s Ashes pain more keenly than his England team-mates — because he played the majority of the 5-0 whitewash with a broken rib. Although the injury was kept quiet, it has prevented him bowling a ball in the six weeks since returning from Australia. The Lancashire fast bowler, second on England’s Test all-time wickettakers’ list behind Sir Ian Botham, was struck while attempting to pull a Peter Siddle short ball in the second Test at Adelaide. Ouch: James Anderson is hit by a short delivery from Australia's Peter Siddle in the second Ashes Test, which broke his rib . Painful memory: Anderson looks dejected after having 28 runs hit off his over by Australia's George Bailey in the third Ashes Test . ‘It was suspected that it was broken straight away but it wasn’t confirmed until ahead of the fourth Test in Melbourne when it was decided to get an X-ray done,’ said an England source. ‘There’s nothing you can do to treat broken ribs anyway, so it was a case of just getting on with things.’ The medical staff got the damaged area scanned after Anderson reported increased discomfort ahead of the Boxing Day Test at the MCG. The 31-year-old played through the discomfort on a concoction of painkillers and adrenalin but failed to reach the heights of the 2010-11 series, when he finished as the most prolific bowler on either side, claiming 23 victims in England’s 3-1 win. Familiar sight: Anderson walks back to his mark during the troubled Ashes series in Australia . Rare moment: Anderson celebrates taking the scalp of Shane Watson but wickets were hard to come by during the Ashes series . That tour also featured Anderson nursing a sore rib after Chris Tremlett inflicted a hairline crack while boxing at the German boot camp, although he had fully recovered by the first Test in Brisbane. The injury revelation helps to explain why a man widely regarded as the most skilful new-ball operator in world cricket claimed a modest 14 wickets at 43.94 runs apiece. While Anderson decided to play on through the pain barrier, other members of the shamed England squad did not see out the tour. Early return from Down Under: Anderson, right, could only watch on as fellow bowler Graeme Swann retired from cricket after the third Ashes Test . Jonathan Trott flew home with a stress-related illness after a torrid working over by the Australian pace attack in the first Test in Brisbane, . Graeme Swann announced his retirement after the third Test and paceman Steven Finn was then sent home to ‘work on technical aspects of his game’. When England were looking for someone to step forward during the final test in Sydney, Boyd Rankin twice left the pitch suffering from back spasms and cramp and sent down only 20 overs in the humiliating 281-run loss. Although Anderson has been reporting for pre-season county duty at Old Trafford, his participation has been restricted to working on a batting technique remodelled by former international colleague Kevin Pietersen over the winter. Clean bowled: Anderson endured a horrific time with the ball and bat during the Ashes tour in Australia . However, it is anticipated he will begin bowling in the indoor nets within a fortnight and will be fit for newly promoted Lancashire’s opening County Championship fixture against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge on April 6. National selector James Whitaker has urged players to show their worth post-Ashes with strong domestic performances ahead of May’s one-day series against Sri Lanka. All England hopefuls will be free to play at the start of the domestic season following a blanket snub from the Indian Premier League. Stake a claim: England selector James Whitaker, right, has urged the team to show domestic form ahead upcoming one-day international matches . Meanwhile, England’s abject effort Down Under was put into a slightly kinder perspective yesterday as South Africa, the world’s No 1 Test playing nation, were also humbled by the rampant Australians. Mitchell Johnson, the scourge of Anderson and the England team, followed up his 37-wicket Ashes haul by returning match figures of 12-127 as the Aussies crushed South Africa by 281 runs in the first Test at Centurion. ‘You never play a perfect game but it felt really good out there,’ said Johnson. Match-winner: Mitchell Johnson claimed match figures 12-127 as Australia beat South Africa in the first Test at Centurion . The South Africans were skittled for 200 on the fourth day as Australia made it six Test wins in a row. Skipper Michael Clarke said: ‘We worked exceptionally hard and, wh e n I look i n my teammates’ eyes at the moment, they are so hungry to continue their success.’ South Africa will be determined to make amends in the second Test, which starts in Port Elizabeth on Thursday. Captain Graeme Smith said: ‘We did not meet expectations and we deserve every bit of abuse that comes our way. It is one of the most disappointing four days we’ve had as a team.’",Anderson broke his rib during the 5-0 whitewash in Australia. Fast bowler has not bowled a ball since returning from Australia.

Born and educated in Eastbourne, seam bowler Hobden made his first-class debut in 2014 and represented Sussex in all formats of the game.
England's lead fast bowling coach Kevin Shine said: ""His potential was huge. He was improving rapidly and I'm certain that he would have played for England.""
England's players are wearing black armbands on day two of the second Test against South Africa in Cape Town on Sunday as a mark of respect for Hobden, who made his final appearance in a one-day match against Essex last August.
He took 23 wickets at an average of 47.30 in 10 County Championship Division One games last season.
A Sussex statement read: ""Matthew was an exciting young cricketer with a big future ahead of him in the game.
""He was a fantastic individual who had progressed through Sussex's youth and academy ranks, having been born locally in Eastbourne.
""Sussex would like to offer their deepest condolences to Matthew's family and friends at this difficult time.""
Angus Porter, chief executive of the Professional Cricketers' Association, said: ""Matt was a young seamer with immense potential.
""The PCA will work closely with Sussex to ensure that their players and coaching staff are supported during this difficult period for the club.""

82327,"A&E departments are so busy that closing more will cost lives, Britain’s top emergency doctor has warned. Dr Clifford Mann said NHS bosses must urgently rethink any plans they have to shut casualty units because it will ‘risk patient safety’ – and take patient care into ‘uncharted territory’. Dr Mann’s comments come amid fears a new wave of A&E closures could sweep the NHS after May’s General Election, despite the unprecedented demand and longer waiting times for emergency treatment. Scroll down for video . Warning: 'Given current demands... any further reduction in their number would be a potential risk to patient safety,' said Dr Clifford Mann (pictured), president of the College of Emergency Medicine . For more than two years, The Mail on Sunday has campaigned against casualty closures, which health bosses and doctors have argued are necessary. But the changes often lead to patients who need urgent treatment travelling further in ambulances or being told to go to a centre staffed by general doctors and nurses, rather than specialised units. Last week, 17 hospitals across England declared ‘major incidents’. Some A&Es were so full that doctors shut their doors on ambulance crews trying to bring in seriously ill patients, paramedics claimed. Dr Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, said part of the reason for this winter’s chaos was that England’s network of A&E units had shrunk in the past decade, even though demand had ballooned. Over the past ten years the number of people attending fully staffed and equipped A&Es has jumped 13 per cent to 14.2 million. That is equivalent to the number of patients treated annually by 25 A&E departments, according to a report by the highly-respected Nuffield Trust think-tank. But instead of building more, 13 A&Es have been closed since 2005. They have been downgraded to ‘urgent care centres’ (UCCs) or ‘minor injury units’ (MIUs), which cannot deal with serious illness or injury. Some are closed at night. Nine of the 13 A&E closures have occurred under the Coalition government. Most recently, two were downgraded in west London last September, and figures now show A&E waits have spiked at nearby Northwick Park Hospital, to which patients are being transferred. England now has 181 A&Es, which health bosses argue is still too many, saying the evidence from cutting smaller stroke, heart attack and trauma units is that centralising emergency services saves lives. Closures: Across England since 2005, 13 A&Es have been 'downgraded' - meaning they were closed and replaced with urgent care centres or minor injury units . But Dr Mann said English A&Es were already ‘incredibly busy’ by international standards – and that widespread closures would worsen the situation. Around a dozen A&Es are thought to be under threat. Dr Mann said: ‘In England we talk about a small emergency department being one that deals with 60,000 patients a year. 'But in the US, Australia and much of Europe that would probably be the largest emergency department in the country.’ The combined effect of increasing demand and the 13 closures means the ‘average’ English A&E now sees 78,500 patients a year – up 13,000, or 20 per cent, since 2004. Dr Mann said: ‘The idea we need to reduce the number of emergency departments and centralise more services, seems to me a fairly brave statement given we are already at one end of the scale, when you compare us internationally. For more than two years The Mail on Sunday has campaigned to save A&Es from closure. We have cut through NHS and ministerial spin to show how shutting departments has led to neighbouring hospitals becoming gridlocked, while towns have been left with inadequate services. Given current demands on our emergency departments, any further reduction would be a potential risk to patient safety.’ A year ago, NHS England unveiled a controversial plan to develop 40 to 70 ‘major emergency centres’. NHS England medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh insisted this would not result in closures, but critics said it would lead to a ‘two-tier’ A&E system in which smaller units suffered. Insiders say the scheme has been put on ice over fears it amounts to ‘political suicide’ – a claim denied by NHS England. But it is believed the plan will be revived after May. Dr Mann said: ‘We have succeeded in creating large emergency departments that give us economies of scale, and concentrate expertise. 'But to go any further is to go into uncharted territory globally.’ Dr Mann stressed he was not against every single downgrade and said ‘rationalisation’ sometimes made sense. But just because centralising stroke, heart attack and trauma units had worked, that did not mean the same approach would benefit the other 95 per cent of A&E patients. Latest weekly statistics show only 79.8 per cent of patients attending England’s 181 A&Es were treated within four hours. The target is 95 per cent. Dr Sarah Pinto-Duschinsky, of NHS England, said: ‘The NHS continues to face unprecedented pressures on frontline services. Flu is at its highest for the last three winters.’ The NHS is under so much strain, medical students are being drafted in to do unpaid hospital shifts, The Mail on Sunday has learnt. Fifth-year students at Leeds University have been asked to ‘undertake extra shift and weekend work’ in local hospitals, according to a leaked email from Professor Paul Stewart, dean of its medical school. Students are not being forced to do the extra shifts, which come on top of their normal placements, but Prof Stewart wrote: ‘We have no doubt you will rise to the occasion.’ Students last night said they were keen to help. But one said: ‘There is no way of dressing this up as anything other than desperation.’ Volunteers will get travel expenses and a ‘subsistence’ allowance.","Dr Clifford Mann said NHS bosses must urgently rethink closure plans.

34485,"By . Martin Robinson . A new ban on cheap alcohol is already failing because high-strength booze is still being sold for less than a bottle of water, experts said today. Since Monday retailers have been unable to sell lager or cider . for less than 50p a can after ministers promised a new minimum pricing regime to end the ‘worst examples of harmful drink’. Shops in Blackpool, Britain's worst town for alcohol-related illnesses and deaths, are selling cans of 7.5 per cent strength cider for 89p, while bottled water on their shelves is the same price or more. Row: Omega strong cider is being sold for 89p a can at Buy Low bargains in Blackpool, right, . Although this 89p price is above the new threshold, shocked health officials have said that David Cameron should already re-think his policy to save lives. An investigation has found that at least . three shops in the seaside resort sold high-strength cans of cider or lager for . less or the same price as a bottle of water. Buy Low Bargains, close to the pier, sells Omega Cider for 89p. Its . manager Sam Meak defended the policy and said: 'They are alcoholics so . they don’t mind if they buy it cheap or whatever, they would buy the . cider if it was £20'. The seaside resort is Britain's poorest and most deprived in terms of income, employment and health problems. Alcohol . is widely blamed and in the past two years 2,914 people were admitted . to hospital with alcohol-related illnesses and 140 died - the highest . figures by population in Britain. The town's Victoria Hospital says it has seen an increase in the number of people being rushed there in alcohol-induced comas or liver failure. NHS Blackpool's alcohol lead Steve Morton said: 'Minimum prices . would have minimal effect on the average person – something like 12p a . week – but it would deter young vulnerable people from buying cheap, . strong alcohol. 'High strength, low cost alcohol tends to be . drunk by people with an alcohol problem and younger people who want to . get as much alcohol as cheaply as possible because they have limited . means. 'Minimum prices need to come in through legislation, but . in the mean time responsible traders should be looking at stopping . selling strong alcohol. The industry needs to take some . responsibility – a dead customer is no customer at all'. Admissions: By population more people are taken Blackpool's Victoria Hospital with alcohol-related illnesses than anywhere else in Britain . Blackpool's public health chief, Dr Arif Rajpura, has called on David Cameron to rethink minimum pricing to save lives. Under his original plans a can of lager would have retailed for £1.56, wine for £4.22 and spirits for £12.60. But the Prime Minister faced strong opposition from within the Cabinet, as ministers warned it could unfairly hit responsible drinkers on lower incomes. So the Prime Minister’s proposal – which would have fixed the cost of a unit of alcohol at 45p – was dumped last summer. Instead cans must be at least 50p each, bottles of wine £2.24 and 750ml bottles of vodka or whisky £10.16. The new system works by banning shops and pubs from selling alcohol at less than the total cost of the duty payable to the Treasury, plus VAT. But experts say it will have a minimal effect. On average, each adult is expected to drink just 0.04 per cent less over the course of the year. So-called ‘hazardous drinkers’ – those who consume more than the recommend safe limits – are predicted to consume just 0.1 per cent less. But Dr Sarah Wollaston, MP for Totnes and campaigner on alcohol pricing, said the effect of the new regime would be ‘minuscule’. ‘I just do not think the evidence is there to support it when you are comparing it with the effect of minimum unit pricing,’ she said.","Shops in Blackpool are selling cans of 7.5% cider for 89p a can. But bottled water is the same price or more, according to experts. Health officials say David Cameron should re-think minimum pricing."

Father-of-one Mr Goodlad, who had remarried just months earlier, was getting the spare tyre out of Mrs Burgess’ car at the time. He was freed by firemen but died soon afterwards from multiple injuries. Mrs Burgess was slightly injured and has suffered psychological trauma since the accident, Leeds Crown Court heard. In sentencing Abernethy to two years and . nine months jail, Judge Scott Wolstenholme said: ‘You were not paying . attention to the road for a considerable time and all along trundling . along in that enormous truck at fifty miles an hour.’ After the case, Mr Goodlad's widow Helen said: ‘The past thirteen months have been agonising. Mounted the verge: Abernethy admitted to dangerous driving after claiming he had something irritating his left eye when his lorry drifted off the road and hit Mr Goodlad's police car (pictured) ‘We all know that Mr Abernethy did . not set out that day with the intention of taking a life but it is . without doubt that he is solely responsible for the death of my husband . Mark.’ Abernethy had started driving that . day just one hour earlier, travelling from his depot in  Middleton, . Manchester, and was on his way to Chesterfield when the collision . happened, the court heard. Jailed: Abernethy arrives at Leeds Crown Court where he was jailed for two years, nine months for the accident . Andrew Dallas, prosecuting, said that there was no suggestion that Abernethy, a father of a teenage daughter, had fallen asleep at the wheel before the late afternoon crash. The driver claimed he had suddenly got a pain in his left eye and had taken his spectacles off to ‘remove a foreign object’. Abernethy said he had woken up that morning feeling a pain in his left eye and a hospital examination did discover an abrasion on the cornea. He failed to notice that his lorry was drifting onto the hard shoulder and said he did not see the police vehicle, which had its flashing warning lights on, until the last second. Other drivers said they saw the lorry slowly drift from motorway onto the hard shoulder and one claimed it then hit the police car ‘at full speed’. Experts said that the lorry could have . travelled for up to 10 seconds for 820ft along the hard shoulder, . drifting partly onto the grass verge. Judge Wolstenholme said he was satisfied . that Abernethy had a problem with his eye but said he had failed to pay . attention to the road ahead. Abernethy will serve half his jail sentence and was banned from driving for three years. Mrs . Goodlad said her husband was her ‘life,’ adding: ‘There are no words to . describe how much I love and miss him. He was the most incredible, . honourable and inspirational person that one could hope to meet. ‘Mark . loved his job and took great pride in his duties; he never overlooked . any opportunity to help people because that’s why he joined the force . and that’s where he found himself that day - at the side of a lady . needing help. ‘It is no exaggeration to say he was one in a billion.’ Hit at 'full speed': Experts said that the lorry could have travelled for up to 10 seconds for 820ft along the hard shoulder before hitting the police car . Agonising: Mr Goodlad, pictured with his son Ben and wife Helen, was an 'honourable and inspirational person,' his wife said . Loved his job: Wife Helen, pictured with Mr Goodlad, said he never overlooked the opportunity to help others 'and that's where he found himself that day'",PC Mark Goodlad was helping a female motorist with a flat tyre when Andrew Abernethy's lorry smashed into his police car. The 45-year-old admitted dangerous driving and was found to be travelling at around 56mph. Mr Goodlad was pinned between his vehicle and Sharon Burgess' Suzuki Swift.
29835,"Two Syrian Orthodox bishops remain missing two days after being kidnapped, with each side in the civil war blaming others for the snatching. The whereabouts of the two prominent clergymen, Greek Orthodox Bishop Paul Yazigi and Syriac Orthodox Bishop John Ibrahim, remain unknown, despite some reports to the contrary, Greek Orthodox Bishop Mousa Khoury told CNN. There have been several kidnappings of Christian clergymen in Syria but the two bishops are the most senior church figures who have been abducted since the beginning of the uprising. The Syrian regime's Ministry of Religious Endowment issued a statement blaming ""this brutal act"" on Chechen mercenaries operating under the mantle of Jabhat al-Nusra and al-Qaeda. The government did not provide evidence to back up the claim. A spokesman for the Free Syrian Army said the government itself could be behind the kidnappings. ""The timing is very suspicious and we believe the Assad regime is behind the kidnapping,"" Louay Almokdad told CNN. Another opposition figure, Rami Abdurrahman of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, elaborated, saying they believe that non-Arab foreign fighters are behind the kidnappings. ""We know that there are foreign fighters who are infiltrated by the regime and the Assad regime is well known for being a ventriloquist of proxy groups that they set up in order to spread chaos, strife and to divide the ranks of the opposition,"" he said. CNN cannot independently confirm the claims by either side. Earlier, there were conflicting reports about the status of the bishops. ""The bishops were supposed to be released by the armed group yesterday evening; then we expected them to head back to their churches. But they didn't, so we are still carrying out all efforts to figure out what happened,"" Abdel Ahad Steifo, a prominent Syriac member of Syria's main opposition group, told CNN. Steifo, who is in charge of the negotiations for the release of the clergymen, says he does not know the identity of the kidnappers. But they are not part of the opposition, he said. In an interview with the Vatican's Fides News Agency, the Chaldean bishop of Aleppo, Antoine Audo, said that at the root of the ""scourge of kidnapping"" is not politics, but ""the pursuit of money on behalf of armed gangs."" Recent incidents of clergymen being kidnapped ended with their release after ransoms of thousands of dollars were paid, he said. On Tuesday, the director of the Holy See press office, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said Pope Francis is closely following the events in Syria. The pope is ""praying for the health and the liberation of the two kidnapped bishops,"" Lombardi said. A number of Muslim clerics have also been killed and kidnapped in Syria, including a top Sunni cleric and longtime supporter of President Bashar al-Assad, Mohammad Said Ramadan al-Bouti, who was killed in a suspicious blast while teaching religious class in Damascus. Rebels and regime officials blamed each other for the assassination of al-Bouti.

18973,"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 05:55 EST, 23 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 08:52 EST, 23 January 2014 . Britain could agree to accept hundreds of refugees from camps in and around Syria, following pressure from the Liberal Democrats. David Cameron is facing calls from Nick Clegg to drop his opposition to the idea of giving sanctuary to some of the 2.3 million people displaced in the bloody conflict. The Lib Dems want Britain to sign up to the United Nations appeal for Western countries to accept 30,000 of those trapped in the region. Help: Britain has so far refused to sign up to the United Nations refugee programme to provide sanctuary to 30,000 people trapped in Syria although Cameron said he was ready to take in some of the most vulnerable . In a sign that Mr Cameron’s position was shifting, he told the Commons yesterday that he was ready to take in some of the most vulnerable refugees from camps in and around Syria. But he stopped short of agreeing to take part in the UN scheme. France has agreed to take 500 refugees and Germany has accepted 1,000 with a promise of admitting another 9,000. The move comes as fears grow that peace talks are close to collapse after a furious clash over President Assad’s future. Amid hostile exchanges in Switzerland, Syria’s government ridiculed demands by opposition leaders and their Western backers including Britain for Assad to stand down, saying it would never happen. With renewed fighting in large parts of Syria, the opposition insisted the country’s leader lost his legitimacy when he crushed a once-peaceful protest movement. But foreign minister Walid al-Moallem said it was terrorists and foreign meddling that had ripped his country apart. Now Mr Clegg and his senior Cabinet colleagues are pushing for Britain to do more to help the millions of people caught up in the conflict. It comes after Ukip leader Nigel Farage called for Britain to start admitting Syrian refugees, arguing ‘there is a responsibility on all of us in the free west’, although he later rowed back after am outcry from Ukip members. A Lib Dem minister told MailOnline: ‘Nigel Farage was absolutely right. Britain should be doing the right thing and providing help to these people who are just desperate.’ Mr Cameron insists Britain is leading the world in delivering aid and was meeting its obligations to asylum seekers, but he has rebuffed calls from Mr Clegg to sign up the United Nations refugee quota scheme. Opinions: David Cameron has set himself against signing up to the UN scheme but Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is urging him to do more to help people in the region . A Lib Dem source told The Times: ‘We . are one of the most open-hearted countries in the world and Nick . believes we have a moral responsibility to help. ‘The . coalition Government has been the most generous in the world when it . comes to helping with the humanitarian crisis in Syria and it would be . self-defeating to allow ourselves to be painted as the least generous. ‘The . Liberal Democrats will continue to make the case around the Cabinet . table. We have yet to gain the agreement of our Conservative colleagues, . but we remain hopeful that we will.’ Mr . Cameron warned that countries which had signed up to the UNHCR scheme - . such as Finland, France and Sweden - should not feel that by taking a . few hundred people they had fulfilled their obligations. A . senior Downing Street source suggested that the kind of ‘hardship . cases’ where the UK could consider taking in refugees might include . children who had been orphaned by the war or who had medical needs or . mental health problems which could not be dealt with in the camps. Britain . is the second largest bilateral donor of aid to help those affected by . the crisis and has taken in more than 1,000 Syrian asylum seekers. Labour leader Ed Miliband is to force a vote in the House of Commons next week on allowing Syrian refugees into Britain . Mr Cameron's official spokesman today declined to give any timetable or estimate of numbers of Syrian refugees facing extreme hardship who might be admitted. The spokesman said: 'What the Government is doing is looking at how we can help the most vulnerable cases of extreme hardship.' But Labour insists that this was not enough to respond to the scale of MPs' concerns, and announced it would stage an opposition day vote next Wednesday calling for Britain to sign up to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees appeal for Western countries to accept 30,000 of those trapped in the region. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'Britain cannot be seen to turn its back on the most vulnerable Syrian refugees who will struggle to survive or cope in the camps, and must support the UN urgently. 'The Government response on the UN programme for vulnerable Syrian refugees is completely inadequate - as Tory and Liberal backbenchers and even the Deputy Prime Minister have now accepted.' Anna Musgrave from the Refugee Council said: 'The UNHCR has long been calling on the UK to offer safe haven to those who will struggle to survive in the region. 'For every person rescued from the region, a resettlement place would be life changing.'","Lib Dems want Britain to sign up to UN appeal to help 30,000 refugees. But David Cameron says he is ready to take in some of the most vulnerable. France, Germany and Sweden have already agreed to take 500 refugees."

The 29-year-old admits he had the chance to speak to a couple of clubs in England but described Celtic as ""the complete package"".
""Of course it's going to be hard,"" Hayes said of breaking into the team.
He could make his competitive Celtic debut in the second qualifying round of the Champions League next month.
The Scottish champions are likely to meet Northern Ireland's Linfield, who have been paired with San Marino's SP La Fiorita in the first round.
""It's going to be a tough,"" Hayes told BBC Scotland. ""There's no easy games in Europe.
""I have a bit of experience playing with Aberdeen there a couple of times where we took our foot off the gas a little bit and got punished. But every game is tough regardless of who we play or where we play.
""Everyone will look forward to playing against Celtic and will raise their game.
""I'm just happy playing in a game where I just finally get a chance to pull this top on. I can't wait to get started.""
Republic of Ireland international Hayes has agreed a three-year deal with Celtic following five years with Aberdeen.
Hayes, who has also played for Leicester and Inverness Caledonian Thistle, began his career at Reading, with Rodgers briefly in charge during his time at the club.
""I was sitting at home waiting all day for the phone call,"" Hayes explained. ""I think it was about six or seven at night when he rang and, honestly, I don't even think I spoke a word for about 30 seconds other than hello and I was sold.
""He's infectious. He's fantastic to work for. It's a long time since I have and I'm looking forward to it but I'd be lying if I didn't say there was a lot of other major factors in wanting to come here. The size of the club, the chance to play out there every week in front of 50-odd thousand, Champions League nights, so many things, when you put together it is the complete package.
""I have full confidence in the manager, I think he can only improve me as a player
""I know I will need to improve and try to hold down a regular place in this team. I'm delighted to finally be here and get the chance to play for this club; it's a challenge I welcome.""
Hayes is also hoping his move to a ""bigger stage"" will aid his international ambitions and revealed that he had spoken to former Celtic manager Martin O'Neill about moving to Parkhead when he was involved with the Republic of Ireland squad recently.

56377,"It is part of a set of prison reforms announced by the government to modernise the country's notorious prisons.
Legal aid centres will be set up in all jails and better health care will also be provided, the new rules say.
There are more than 400,000 inmates in prisons across India, with more than half of them awaiting trial.
Under the new guidelines, jail authorities will let death row convicts see their families before execution.
Last year, the family of a man convicted for plotting bomb attacks in Mumbai in 1993 was denied a meeting with him ahead of his hanging.
Another part of the reforms involves the establishment of new legal aid centres, which will aim to provide guidance to poorer inmates, especially those awaiting trial.
The new guidelines also make it mandatory for jail officers to ensure the safety of female prisoners and care for their children.
Prison staff will be trained to deal with cases of gender and sexual violence.
""This has been drawn from the UN rules for the treatment of female prisoners and non-custodial measures for women offenders adopted by the UN General Assembly,"" a government statement said.","India's jails will be redesigned to allow death row convicts to see their families before hanging, new guidelines say."
22083,"On the subject of Silvio Berlusconi Italians and non-Italians are, to paraphrase George Bernard-Shaw's famous quip about Britain and America, divided by a common political language. We think we share the view that in a political world dominated by mass communications, there is little room for forgiveness about scandals, or other personal failures, or a poor record in office. Yet on those grounds, Berlusconi should have died a political death long ago, rather than coming a very close second in this week's Italian elections. Foreigners, perhaps, will always remain baffled by Berlusconi's success in continuing to attract voters. But Italians, horrified by him though plenty of them are, tend to be a lot less surprised. That is because they think of him in context, rather than in isolation. In Italian politics, the context is all. What this means, and what it meant for Berlusconi's remarkable feat in nearly doubling his share of the vote between his opinion poll ratings in November 2012 and the election itself, can be laid out in the following evidently misleading indicators: . He makes unbelievable promises. In part this is true: one of Berlusconi's traits is his willingness to say one thing today and the opposite tomorrow, to attract attention from different groups or on different occasions, totally without shame. Italians know this, and those who support him tend to see it as an endearing part of his character, part of his desire to entertain and to please. But also it is misleading: the key promise he made during the 2013 election campaign was entirely believable -- that he would cut or even abolish a dreaded property tax, known by its Italian initials as IMU. His record makes him untrustworthy. Yes, on overall economic policy. But not on taxes. He has promised to cut them before, and has delivered on at least some of those promises. The promise to cut IMU was made in an incredibly artful way, as he wrote to voters saying he would pay them back for the tax from his own pocket, which very few will have believed. But that did not matter: it drew attention to the proposal in an eye-catching way, and reinforced the only important point -- that he would cut the tax. Opinion: Italy's election leaves country, and eurozone, on financial high-wire . He is irresponsible. Yes, but so is almost everyone to the cynical Italian political mind. His plan for how to finance this tax cut had as many holes in it as a sieve, but that did not really matter. It would have to be financed by taxes on other people, or cuts in spending on other things. Fine, said his voters: at least this awful tax will go. In offering a relentless focus on that tax, he showed that he was listening to the pain of his voters and taking them seriously, rather than talking down to them like most other parties. His trials and sex scandals make him a national shame. Not really, though at times his behavior has stretched even the Italian tolerance. But the context is important: plenty of people think the justice system works disastrously badly in Italy, so if Berlusconi is caught up in it -- like so many others -- then so what? And his sex scandals are really part of his own marketing plan: he cavorts with scantily clad young women in order to make himself look glamorous, young, entertaining and happy. Moreover, his antics with women act as a distraction from his other weaknesses, like a kind of tranquillizer for those who might otherwise get angry with him. A lot of Italians, especially young women, hate him for this. But enough either don't care or are sympathetic enough to him to mean that this does not harm him fatally in political terms. His opponents are more statesmanlike and responsible. Yes, that is true of Mario Monti, the caretaker prime minister for the past year who then decided to run in the elections with a centrist list of candidates. But it is not particularly true of his big opponents -- including the left-wing Democratic Party, which has its own scandals, its own selfish interests and, during the election campaign, its own evidence of the abuse of political power in the case of Italy's third-largest (and oldest) bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena, whose business was allegedly run and distorted in the interests of local Democratic Party politicians in that area. So the PD (by its Italian initials) is also viewed as selfish by the public, neutralizing Berlusconi's disadvantage on that measure. Since both the PD leader, Pier Luigi Bersani, and Monti are dull, leaden communicators who failed to offer any positive, hopeful message for their voters, the way was opened for Berlusconi. News: Italy seeks way out of political chaos . Only one party in the election really stood for change: the Five Star Movement of Beppe Grillo. This meant that Berlusconi's old-fashioned, tax-cutting message, geared towards preserving his own political power, had plenty of space in which to operate. And although Berlusconi did not stand for change, he was at least cheerful, smiling and entertaining. Politics is now all about personalities, as was shown by the rise of Grillo, but he and Berlusconi are opposites in this regard. It is true that the discrediting of traditional political parties, combined with the preeminence of television, has given personalities a huge advantage in Italian politics, even if neither the PD nor Monti seemed able to grasp this. Personalities and even personal stories breed attention and loyalty, even if from different groups. One of the last Italian politicians to understand and exploit this was, unfortunately, Benito Mussolini. Oh, and did I forget to mention that Berlusconi owns Italy's three main commercial TV channels and its biggest advertising sales agency, and has billions of euros in cash to hand around to supporters and allies? Well, that isn't a misleading indicator. But it is a reason, perhaps too obvious to dwell upon, for Berlusconi's continuing success at the ripe old age of 76.","Italians and non-Italians are divided by a common political language, writes Luca Ferrara. Ferrara: Berlusconi should have died a political death long ago, rather than coming a close second. Ferrara: Italians, horrified by Berlusconi's success, tend to be less surprised by his feat. Ferrara: Berlusconi's promise to cut property tax is believable, but his opponents are more statesmanlike."
60370,"Commissioner Nóirín O'Sullivan denied a decision to refer the matter to GSOC was meant to keep it from the public.
It follows the revelation that large sums of EU funding were put in a bank account in a former officer's name.
The parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has also been investigating the allegations.
For several months, the PAC has been investigating how accounts at the training college in Templemore, County Tipperary, including one designed to cover laundry bills, were used for other purposes including paying restaurant and entertainment bills.
Commissioner O'Sullivan has, in the past, described what happened at Templemore and the evidence of poor financial controls there as a legacy issue.
The money involved in the GSOC investigation came from an EU-funded training programme, and the commissioner told the PAC the account predates her time and that of her predecessor as commissioner, Martin Callinan.
She said the account operated from Dublin over an 11-year period, from 1999 until it was closed in 2010.
She said her understanding was that this was a police account and that the amounts in it ranged from 5,000 euros (£4,000) to just over 90,000 euros (£79,000).
The recent revelations about Templemore come at a difficult time for Ms O'Sullivan, who has faced several opposition calls to stand down over a number of issues, including her handling of police whistle-blowers and the disclosure that police officers had significantly exaggerated the number of breathalyser tests carried out.
With a new taoiseach (prime minister), Leo Varadkar, and a new justice minister, Charlie Flanagan, there is considerable interest in political circles in Dublin about whether the new office holders will show the same support for Commissioner O'Sullivan that their predecessors and the previous cabinet did.",The Irish police commissioner has said she has no intention of revealing the details of a bank account at a training college in County Tipperary.

View  comments . Fighter: Kay Coombes lost her father Peter and brother Paul. Her other brother Steve is one of the missing Cheeki Rafiki yachtsmen . Barely able to sleep and surviving on little more than biscuits, adrenalin and hope, Kay Coombes can’t help but wonder how much more her family – beset by one appalling loss after another – can bear. Her adored father Peter died from a brain aneurism at the age of 49; then in 2008, her brother Paul, 44, died in his sleep after a blood clot travelled to his heart. Two years ago, Kay was diagnosed with breast cancer. Now, just when she thought the worst was behind them, this. Kay’s brother, Steve Warren, 52, is one of four British yachtsmen lost at sea, with hope of finding them alive dwindling by the hour. The US Coastguard said the massive search operation will be called off at 5am today. ‘Right now, it feel as if ours must be the most unlucky family in the world,’ says Kay, 46, a civil servant and divorced mother of one from Bridgwater, Somerset. ‘Our poor mother Margaret is in a terrible state. In the space of six years she’s had to cope with the prospect of losing all three of her children.’ Experienced yachtsman Steve was a crew member on the 40ft yacht Cheeki Rafiki, which was lost just over a week ago after running into difficulties 620 miles east of Massachusetts, while sailing to the UK. The yacht, returning from a regatta in Antigua, began taking on water last Thursday and alerted the authorities at 3.15am local time. At 4.20am, a beacon attached to one of the men’s lifejackets emitted an electronic distress call, followed by another one at 6.57am. Since then there has been no confirmed sighting of the yacht or the men – Steve, his best friend Paul Goslin, 56, James Male, 23, and skipper Andrew Bridge, 22. In the cruellest of ironies, it was the death of his brother and his sister’s battle with cancer that made Steve determined to ‘live for the moment’, seizing the opportunity to join the crew of the Cheeki Rafiki for a ‘trip of a lifetime’. To lose one sibling is devastating enough, but to contemplate losing her other brother has been almost too much for Kay to bear. Tragic: Kay is pictured (centre) with her father Peter who died of a brain aneurism aged just 49. Her brother Paul (left) died at the age of 44 in his sleep from a blood clot in his heart. Steve (right) is now missing at sea . But just as Steve was there for her in times of desperate need, so she summoned up all her reserves to fight for him, rather than give up and accept the worst. She has made it her mission to make sure everything possible has been done to find him. ‘I’m convinced Steve is still alive,’ Kay told me. ‘Even if there’s just a 1 per cent chance of finding him alive, that’s the chance I’m clinging to.’ Kay knows time is running out and with each passing day it becomes harder to hold on to those positive, comforting images of her larger-than-life brother. ‘I have to be realistic. It’s a long . shot, but we need to do everything we can,’ she said. ‘I just don’t want . to think of losing Steve, but if I never see him again, at least I can . know that we did everything in our power to find him.’ Race against time: The US Coast Guard said the search for Steve Warren, 44, will be called off at 5am . The last picture: This is the last image anyone has of the Cheeki Rafiki crew members before they went missing . Kay and her brothers were always close and she and Steve even more so after Paul’s death. She simply cannot imagine life without him. ‘Paul’s death hit the family very hard, because it was so unexpected,’ Kay said. ‘Paul’s death was a wake-up call and completely changed the way Steve looked at life. He was determined to live for the moment and grasp every opportunity.’ Kay added: ‘He was there for me when I needed him and now I have to be there for him. Steve knows I’ll be fighting for him. ‘I’m a fighter. I’ve had breast cancer and I’ve had a double mastectomy. I am a strong woman. ‘Cancer had no chance with me. I’m still here to tell the tale. ‘I need to know that I fought as hard to save Steve’s life too.’","Kay Coombes, 46, lost her father Peter and brother Paul at the age of 49.

36141,"Hong Kong's unpopular chief executive C.Y. Leung, nicknamed ""the wolf"" by detractors, has one Lunar New Year's request for his city's people: . Be more like sheep. ""Last year was no easy ride for Hong Kong,"" said the pro-Beijing leader in an official statement released Wednesday. ""In the coming year, I hope that all people in Hong Kong will take inspiration from the sheep's character and pull together in an accommodating manner to work for Hong Kong's future. ""Sheep are widely seen to be mild and gentle animals living peacefully in groups,"" explained Leung. At first glance, the statement might seem innocent enough -- perhaps even cute. But it's a sharp rebuke to thousands of Hong Kongers who staged a massive protest just three months ago in an unsuccessful call for Leung's resignation. Popularly known as the ""Umbrella Movement,"" demonstrators occupied major roads for over two months and demanded genuine universal suffrage: the right to nominate and elect their next leader. Leung -- who was elected by a small committee dominated by Beijing loyalists -- staunchly resisted the protests. Alan Leong, a legislator who participated in the demonstrations, was horrified by Leung's New Year wish. ""Does he know he has been called a wolf by Hong Kong people?"" he said. ""So is it the wolf speaking, wanting Hong Kong people to behave like sheep, so as to be slaughtered and eaten up by him? ""I think it's crazy, and he is sick."" The leader's lupine nickname is well-known in the city. In late 2013, a protester hurled an IKEA stuffed wolf at Leung, causing the toy to sell out in stores across the city. Although Hong Kong's pro-democracy street occupations have been dispersed, fierce discontent remains among residents who feel the former British colony's values are collapsing under the weight of mainland China's influence. Protesters have repeatedly vowed to organize new forms of civil disobedience this year. When the largest street camps were cleared in December, many demonstrators left banners with a simple message: ""We'll be back.""","Hong Kong's unpopular chief executive C.Y.

He wore specially adapted glasses that inverted images up and down and left and right for over a week and discovered that the human brain could adapt to these new conditions. Irish artists Clearly Connolly have spent years developing a series of hand-crafted aluminium helmets which explore ‘the mysteries of visual perception.’ Here, an individual tries on the horse helmet, which effectively puts their eyes on the side of their head so they can experience the 357° view as if they are a horse . Anne Cleary and Denis Connolly were inspired to make the helmets (an illustration is pictured) after exploring the pioneering experiments by psychologist George Malcolm Stratton in the early twentieth century . The Irish artists' helmets are inspired by the work of George M Stratton. In an experiment conducted in the early to mid 20th century, he wore specially made glasses that turned the world upside down and swapped left and right. He did this for a whole week and slept with a blindfold on to ensure that his vision didn't revert to normal. While the experience was initially unpleasant and disorientating, within a few days, the scientist's brain learned to make sense of the visual information. Astonishingly, after a week, he said that his upside-down world felt relatively normal, indicating his brain adapted relatively easily to the changes. The animal helmets are designed to make wearers question why humans see the world as we do and why our vision is so limited, while animals see their surroundings differently. This is achieved by using carefully set up mirrors inside the helmets to direct the light into a person’s eyeballs. They work in a similar way to a periscope to achieve a desired effect, such as allowing someone to see backwards, or an elevated view, without raising their head. The ‘Meta-Perceptual Helmets’ give humans the opportunity to experience the hyper-stereo vision of the hammerhead shark, so it is as if their eyes are spread much further apart. In 2009, scientists discovered that despite the shark's distinctive head shape, including its protruding eyes, the animal actually see like a human using binocular vision, but with added benefits. The predator also has stereo vision to enjoy a sweeping view of its surroundings, far superior to that of humans. These ‘Meta-Perceptual Helmets’ give humans the opportunity to experience the hyper-stereo vision of the hammerhead shark (pictured). Its wide set eyes allow the shark to see 360 degrees, which enables it to hunt prey such as squid that are able to propel themselves swiftly in any direction . While the hammerhead shark (stock image) has a large blind spot in the centre of its field of vision - in front of its head – it solves this by swinging its head form side-to-side as it swims, so it has a clear view all around itself, including above and below .

Another shiny helmet lets wearers try the backward/forward vision of the chameleon, using metal 'spouts' coming up from the top of the helmet, with mirrors inside. Chameleons arguably have the most distinctive eyes among reptiles, with a scaly cone-shaped lid and small round opening in the middle for a pupil. One of the helmets enables people to see like a chameleon. It is the not the first headset to be developed that allows humans to experience the sensation of seeing in two separate directions at one, as seen in this video . One shiny helmet lets wearers try the backward/forward vision of the chameleon (left) which can focus its eyes independently to look at two objects at the same time, while another helmet gives the the viewpoint of a horse (right), which has a blind spot that humans may find frustrating . The sleek aluminium helmets, which were hand crafted by master coachbuilder Neil McKenzie, hide optics similar to those used in a periscope to 'bend' light and give different effects, such as seeing behind and at an elevated level. Here, the helmets are shown mid way through their production . The lizard can rotate and focus its eyes independently to look at two objects at the same time – something that is difficult and disorientating for wearers of the helmet. This unusual ability gives the lizard a 360-degree view around its body and when it sees prey, it is able to focus both eyes in the same direction to get a clear view and accurately gauge its depth before launching its sticky tongue to catch a fly, for example. A giraffe-inspired helmet gives wearers the feeling of being taller than they are, while another lets them explore the wide peripheral vision of a horse, including its challenging blind spot at the centre of its vision, as if their eyes are on the sides of their head. The position of the horse's eyes affords the animal a wide, circular view of 350-degrees so it can spot predators sneaking up behind it, but just 65-degrees of their vision is binocular. Because its binocular vision - seeing with both eyes - is directed down its nose, the horse has a blind spot in front of its forehead. But it has the largest eyes of all land mammals, so it can easily detect the tiniest of movements . The artists have also designed two helmets inspired by mythology and literature, allowing people to see the world through the eyes of the Cheshire cat from Alice and Wonderland (pictured) and Cyclops . The two helmets based on literature and mythology give people an imaginative experience of seeing in a bizarre way. A 16th century illustration of cyclops is pictures left, and an illustration of the Cheshire Cat, right . ‘The Cheshire Cat Helmet (a sketch is pictured) is so called because of the strange lingering effect of dominating visual information such as a smile or the eyes,’ the artists explained .

85272,"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 19:04 EST, 5 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:04 EST, 5 December 2013 . Waste? Fish oil contains vitamin D . Taking vitamin D supplements in order to ward off illness could be a waste of time, a study shows. Scientists saw little evidence that the pills lowered the risk of cancer, heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s or other diseases. For decades, scientists assumed that the mineral, one of the most popular supplements in Britain, had numerous health benefits. But a review of 462 studies involving more than a million adults has concluded that a lack of vitamin D is not a trigger for many common illnesses. In Britain, the supplements market is worth £700million a year – a growth of 16 per cent in five years – and the most popular pills are multivitamins and fish oils, which contain vitamin D. The main reason scientists thought vitamin D could protect against disease was that patients with cancer, heart disease or Alzheimer’s had very low levels of the nutrient. But the French researchers now suspect that, rather than vitamin D deficiency leading to disease, these illnesses stop the body from producing vitamin D, so sufferers have lower levels. Lead author Professor Philippe Autier, from the International  Prevention Research Institute  in Lyon, France, said: ‘What this  discrepancy suggests is that decreases in vitamin D levels are a marker of deteriorating health. Ageing and inflammatory processes involved in disease occurrence . . . reduce vitamin D concentrations, which would explain why vitamin D deficiency is reported in a wide range of disorders.’ But his study – published in The Lancet – did not cast doubt on the supplement’s effect on the bones. The mineral is known to protect against bone thinning and the bone disorder rickets. Two months ago the chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, called for free vitamins to be given to children after it emerged that a quarter of youngsters are short of vitamin D. Presently it is only available on  prescription to under fives from low income families. In addition, pregnant women and those . who are breastfeeding are advised to take one vitamin D tablet a day – . which they can get on prescription – to ensure their baby’s bones are . healthy. Other academics said more research was needed before vitamin D . was discounted. Professor . Peter Selby, honorary clinical professor of metabolic  bone disease at . Manchester Royal Infirmary, said: ‘One problem with this sort of . systematic review is that it can only examine the studies  which have . been published previously, so it is limited by the level of vitamin D in . subjects in these studies. More investigation: Other academics said further research was needed before vitamin D was discounted . ‘It could very well be that the apparent negative results of this study have been obtained simply because they have not been looking at people with a sufficient degree of vitamin D insufficiency to have any meaningful biological effect.’ Other recent studies have also cast doubt on the curative properties of vitamin D supplements. In one case, scientists found ‘no convincing evidence’ that vitamin D supplements would fend off a cold. Testing was carried out on more than 300 adults in New Zealand over 18 months in 2010 and 2011. Half were given extra vitamin D while the rest took placebo tablets. The vitamin D group caught 3.7 colds per person on average, compared with 3.8 colds per person for the placebo group. In October, a review of previous studies by University of Auckland researchers claimed taking vitamin D supplements did not improve bone mineral density at the hip, spine, forearm or in the body as a whole. Professor Ian Reid, the study’s leader, said: ‘Most healthy adults do not need vitamin D supplements. ‘Our data suggest the targeting of low-dose vitamin D supplements only to individuals who are likely to be deficient could free up substantial resources that could be better used elsewhere in healthcare.’ Professor Reid reviewed 23 studies examining the effects of vitamin D supplements on bone density .",Supplements market is worth £700million a year in Britain.

17314,"When checks are carried out, as many as one in three foreign suspects turns out to have previous convictions abroad.
But 5 live Investigates found while many forces often consulted foreign records, the rate in Cleveland was only about 6% and in Greater Manchester 8%.
The police say improvements are needed but the UK compares well within the EU.
A Home Office spokeswoman said the department would ""use every possible power to stop foreign criminals from coming into this country"".
The spokeswoman insisted that all passengers were checked against police, security and immigration watch lists on arrival and individuals who posed a risk were refused entry.
In October, the government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office (NAO), issued a report called Managing and Removing Foreign National Offenders.
It revealed that last year police had cross-checked the criminal records of only about 30% of people from overseas they arrested.
One of the report's recommendations was that officers should refer more foreign arrests to the Association of Chief Police Officers' Criminal Records Office (Acro), which has access to overseas police files.
""Of those checks that were done last year [on detained foreigners from within the EEA], one in three came back with the result that the arrested foreign national had a serious criminal history,"" said Toby Evans of the NAO.
""If those checks are not done, the key point when foreign nationals can be detained in police stations and removed from the country is being missed.""
New figures obtained by 5 live Investigates show that forces are now requesting more checks.
Some, such as the Metropolitan Police and Hampshire, are now running background checks on all offenders arrested.
That is also the case with Derbyshire Police.
In one instance there, a man accused of assaulting his wife turned out to have been convicted of aggravated murder in his home country of Lithuania.
He is now facing deportation.
6%
of foreign nationals arrested in Cleveland in October had their overseas criminal histories checked by police
8%
The equivalent figure in Greater Manchester
60% is the target for criminal record checks on foreign nationals from within the EU
1 in 3  foreign nationals from within the European Economic Area who were arrested last year were found to have committed serious offences when overseas records were consulted
In Greater Manchester 6,836 foreign nationals were arrested last year, but in October just 8% of foreign nationals detained that month were checked.
In Cleveland, 966 foreign suspects were detained in the year, and in October checks were run on just 6% of those detained that month.
Ch Insp Steve Young of Cleveland Police said: ""The force accepts that vast improvements need to be made and work has already begun to address this issue.
""Our ultimate target is to achieve 100% compliance and it is an absolute priority for me to increase our rate of referrals [to Acro].""
A nationwide target has been set to check at least 60% of arrested foreigners from within the EU.
""This is never going to be one of those situations where you flick a switch and everything happens immediately,"" says Acro chief executive Ian Readhead.
He says better training and an upgrade of IT systems are needed if the target is to be reached.
""Significant improvement is needed in some areas but when compared across the European Union, we're very much at the head of this game,"" said Mr Readhead.
The checks proved vital in many cases, he added.
""Very often we arrest people for minor offences, only to discover that their history is one of committing serious offences in Europe.
""I have no doubt that every chief constable is completely committed to ensure that every foreign national is checked.""

77198,"Vernon Kay looks ahead to Sunday night’s NFC East showdown between the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles are top of the NFC East with four wins from their opening five games this season, but the Giants draw level with their rivals with victory at Lincoln Financial Field on Sunday. When I saw that Channel 4 was covering this game, it brought back real fond memories of what the NFL to me is all about. This is one of the hardest and toughest rivalries that the league has to offer. The Giants and Eagles are pretty much neighbours in terms of states. It is a bitter rivalry that is on par with Liverpool against Manchester United. Over the years the Giants always seemed to come out on top when the likes of Phil Simms and Lawrence Taylor were playing and Bill Parcells was their head coach. The Eagles had Randall Cunningham who, little did we know then, subliminally reinvented the quarterback position if you look at the quarterbacks we have now that can run and throw like Cam Newton and Robert Griffin III. Eli Manning's New York Giants take on the Philadelphia Eagles with a chance to go joint top of the NFC East . Nick Foles has been below-par  with five interceptions so far this season and a banged up offensive line . New England at Buffalo, 6pm . Carolina at Cincinnati, 6pm . Pittsburgh at Cleveland, 6pm . Green Bay at Miami, 6pm . Detroit at Minnesota, 6pm . Denver at New York Jets, 6pm . Baltimore at Tampa Bay, 6pm . Jacksonville at Tennessee, 6pm . San Diego at Oakland, 9.05pm . Washington at Arizona, 9.25pm . Chicago at Atlanta, 9.25pm . Dallas at Seattle, 9.25pm . New York Giants at Philadelphia, 1.30am . At the moment, it is all much of a muchness in the NFC East. The rivalries within the NFC East are epic and this is always an exciting division. It’s a shame the Redskins can’t get up and running, but this division could be won by any one of the Eagles, Cowboys and Giants. I think it’s going to be even-steven all the way and whoever comes third might even have a shot at a Wild Card spot. Eli Manning has been on fire in the last few games for the Giants. He started the season a bit shaky and everyone was talking about him being prone to interceptions. But in the last two games he has scored more than 30 points in each game. His favourite target is his tight end Larry Donnell, which is interesting because the Giants very rarely use their tight ends. But, having said that, Victor Cruz is on form now as well and Odell Beckham Jr is coming into the frame too. Eli has got his haters. He is a bit like Tony Romo in the sense that you either like him or you loathe him. But he’s a proven Super Bowl winner. He has won more Super Bowls than his brother even though Peyton is smashing records. There is only one statistic that really matters in the NFL - how many Super Bowl rings you are wearing. Randall Cunningham during his time as quarterback of the Philadelphia Eagles in 1990 . Andre Williams celebrates a touchdown for the Giants in their win over the Atlanta Falcons . Unfortunately for the Giants, their running back Rashad Jennings is injured for this game. But they have another running back in Andre Williams stepping up. He is a big, powerful running back who can take the hits. On the flip side, the Eagles defense is not the best. They’ve allowed more than 400 yards per game, which is pretty shocking. Their secondary is pretty flaky as well and if Cruz, Donnell and Beckham Jr can get going for the Giants then it is going to be a high-scoring game. With the Eagles offense, everyone talked about Chip Kelly coming into the league with his spread formation and quick tempo. That seems to have slowed down now. Michael Vick has left and Nick Foles is at the helm, but he needs a good game against the Giants. He has an opportunity to really open up this New York secondary, but the problem is that his offensive line is pretty banged up. For this offense to work, he needs time to release the ball. Last year he only had two interceptions but he has had five already this season. I think that comes down to the fact that his offensive line is pretty banged up. Victor Cruz (right) and Rueben Randle (centre) celebrate a touchdown for the Giants . Running back Darren Sproles moved to Philadelphia from the New Orleans Saints . At running back, Darren Sproles is so small and fast and he makes it tough for the big defensive guys up front. LeSean McCoy doesn’t need any introduction because he has proven that he is one of the best running backs in the NFL. It depends on whether the offensive line for the Eagles is up to holding back the Giants defensive line. That is what this game will come down to because they have both got a shaky secondary.

This Sunday night Channel 4 will broadcast live coverage of the New York Giants at the Philadelphia Eagles.",The New York Giants take on the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC East.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have hired a Spanish supernanny for Prince George, it has been claimed. Prince William and Kate have chosen a nanny said to be in her mid-thirties who has worked for high-society families for two decades. The news comes as photos emerged this weekend of the eight-month-old prince with a childminder in Hyde Park, as his parents holiday in the Maldives. A friend of the unnamed nanny told Hello! magazine: 'She has worked with other prominent high-society families in the past. 'It was from there that the Cambridges heard of her and hired her. 'She is not married and doesn't have a boyfriend as her life is totally dedicated to the family she is working with. 'She is known for being totally professional - married to the job.' William and Kate have made clear they intend to be hands-on parents. They have often enlisted the help of Kate's mother Carole Middleton, as well as occassionally employing William's former nanny Jessie Webb. However, with their upcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand signalling the start of more frequent public engagements, sources claim the royal couple is eager to secure an aide. The pair faced a barrage of criticism when they flew off on their second honeymoon last week. The couple have flown to an exclusive resort on the Maldives, leaving their baby with Carole and Michael Middleton – plus his own security detail – at their Berkshire mansion. But the decision sparked a storm on social networking sites Mumsnet and Twitter. Critics said they were wrong to leave the young Prince for so long, while others were concerned about the extravagance of their stay only a few weeks after the whole family, including George, went to Mustique. William and Kate always said they want to be hands-on parents but their list of duties is growing . Kate's mother Carole and William's former nanny Jessie Webb have previously helped out with childminding . The couple arrived at Cheval Blanc Randheli on Noonu Atoll, on Thursday for a week-long break. Packages there, including flights, can cost £6,799 a person. Some people questioned how Prince William, already condemned for boar hunting in Spain last month, was able to take time off from his ten-week agriculture management course at Cambridge University. However, a number of other commenters said the move may suggest they have already found a nanny to care for him while they are gone. Clarence House declined to comment.",News comes as photos emerge of Prince George with childminder in Hyde Park. Unnamed nanny said to be in her mid-thirties and has worked for two decades.

64937,"Craig Mackey told new recruits at the police training college Hendon it had also been been an awful week ""for the policing family"".
But he said they would ""never be alone"" and that their city was proud of them.
It comes two days after PC Keith Palmer was killed preventing Khalid Masood from entering Parliament.
Masood, 52, drove his car onto the pavement and into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before crashing the vehicle into railings and running into the grounds of Parliament.
On Friday acting commissioner Mackey said: ""We are mourning the loss of a brave officer, PC Keith Palmer, who died protecting Parliament and our democracy.
""At moments like this, rare though they are, it is natural to be afraid and to despair at the inhuman violence we have seen.
""But it is at moments like these that you truly appreciate the strength of the policing family.""
Fifty people were injured in Wednesday's attack, with 31 receiving hospital treatment.
Two people remain in a critical condition, and one has life-threatening injuries.
Acting commissioner Mackey told the new recruits: ""As police officers, we have a special bond with the public, as their protectors and guardians. It is a bond that grows stronger in adversity.
""We have seen the gratitude of this city to its police service manifested this week with kind words and gifts. They're proud of you and your colleagues. As am I.""
On Thursday evening acting commissioner Mackey joined Home Secretary Amber Rudd, London Mayor Sadiq Khan and hundreds of people at a candlelit vigil in Trafalgar Square to remember those who lost their lives as a result of Wednesday's attack.
Candles were laid on the ground and on the steps leading to the National Gallery, then lit in memory of those who died.
Earlier, Army veteran Mike Crofts, who witnessed the attack and rushed to help PC Palmer, told BBC Breakfast it was his military training that made him react.
""Unfortunately despite our best efforts we were unable to save him.
""He was at the time surrounded by a whole host of colleagues who really loved him. We held his hand through the experience, talked to him throughout.""who lost their lives.","The acting commissioner of police has said it was ""natural to be afraid and despair"" at the ""inhuman violence"" in London."

23206,"By . Steve Nolan and Hayley O'keeffe . PUBLISHED: . 12:37 EST, 6 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:22 EST, 6 November 2013 . A DJ who murdered his girlfriend's 'outgoing, chatty' three-year-old daughter when he was supposed to be looking after her was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 20 years today. Delroy Catwell attacked Lylah Aaron because he was jealous of the attention she was receiving from her mother. When Lylah died she was found to have bruises on her body from being punched, kicked and slapped, and had three broken ribs. Catwell, 31 was told by Mrs Justice Nicola Davies: 'It is difficult to conceive of a greater abuse of trust than that which you perpetrated in killing this vulnerable and defenceless young girl.' He had denied murdering Lylah, but was found guilty by a jury at Sheffield Crown Court yesterday. Jailed: Delroy Catwell (left) was sentenced to at least 20 years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend's three-year-old daughter Lylah Aaron (right) Ms Chibanda, who found it too upsetting to attend much of the trial, broke down in tears as the verdict was read out. The court had heard from medical experts that the force used to break Lylah's ribs was similar to that seen in a car crash or a fall from a tall building. As well as a 'sustained and forceful attack' on Lylah hours before she died, the jury was told that Catwell also slammed the tot’s head . against a bedroom wall damaging the plaster three weeks previously - . claiming he hit the wall because he was trying to kill a spider. Seven months before she died, Lylah was found with a bruised neck which . Catwell said was caused when she banged her head on a sink. Paramedics were called on February 8 when Ms Chibanda found Lylah was not . breathing when she returned from work at Derby Royal Infirmary. She asked . Catwell to help but he did not respond. She said: 'He looked like he . was in shock. He was just frozen.' Paramedics . discovered Lylah’s body was rigid and attempted resuscitation. She was . rushed to Sheffield Children’s Hosptal but later died. Public shock: Floral tributes were left outside the toddler's Sheffield home after the murder in February . Prosecutor Bryan Cox QC said: 'There . were numerous bruises over her body. 'There was . substantial bruising to her head and fractures to her ribs. 'The injuries . indicated she had been subject to a sustained and forceful assault that . had occurred within hours of her admission to hospital.' Mr Cox had told the court: 'The couple’s relationship was generally good but sometimes he would complain he felt sidelined and she gave too much to Lylah.' 'This murder was a forceful and . sustained attack on a defenceless three-year-old girl.' Det Supt David Barraclough . Catwell, an unemployed DJ, told police the girl was full of energy and he found it hard to deal with her demands while trainee nurse Miss Chibanda said 'he at times mentioned that I perhaps smothered her.' Lylah’s mother had gone to work on the day her daughter died but Catwell failed to take Lylah to nursery where staff described her as 'bright' and a 'confident, bubbly little girl'. He claimed the girl was tired and had been ill for a few days so after watching cartoons he put her to bed that afternoon. He told police: 'I have never hit Lylah. I didn’t cause any injuries whatsoever.' Experts said he must have inflicted the fatal injuries before Miss Chibanda returned from work at about 4.30pm. Hunt for clues: A forensics officer enters the Sheffield home of Lylah Aaron. Scientific evidence suggests that her head was banged off a wall in the main bedroom of the house . A pathologist reported that the bruises to Lylah’s head were 'typical of non-accidental injuries' and bruising in and behind the left ear 'suggested impact from a hard object with a straight linear surface.' He went on: 'Other bruises could have been caused by kicks, slaps or punches.' All the bruises had been caused within 24 hours of her death. Medical experts found scar tissue on the brain indicating a three-week-old injury and four rib fractures, one of which was about three weeks old. The other three fresh breaks had been caused by 'squeezing or compression'. The medics concluded Lylah died from repeated impacts causing fatal bleeding to the brain. The court was told that Catwell had a previous conviction for sexual assault against a 13-year-old girl in August, 2005 . Andrew Robertson QC, defending, said the attack on Lylah was not pre-meditated and although he admitted there were as number of impacts the court could 'never be sure in this case that there was an intention to kill.' Judge Justice Nicola Davies, heard pre-sentence submissions from both barristers who agreed that Catwell will receive a life sentence with a minimum term to be fixed by the judge. Both lawyers also agreed the judge's starting point for fixing the minimum term was 15 years but she could increase this by taking into account aggravating factors. Mr Cox said these factors should include the vulnerability of the victim, the abuse of a position of trust, the previous violence towards Lylah, the fact he tried to blame his partner for the murder and his previous conviction. Life sentence: Delroy Catwell, who murdered his girlfriend's toddler daughter, was told be will serve a minimum of 20 years in prison by a judge at Sheffield Crown Court today . After the verdict investigating officer . Det Supt David Barraclough said: 'This murder was a forceful and . sustained attack on a defenceless three-year-old girl. 'It was both . deliberate and violent and perpetrated by Catwell the man who should . have been caring for her. 'It is clear his vicious acts left Lylah with . injuries that later were to prove fatal.'","Delroy Catwell attacked Lylah Aaron because he was jealous of her attention.

87898,"It fell again today - a move some are interpreting as a second devaluation.
However, the system China has put in place means the yuan could, in theory, keep on devaluing.
As long as it decides it wants it to.
For the first time the central bank is allowing the market to play a part in setting the exchange rate.
The central bank, the People's Bank of China, said in a statement: ""Since China's trade in goods continues to post relatively large surpluses, the yuan's real effective exchange rate is still relatively strong versus various global currencies, and is deviating from market expectations.
""Therefore, it is necessary to further improve the yuan's midpoint pricing to meet the needs of the market.""
Before Monday the official rate for the yuan or renminbi was arbitrarily fixed each day by the bank.
Since then bank has said it will still fix the rate, but will base it on the level it reached in the market on the previous day.
So in theory the market will dictate the rate at which the yuan is traded at at the beginning of each day.
The devaluations of the last two days have therefore been in response to the downward pressure of the market on the currency, with Wednesday's opening rate reflecting Tuesday's close.
However, in reality the central bank will intervene in the market to keep some control over the exchange rate.
On Wednesday the yuan fell almost 2% during the day as investors aggressively sold it off.
But it was then yanked back by the central bank buying equally aggressively just before the close. So the new trading level on Thursday will be only 0.8% lower than the start of the previous day's trade.
Jonathan Fenby, managing director of the China team at Trusted Sources believes that the central bank really is moving towards liberalisation.
He said: ""What you've done is gone to market fixing for the currency. It's still controlled. There's still a 2% band either side of the fixing. But this is a move towards market liberalisation.""
He says that there is a genuine desire among the reformers in the government to liberalise the exchange rate as well as to stimulate the economy through a devaluation.
He said: ""The reformers in China, the modernisers, want the economy, everything, including the currency to be much more affected by, and set by, market forces rather than by the authorisation of a one party state.""",China's central bank has said it will continue to fix the exchange rate for the yuan on Thursday.

84943,"ODI vice-captain Buttler was dropped for the third Test in Sharjah after scoring 156 runs in his past 12 innings at an average of 13.
""I am confident he can recapture his form,"" Morgan told the BBC.
The first ODI of the four-match series takes place on Wednesday in Abu Dhabi.
Pakistan won the three-Test series 2-0.
Buttler, who averages 32.60 in 61 ODIs, made 38 off 37 balls in England's 169-run warm-up victory over Hong Kong on Sunday.
""In the last four years, he's been outstanding and has shown glimpses of world-class ability,"" said Morgan.
""He plays a formidable role within our squad, he holds some fantastic records, and he's keen to come out and express himself in this series.""
With Test opening bowlers James Anderson and Stuart Broad not in the one-day squad and Mark Wood and Steven Finn ruled out with injury, the series will test the depth of England's seam options.
Reece Topley, who has only one ODI cap, is among the bowlers in the squad, along with fellow left-armer David Willey, Liam Plunkett, Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes.
""Not having the senior of our bowlers here presents opportunities for our younger guys,"" Morgan said.
""We have two left-armers in our squad and Liam Plunkett and Chris Jordan, who have different aspects to their game that might come into use out here, where the ball doesn't move that much off the straight and you have to come up with different ideas.""
Willey says he and other players who did not play in the Test series could be ""undercooked"" after having only one warm-up game to adjust to the conditions in the United Arab Emirates.
The Yorkshire all-rounder clamed 4-43 from 10 overs against Hong Kong, but Topley and Woakes only bowled seven apiece.
Plunkett and Jordan, who were unused members of the Test squad, did not play in the warm-up match.
""We could have probably done with a couple of extra days out here, just to get adjusted to the heat, coming from the cold back in England,"" Willey said.
""A few extra days in the warm to bowl would have been handy.""
Morgan will be playing his first international match since being hit on the head by a Mitchell Starc bouncer in the fifth ODI against Australia at Old Trafford in September.
The 29-year-old said: ""It was probably about 10 days before I was completely right.
""I had feelings of off-balance, grogginess, a little bit of blurred vision. I was worried - it was a weird feeling that I've never had before.
""I've worked on the short ball quite a lot so hopefully it will put me in good stead for this series.""
Pakistan batsman Shoaib Malik, who retired from Test cricket despite making a double century in the first Test and claiming Test-best figures in the third, could play after returning to form in Pakistan's warm-up match.
The all-rounder hit 63 from 49 balls in the win over Nepal, while captain Azhar Ali made a run-a-ball 73 and 21-year-old batsman Babar Azam, who has played only three ODIs, 43 off 29 balls.

69510,"By . Mia De Graaf . The private firm that decides whether benefit claimants are fit for work has a backlog of more than 700,000 people, it has emerged. Atos has been berated by ministers as the number of people awaiting assessment has more than trebled to 712,000 in four years. The figures are the latest in a catalogue of failures by the firm, which has been forced to end its Government contract ahead of schedule. Not satisfied: Work and Pensions Minister Mike Penning told MPs at the department's select committee yesterday that Atos Healthcare is incapable of carrying out the work capability assessments . Blasting the company, Work and Pensions Minister Mike Penning said: 'I don't think Atos had the capacity to do what was asked.' A Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) spokesman addressing the Work and Pensions Select Committee added that Atos 'couldn't deliver the quality at the capacity we want'. The DWP said the total backlog stood at 712,000 people - 394,000 new claimants and 234,000 awaiting reassessments to decide whether they are still entitled to the benefit. A further 84,000 are people still on incapacity benefit who have not yet been moved over to ESA. Mr Penning admitted the government failed . to meet its own deadline of moving these people onto the new benefit by . April, and they are still awaiting assessment. Atos Healthcare has regularly come under fire over the assessments – which are used to gauge eligibility for employment and support allowance and incapacity benefit – amid claims people are being wrongly recommended for work or put through stressful medical interviews. One third of its decisions have been overturned on appeal and the firm has become a lightning rod for Left-wing critics of the Government’s welfare reforms. Backlog: With Atos in charge, a backlog of 712,000 claimants has built up - three times more than in 2010 . The company revealed it has been in discussions with officials for ‘several months’ about ending its work capability assessment contract, which was due to run until August 2015. But speaking at the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee, representatives of the firm claim they have been 'vilified' by the Government despite doing what was asked of them. Senior vice president Lisa Coleman said Atos had become a 'lightning rod' for public anger and it was 'massively over-simplistic' to think a change of provider would change that. Mr Penning said a decision in March to end Atos's contract early was based on the fact he had lost faith in the firm. He said a new contractor - expected to be appointed in early 2015 - would not be chosen on cost alone but on its ability to carry out the assessments in a timely and proper fashion. The DWP said: 'Incapacity Benefit . reassessment has resulted in over 700,000 people looking for, or making . steps to return to work - it is crucial that we continue this important . process to ensure that people are not written off and we get a fair deal . for the taxpayer.'","Number of people awaiting assessment has more than trebled to 712,000. 394,000 new claimants and 234,000 awaiting reassessments to decide whether they are still entitled to the benefit.

He said: ‘People say “why did he have a girlfriend last year?”. Well, because I had a girlfriend last year. ‘And it wasn’t until spring this year, it came upon me. I didn’t expect it and it happened. Everything kind of clicked, everything went right.’ When Ross asked if he was surprised by his feelings, Daley replied: ‘It was the fact I was falling for a guy and it happened so quickly.’ Daley said he did not want to label himself as gay or bisexual, adding: ‘To be honest, everything is all pretty new and I don’t see any point in putting a label on it.’ Last night, friends said Daley was . dating a female friend as recently as March – but broke up with her when . he met Black.

Daley told Ross his boyfriend was his first real love, saying: ‘I can’t get him out of my head all the time’. Black won an Academy Award in 2008 for best original screenplay for his film Milk, starring Sean Penn, which is based on the life of gay rights activist and politician Harvey Milk. He co-founded the American Foundation for Equal Rights and has been repeatedly listed in OUT Magazine’s ‘50 Most Powerful LGBT persons’. Last weekend Black attended the Side By Side Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay, and Transgender Film Festival in St. Petersburg, Russia. It was really love at first sight. I've never felt anything like it before. I hadn't even talked to him and I was like, wow. I didn't know what to do . Tom Daley . But his reputation as a safe-sex advocate was marred in 2009 when gossip columnist Perez Hilton published explicit photographs of Black having unprotected sex. The screenwriter later issued an apology. Black answered the door of his £1million Los Angeles home yesterday, but did not comment when asked about his relationship with Daley. The gated English Tudor-style four-bedroom house is set just off Sunset Boulevard. Daley has made a number of secret visits to California and the pair were pictured drinking coffee together in Los Angeles in October. The coffee shop is within walking distance of Black’s home. Yesterday Black wrote on his Facebook profile: ‘Slept all day today after my trip to Russia. Did I miss anything?’ Friends then appeared to confirm rumours he was in a relationship with Daley by posting swimming puns in response to the message. Jayden Parker O’Neal wrote: ‘Let me take a dive into this. Nope, everything is just swimming along. Marc Wheeler said: ‘Oh, you know, just a little something about some Olympic athlete dating some equally gorgeous and wonderful man, but other than that, no.’ Together: Tom was rumoured to be dating US diver Kassidy Cook last year . While Daley never mentioned his name, the young diver seemed more than happy to talk about his boyfriend on Ross’s show, which had been brought forward to coincide with his announcement. He said he was instantly attracted to him, telling Ross: ‘It really was love at first sight. I’ve never felt anything like it before. I hadn’t even talked to him and I was like okay, wow, I didn’t know what to do.’ He described how he walked over to the man and typed his phone number into his mobile. He added: ‘I have never had it before where I love someone and they love me just as much as I love them. I am used to – believe it or not – rejection when it comes to girls and dating. Honestly, seriously. ‘I have never been in a position before where I have felt so happy. I thought I felt feelings like it before but this way surpasses all of it. Nothing compares.’ Dining out: Tom Daley leaving Itsumo Japanese Restaurant in London, after his confession video was made public . Daley said his boyfriend supported his decision to announce he was in a gay relationship, which he declared via a YouTube video message on Monday. He also said his partner had encouraged him to keep diving when he wanted to quit earlier this year. He said: ‘He just gave that extra motivation and made me think, yeah, and he just made me work so hard. He’s just exactly what I need.’ Black’s agent and publicist did not return calls or emails about Daley. When asked about Black, Daley’s spokesman said he would ‘not be making any comments today’. Teammates: The British Olympic divers relaxes with Tonia Couch beach in Fort Lauderdale, Florida .","Tom Daley, 19, was dating Dustin Lance Black, 39, in March. The pair were spotted together in Los Angeles. Black is believed to be an Oscar-winning gay activist 20 years his senior."
21756,"Following the July Budget, banks will have to pay an 8% tax charge on profits of more than Â£25m, starting next year.
At the same time, the bank levy, which affects the larger banks, will be gradually reduced.
But the small banks argue that the new tax will harm their ability to lend money, and they want it reformed.
""The only way to address the too-big-to-fail problem is to foster the development of smaller banks,"" said Paul Lynam, the chief executive of Secure Trust Bank, one of the smaller banks involved.
Speaking on Radio 4, he argued that the bigger banks have other unfair advantages.
""The amount of capital that the smaller banks are required to hold, relative to the larger banks, is disproportionately punitive,"" he said.
However Chancellor George Osborne has previously argued that the new 8% surcharge is fair, and will increase competition.
The bank levy, which is calculated according to the size of bank's balance sheets, will be reduced in January from 0.21% to 0.18%.
It will subsequently be cut further.
Large banks like HSBC and Standard Chartered had complained that they were penalised, because the levy applies to operations abroad, as well as in the UK.
Because of that, HSBC had threatened to move its headquarters outside the UK.
In July the chancellor announced that in six years' time the levy would only apply to a bank's UK operations.","Smaller banks are being forced to pay a new tax on their profits, despite the chancellor's plans to cut the tax."

Batzel told the website 'There’s a slight possibility the ice-ball fell from an airplane. It’s not a common occurrence but it does happen from time to time. It’s very likely that many arriving airplanes were operating in that vicinity Tuesday.' Batzel also said 'Some airplanes use potable water to flush the lavatory toilets. Normally the flushed waste is collected in a storage tank but if the tank was leaking, ice could have built up on the outside of the plane and eventually broke free.'","The ice dropped into John Connors' apartment around 12pm his cat Oscar was inside, but was not injured during the incident.

5146,"Teresita Sison, 58, of Ladbroke Grove, died when the tree fell as she made her way to work in Kensington Road in October 2014.
The tree had fallen across the road in high winds as the UK was hit by the remnants of Hurricane Gonzalo.
Police prioritised controlling traffic at the time, the inquest heard.
PC Matt Durrant, who was called to the scene on the morning of 21 October 2014, told the Royal Courts of Justice he thought the tree was ""in a fixed and stable position"" resting on railings.
He said pedestrian safety was considered but, as the pavement was blocked, the five officers present worked to control the flow of traffic on the road rather than taping off the path.
However, CCTV showed several pedestrians walking through the natural archway formed by the tree before it fell  further, killing Mrs Sison.
Lukas Rootman, representing the owner of the land where the tree was growing opposite Hyde Park Barracks, suggested PC Durrant could have seen that pedestrians were walking under the tree.
Mr Rootman said the officers had ""missed the opportunity to change what you were doing as your attention was elsewhere.""
Coroner Shirley Radcliffe previously told the jury Mrs Sison was ""killed by the weight of falling masonry"" as she walked under the tree at 11:35 BST.
The inquest is expected to last until Wednesday.","A police officer who was called to a tree that fell on to a road in London's Hyde Park has told an inquest he thought the tree was ""in a fixed and stable position""."
95183,"The new deployment will bring to 300 the number of US special forces soldiers in Syria.
Speaking in Hannover, Germany, Mr Obama said the troops would not lead the fight but would provide training.
He has repeatedly ruled out sending in American ground forces.
""Make no mistake,"" he said. ""These terrorists will learn the same lessons that others before them have, which is: your hatred is no match for our nations, united in defence of our way of life.""
Earlier, US Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes said IS had been pushed out of some strongholds in northern and eastern Syria.
""We believe the commitment of additional US special forces can play a critical role,"" he added.
The goal, officials said earlier, was to encourage more Sunni Arabs to join Kurdish fighters in north-east Syria.
While in Hannover, President Obama is discussing Syria and other foreign policy issues with leaders of the UK, Germany, France and Italy.
On Sunday, Mr Obama said he was ""deeply concerned"" about a surge in violence in Syria, with the opposition accusing the government of violating a truce brokered by the US and Russia.
Mr Obama has resisted calls to send combat troops into Syria, where a five-year-old conflict has killed more than 250,000 people and displaced some 11 million others.
Of those, four million have fled abroad, including growing numbers who are making the dangerous journey to Europe.
Last October, the US deployed up to 50 ""special operators"" to northern Syria to help train and coordinate anti-IS forces there. Their focus seems to be on trying to get more Syrian Arab forces into the field as part of a loose alliance of Arab, Kurdish and other fighters.
Some 250 more troops, many of them special forces, will build upon and expand this work. The US sees this as reinforcing success. IS has suffered several setbacks in both Iraq and Syria and it is under concerted air and cyber attack, intended not just to push its forces back but to destroy its sources of revenue - its oil and physical stocks of money.
Bolstering Arab forces also helps to placate the Turks, alarmed by the military success of Kurdish fighters in Syria.
The crisis has put pressure on EU states which are  struggling to halt a massive influx of migrants and refugees.
Germany received close to 477,000 asylum applications last year as almost 1.1m migrants arrived. A further 181,405 asylum applications have been made so far this year.
Speaking alongside Mr Obama on Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged warring parties to set up safe zones in Syria where refugees would be protected within the country.
She expressed hope that such a plan might eventually be agreed at peace talks taking place in Geneva.
Mr Obama, however, said it would be ""very difficult"" for those zones to work without a large military commitment.
IS has lost parts of the territory it once controlled in Syria. Most recently, they were pushed back by Russian-backed Syrian forces from the strategic city of Palmyra.
The group has also had significant setbacks in Iraq, including the loss of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province.
The US has led a coalition against the militant group in both Syria and Iraq.
Also in his speech in Hannover, President Obama repeated calls for Europe to remain united, two months ahead of a vote in the UK over whether to leave the EU.
""If a unified, peaceful, liberal, pluralistic, free-market Europe begins to doubt itself... then we can't expect the progress that is just now taking hold in many places around the world will continue,"" he said. ""Instead, we will be empowering those who argue that democracy can't work.""",US President Barack Obama has announced plans to send more troops to fight Islamic State (IS) militants in northern Syria.
16634,"By . Dan Bloom . A cash-strapped council has been criticised for handing a rugby team at least £750 for a weekend jaunt to the south of France. It is thought officials in Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, have been offering the £50-a-head subsidy for several years despite savage budget cuts. The biennial tour sees players take a 24-hour bus ride to their twin town of Bron, where they enjoy 'festivities' before a match against Bron's rugby club. Controversial: The money was paid to support the town of Cumberland, North Lanarkshire (file photo) The grants were exposed this week and came despite North Lanarkshire Council axing 700 staff over three years to meet £62million of budget cuts. The total handed to the club is likely to be higher than £750 (one grant per player), as council officials were unable to say what amounts were given out in previous years. Rugby club president Jim Cochrane insisted the cash, which is for travel expenses only, showed the council's commitment to Cumbernauld. But the handouts were criticised by an Scottish National Party councillor and a taxpayers' campaign group. Eben Wilson, of Taxpayer-Scotland, said: 'Rugby clubs are private organisations and should survive or fail on their own efforts. Twin town: The bus trip every two years is to Bron (pictured), near Lyon in the south of France . 'It's not a good idea to start subsidising them, because there is no end to the number of people who might want support. 'Taxpayers want their taxes spent on public services, not private trips.' North Lanarkshire councillor Tommy Cochrane, from the SNP, added: 'We need to find exactly where this money is being sourced from. 'All council spending should be focused locally rather than being taken out of the region. 'If the council is having to make cuts, then we should be very careful where we're spending money.' Cumbernauld RFC began making the 1,000-mile in 1983 and the tours have been a tradition since then. The Scottish and French clubs alternate who hosts the matches, playing an away match in one year and a home match in the next. Picturesque: A country park in Cumbernauld. The council said the cash was to help cover travel expenses . The club's president Jim Cochrane insisted the council's support showed its commitment to the town. 'The council have been supporting us for years,' he said. 'I'll be the first to admit that I was surprised, in these days of cuts, that they were still able to offer the money. 'It is absolutely great of them, and shows that they haven't lost sight of the strong links between two sporting organisations and value what the club are doing in maintaining these links.' A council spokesperson added: 'Cumbernauld has a long standing twinning agreement with Bron and we are proud of the education, business and sporting links. 'Since 1983 annual exchange visits have taken place between the Cumbernauld and Bron Rugby clubs. 'The council is happy to support this and offers £50 to each participant from Cumbernauld to assist with their travelling expenses.'","Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, offered £50-a-head subsidy for several years.

35683,"Medics made the call after conducting scans on the two-time world champion.
He will be replaced by McLaren reserve driver Stoffel Vandoorne, who will be making his F1 debut in Bahrain.
A ""disappointed"" Alonso says there was ""a risk the fracture could affect the lung"" and he ""respects the decision"".
In Thursday's news conference in Bahrain, the 34-year-old revealed he suffered a pneumothorax  - a partially collapsed lung - as a result of the accident in Melbourne but this had now healed.
He said it was ""not 100%"" that he will be able to race in China in two weeks and he will be tested again in the next eight to 10 days after which governing body the FIA will evaluate his condition.
Alonso added: ""I am already recovered from the pneumothorax but the rib is too fresh and it could be a potential problem.
""I have no respiratory problems. It is a small risk, but I understand they want no risk. It is just a question of time - it should be OK in the next 10 days but there is no guarantee.""
Alonso will stay in Bahrain for the race weekend to help Vandoorne and the team.
The FIA said Alonso's chest scans ""showed insufficient resolution of the signs to allow him to compete"".
It is the second time in just over a year that Alonso has been forced to miss a grand prix on medical grounds - he sat out the 2015 season-opener in Australia following a heavy crash in pre-season testing.
The Spaniard spent 90 minutes with FIA doctors after arriving in Bahrain on Thursday, undergoing the standard checks for any driver who has suffered a heavy crash.
Alonso's car rolled and landed upside down after he hit the back of Haas driver Esteban Gutierrez's car in Melbourne on 20 March.
His McLaren-Honda team have had to prepare a new chassis and engine for this race as a result of the extensive damage incurred in the accident.
Vandoorne, a 24-year-old Belgian, is the reigning GP2 champion - the level below F1 - and one of the most highly regarded drivers not to have a regular F1 drive.
He will fly overnight to Bahrain from Japan, where he has been testing the car he races in their Super Formula series.
Vandoorne tweeted: ""About to board for Bahrain, a bit earlier than expected but so much looking forward to it. Will do my very best for the team.""
He is a possibility to replace Britain's Jenson Button as Alonso's team-mate in 2017 and racing this weekend provides him an opportunity to showcase his abilities.
Former McLaren driver Kevin Magnussen, now racing for Renault, said he expected Vandoorne to be able to compete with Button.
""I think he can do that - he's well good enough to be in F1,"" said Magnussen, who beat Vandoorne to the 2013 Formula Renault title and was Button's team-mate in 2014. ""So he will have a good race.""",Fernando Alonso has been forced to miss the Chinese Grand Prix due to a fractured lung.

City had looked dead and buried inside the first 15 minutes as Bayern raced into a 2-0 lead. Thomas Muller opened the scoring after five minutes sliding home a low left-foot shot past City keeper Joe Hart. Seven minutes later, Mario Gotze doubled the lead capitalizing on a dithering City defense to fire home from six yards following a corner kick. But the tide started to turn against a rampant Bayern just before the half-hour mark as David Silva slid in to score after James Milner had headed the ball into the six-yard area. The England international was involved again for City's equalizer when he was brought down by Dante in the penalty area in the 59th minute. The resulting spot kick was tucked away without fuss by Aleksander Kolarov who sent keeper Manuel Neuer the wrong way. Three minutes later, Milner capped a memorable night for City and himself with a low, side-foot drive past the despairing hands of Neuer. ""To go two down against that sort of side and come back and win shows how much character there is in the dressing room,"" Milner said afterwards. ""To come here and put in that performance gives us a lot of belief for the next round."" City's win takes them level on 15 points with Bayern but the German champions finish first on account of their superior goal difference. Nevertheless, City and manager Manuel Pellegrini can take massive credit for the win.

98352,"A North Korean believed to be a runaway soldier killed four Chinese citizens during a robbery after he crossed the border into China in search of food, media reports said Monday. The young North Korean soldier crossed the border in late December and stole money and food at a house before killing four residents in China's northeastern city of Helong, South Korea's Yonhap news agency and Dong-A Ilbo newspaper said. Both cited sources in the border areas between China and the North. Scroll down for video . A North Korean believed to be a runaway soldier killed four Chinese citizens during a robbery after he crossed the border into China in search of food, media reports said Monday . The victims were either shot dead or beaten to death, Dong-A said, adding he was later shot and captured by Chinese authorities. 'Killing several Chinese nationals... is a major crime, so there are good possibilities that China, unlike other runaway North Korean soldiers captured before, will not hand him over to the North,' said an unnamed Seoul official quoted by Yonhap. All able-bodied young men in the North are subject to 10 years of military service. Many army bases are known to suffer food shortage and starving troops often cross the border to China in search of food. Private markets cropping up across the North in recent years have helped ease starvation among ordinary citizens. Seoul's unification ministry that handles North Korea affairs declined to comment on the incident. 'Chinese authorities have already reached an agreement with the North not to officially announce it,' Yonhap quoted the Seoul official as saying. Dong-A said the victims were two elderly ethnic Korean couples.Koreans make up for about 30 per cent of the population in China's Yanbian Korean autonomous prefecture that borders the North. 'It has become pretty common for the past decade that North Koren soldiers sneak across the border at night to seek food here,' Dong-A quoted one resident of the area as saying. An official with the Yanbian police told AFP he had no knowledge of the reported incident. The border with China is a major route for escape for North Koreans fleeing poverty and repression at home. They also cross the border temporarily to find food and jobs. Thousands flee by secretly crossing into China and later travelling to a third country before seeking resettlement in the South.","A North Korean believed to be a runaway soldier killed four Chinese citizens during a robbery after he crossed the border into China in search of food, media reports said Monday.

88715,"The operations will include dedicated patrols and messages on road signs.
The move follows government plans to double fines and points for using a mobile while driving.
The National Police Chiefs' Council said the campaign aims ""to make 'driving distracted' as socially unacceptable as drink driving"".
The national week of action comes after a previous one in May, which the police said resulted in the detection of 2,323 offences across the week.
It comes after an RAC survey in September suggested the number of motorists illegally using mobile phones while at the wheel was rising.
Of the motorists asked, 31% said they had used a handheld phone behind the wheel compared with 8% in 2014.
As part of the latest campaign week, police officers will work together with paramedics to educate the public on the risks of using phones while driving.
The officers on the dedicated patrols will be using unmarked vans, helmet cams, high-seated vehicles and high vantage points to catch offenders, the police said.
There will also be social media videos and messages, schemes enabling ""community spotters"" to target repeat offenders, and messages which will be displayed on commuter routes telling motorists to leave their phones alone.
Paul Newman is the founder of charity Handsoff. His sister, Ellen, was killed by a driver who was using a mobile phone in 2006.
Mr Newman told BBC Radio 5 live ""all the policing in the world"" would not work and that the industry had a ""huge responsibility"" in fixing the problem.
""This is just the beginning, the car has been bombarded by technology and nobody is taking notice of it.
""It's worse than ever out there and it's never going to stop. There will be a crackdown but that will go away, give it a few weeks and back to normal. It won't work.""
He told the programme the act of motorists using mobile phones at the wheel should be treated worse than drink-driving.
Chief Constable Suzette Davenport from the NPCC said tackling mobile phone use by drivers needed ""innovative approaches"".
""When you're getting in your car, remember don't put others at risk - keep your eyes on the road and your hands on the wheel.""
Police should target the persistent offenders just like any other crime, AA president Edmund King told BBC Radio 5 live.
Drivers are ""addicted"" to their phones and there are lessons to be learnt from drink-driving and seatbelt campaigns, he said.
Mr King added it was crucial to have enforcement behind any ""hard-hitting"" campaign.
People checking social media and texting is much more common than taking calls at the wheel, PC Derek Kitcher of Gwent Police told BBC Radio 5 live's Breakfast programme.
He said most offenders do not realise that a police car is next to them until an officer beeps their horn.
Fellow officer Sgt Leighton Healan told the programme it was something that was becoming socially unacceptable and was a ""dangerous pastime"".
Drink-driving was a personal choice whereas mobile phone usage was almost a spontaneous offence, he said.
""What we want to do is educate people, raise awareness around the use of mobile phones and prevent it in the first place. As a police force I'm not always keen to issue that fine if education is better served.""",Police in Gwent are to launch a week-long campaign to crack down on drivers using mobile phones while driving.

""The fact that England have named a strong squad reflects that they know where Ireland are at,"" said White.
""These are huge occasions but they are a potential banana skin for England.""
White added: ""England have some great ball strikers and talented quick bowlers and it doesn't matter what XI they put out on the day, it's going to be a big task.
""Getting rid of the likes of Joe Root and Eoin Morgan early on is a priority so that they don't go on to make big scores.""
White, who is occupying the role of an assistant coach in an interim capacity, expects Ireland to be up for the fight despite the disappointment of their recent defeats by Afghanistan in an ODI series and an Intercontinental Cup encounter in India.
""No Irish team goes into fixtures against England without having that fire in their belly. I expect the Ireland players to be raring to go.
""Confidence has taken a knock but enough time has elapsed since the boys were out in India, where conditions are difficult for any touring side.
""We were disappointed, more so in the manner of the four-day defeat, but the guys will be more familiar with the conditions they face this week and will be ready to go.""

Ireland appear to be on the verge of securing Test status and the ex-North Down and Northamptonshire player says he takes ""immense pride in where the Irish team is now"" compared with when the 36-year-old made the first of his 232 appearances for Ireland in 2000.
""So many who have been part of that journey will look at Ireland walking down the pavilion steps at Lord's with a great sense of pride. I just hope the performance is worthy of the occasion.
""I played for Ireland against Sri Lanka at Lord's in a Twenty20 World Cup game (in 2009) and we were nine runs away from beating them. It was a fantastic occasion with a big crowd and the sun shining. Hopefully it will be something similar this week.
""Like playing at any iconic sporting venue across the world, it's about trying to adapt to the surroundings and trying not to let the occasion spoil what you are trying to do or take your mind off the game.""
White believes Ireland's cause will be boosted on Sunday by the fact that a number of the Irish squad have various degrees of experience of having performed at 'the home of cricket'.
""The history of the place (Lord's) is well known but a number of Ireland players have played there before.
""Paul Stirling plays most of his home games there and Ed Joyce has spent a large part of his career there, while Andrew Balbirnie was also a Middlesex player, so those guys are familiar with it and it will be business as usual. They won't make too much of the venue.
""It may be different for the likes of Andrew McBrine, who learnt all his cricket at Donemana. Lord's is a million miles away from Donemana in terms of size of venue and everything else.
""But he'll have the day before to take in the surroundings and come game day he'll be ready to play. At the end of the day, it's Ireland against England - that's the biggest thing about it.""
Ireland have previously played five home ODIs against England and two in global tournaments, famously securing a three-wicket win in the 2011 World Cup.
Kevin O'Brien and Paul Stirling have overcome hamstring and finger injuries respectively, but fast bowler Boyd Rankin is ruled out with a back problem.

OLYMPIC horsewoman Lucinda Fredericks has split from her Australian husband Clayton after 15 years of marriage. ‘He’s gone back to Australia and we are getting divorced,’ Lucinda tells me sadly. ‘I’m still in shock.’ A golden girl of British equestrian sport, Lucinda, 46, won silver at Beijing. Everything seemed to be going brilliantly for her and her husband, with whom she set up a thriving equestrian business. Lucinda Fredericks competing at the Badminton Horse Trials. Her husband Clayton has moved back to Australia and they are to divorce . But last year Clayton flew back to his homeland. ‘I’ve no idea why he left me,’ she says. Now Lucinda admits she is finding it a struggle being a single parent to their ten-year-old daughter — and the rigours of managing her business. She has already run into difficulties, upsetting locals in her Wiltshire village who are annoyed about the continuing presence of a ‘temporary’ mobile home and stables for which she had no planning consent. Lucinda says: ‘All I’m trying to do is my best to survive. Life has been difficult since Clayton.’ IT'S early days yet, but the next time Prince Philip wants alterations to his many well-worn suits, he may need to congratulate his Savile Row tailor Patrick Grant. Oxford-educated Grant, who  steps out with Victoria Beckham’s handbag designer, Kate Hillier, is itching to start a family. ‘I’m 41 and we’ve been together for six years, so I’m more than ready for parenthood,’ he tells me at a Hardlyever wornit.com fashion charity party at the Dorchester. ‘I am hoping I don’t have  to wait too much longer.’ YOU would have thought having Abu Hamza as a neighbour would hardly have been good for property values. But just over a year after the hook-handed preacher was deported to the U.S., former business minister Lord Hutton has been leading by enterprising example. Lord Hutton has put his £1.4million West London home on the market following the extradition of Abu Hamza . Eight years after moving in next door to the Hamza household, he has put his West London home on the market for £1.4 million. As plain John Hutton, the ex-Labour Cabinet member bought the Shepherd’s Bush property for £565,000. Two years later — and at the height of Hamza’s extradition battle— he put it on the market for £1 million but it did not sell. The five-bedroom, end-of-terrace property is being advertised with a local estate agency. Although the agent mentions its ‘proximity to many local amenities’, no reference is made to the Hamza clan, who still live in their council-owned house. Piano man: Billy Joel entertained diners on a recent evening out at Princess Diana's favourite restaurant . CROONER Billy Joel, on tour in the UK, popped in for lunch at one of Princess Diana’s favourite restaurants, La Famiglia in Chelsea, booking a quiet table in the window. But it didn’t stay quiet for long. For as he waited for his seared tuna and rocket salad, Billy, 64, delighted fellow diners by suddenly breaking into song. ‘It was all very jolly,’ says one. ‘He was with a group of 12 all wearing leather jackets. Among them was the singer Graham Parker and his group The Rumour.’ Joel, who wrote Uptown Girl for his then wife supermodel Christie Brinkley, was later heard praising rocker Jerry Lee Lewis. ‘He was the one for me, great guy,’ he told the group.

Millionaire’s daughter  Laura, 30, married Eurosports bigwig  Dennis Smith, five years her senior,  at her father’s Frankfurt estate. She excitedly tells me: ‘We’ve been together for five years. I’m no Bridezilla, but I wanted to get married while my parents are still alive. ‘I wore a traditional white dress and my grandmother’s diamond engagement ring, which she somehow managed to retain through Auschwitz so it was a moving moment. ‘We had a few days in France, but we couldn’t take a honeymoon because we are too busy working.’ Laura left home for Hollywood as a teenager and now lives in London. ‘I met Dennis at a  dingy little club in Kings Cross and it was love at first sight!’ she says.  ‘We had a few vodka shots for a little courage and since then  we’ve been inseparable.’ Laura is rehearsing new play Dogstar, which premieres next week at Chiswick’s Tabard Theatre before the comedy transfers to the West End. Her mother, Minka, is an esteemed academic and documentary  film maker. ‘Despite her serious work, she is supportive of what I’m doing,’ says Laura. JUST four days after the death of PR genius Lesley Lake, who helped Barbara Hulanicki create the iconic Biba store, her grieving widower, writer Charles Mosley, has died, too. The couple died in the same hospital, Stoke Mandeville. ‘She would have been glad to go first,’ says Lesley’s daughter Miranda, whose father was wine merchant Michael Druitt. Lesley, 81, had been divorced many years when she met Old Etonian  genealogist Mosley, 65, editor of Burke’s Peerage, at a New Year’s Eve party in the Nineties.

6331,"America takes its ski destination names seriously. And one rebranding exercise saw a lawsuit between two popular ski areas in the US, after Salt Lake City, Utah, named itself Ski City USA. The name somewhat overshadowed Steamboat Springs, Colorado, which has long been known as Ski Town USA. The Great Debate: Visit Salt Lake attempted to introduce the moniker 'Ski City USA' but Steamboat Springs, Colorado, filed a lawsuit in response. Pictured: Salt Lake City, Utah . The 100-year-old town of Steamboat Springs has been known as 'Ski Town USA' since 1959 . Colorado's Steamboat Ski & Resort, which had been known as Ski Town since 1959, soon launched a federal lawsuit alleging a trademark violation. 'They are attempting to leverage our brand and our brand equity,' Steamboat's SVP of sales and marketing, Rob Perlman, was quoted as saying last month. Visit Salt Lake, however, argued that their winter marketing campaign, which cost approximately USD$1.8 million (£1.15 million), simply highlighted the differences between urban and rural ski destinations. 'Just as each ski town has its individual traits and attributes, Ski City USA is unique,' read a statement issued from Visit Salt Lake in October. Initially, tourism board, Visit Salt Lake protested the cease and desist. Pictured: Deer Valley ski resort, near Salt Lake City . The settlement was reached on November 14, with Visit Salt Lake agreeing to remove the 'USA' from the 'Ski City USA' promotional materials. Pictured: Steamboat Springs, Colorado . 'Ski City USA provides a distinct alternative to the ski town experience.' Further details of the settlement, which was reached on November 14, remain confidential but nevertheless, Visit Salt Lake has agreed to drop the 'USA' from the name, going by 'Ski City' instead. Steamboat Ski & Resort Corp. has, in return, dropped the lawsuit. 'Steamboat appreciates Visit Salt Lake's willingness to revise their campaign in order to address the concerns that resulted in a court filing,' explained Steamboat's SVP of sales and marketing, Rob Perlman. 'We are pleased to have resolved this matter amicably before the start of the winter season and I want to thank Visit Salt Lake for working with us so quickly.' 'Steamboat appreciates Visit Salt Lake's willingness to revise their campaign,' says a statement issued by Steamboat Ski & Resort Corp . Salt Lake City remains a premier ski destination, welcoming over 4.1 million skiers last season. Pictured: The St. Regis Hotel in Deer Valley . True to their word, Visit Salt Lake has amended its website, but insists that the campaign's aim remains the same. 'The Ski City campaign is unique and will continue to promote a distinct alternative experience - the benefits of an urban community teeming with restaurants, professional sports teams, cultural offerings and abundant hotel options,' Visit Salt Lake CEO Scott Beck said. 'Visit Salt Lake recognizes that towns like Steamboat Springs are iconic in what they offer to winter enthusiasts and is pleased to reach an agreement on this matter to further distinguish these two unique locations.' During the 2013 season, Salt Lake City and its surrounding ski hills hosted hosted 4.1 million skier visits.","Visit Salt Lake attempted to introduce the moniker 'Ski City USA' Steamboat Springs, Colorado, has been known as 'Ski Town USA' since 1959.

14283,"Veteran disc jockey Paul Gambaccini has told of his ‘12 months of horror and trauma’ after being told he will not face sexual assault charges. The 65-year-old was arrested by officers from Operation Yewtree last October following allegations of sexual abuse. After almost a year the Crown Prosecution Service yesterday confirmed that they will not be taking any further action against the openly gay DJ. The radio DJ denied allegations of historic sexual offences when he was arrested by Operation Yewtree detectives last year . But at the same time the CPS revealed for the first time that the allegations against him involved two underage boys who were around 14 and 15. No mention of alleged paedophilia had been made public before. Gambaccini previously compared his situation to the deep injustice inflicted on impoverished black Americans in Alabama in the 1930s. Last night after learning he could not face charges, he said: ‘Since I was falsely accused last year, the Scottsboro Boys have received posthumous pardons and I have been completely cleared. These are results. Mr Gambaccini (left) presenting Top of the Pops with David Hamilton and Mike Read. Gambaccini will not face further charges over alleged sex offences . The presenter joined the BBC in 1973 as a reporter for a music show. He is pictured with Noel Edmonds as he celebrates his last ever breakfast show with, from left to right, Peter Powell,  paedophile Jimmy Savile, Dave Lee Travis, Noel Edmonds, Simon Bates, David 'Kid' Jenson and Tony Blackburn . ‘There may be members of the Press who will ask me to give interviews or make provocative statements. I will politely decline. ‘To discuss horror in this way is to trivialise it. I will never trivialise the 12 months of trauma to which I have been unjustly subjected. I would like to thank my friends, my lawyers and the people of this country for their support during the past year. ‘Wherever I have gone, I have been stopped in the street by members of the public offering encouragement. I am very grateful. I’ll be back at work soon Thank you.’ The CPS said that it had already informed the complainants there would be no charges, but it would write to them in more detail, and would offer a meeting should they want the failure to charge discussed further. After almost one year, the CPS confirmed they will not be taking any further action against the openly gay DJ . Jimmy Savile (left) was exposed as a serial child abuser in a documentary shown two years ago. Since then, a handful of British celebrities have been faced trial for sexual offences including Max Clifford (right) who was sentenced to eight years in jail . The CPS statement has added fuel to controversy over the wide-ranging Operation Yewtree inquiry, launched in the wake of the late Jimmy Savile being unmasked as a prolific paedophile. Other celebrities including comedians Jim Davidson and Jimmy Tarbuck have had their names dragged through the mud after Yewtree investigated them over decades-old allegations. In July, Stephen Fry blasted Yewtree for gaining convictions for less than half the suspects. Last night Conservative MP Nigel Evans – who resigned as House of Commons deputy speaker before being cleared of sex assault charges in court in April – called for suspects to be guaranteed anonymity unless charged. Rolf Harris (left) was found guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault and Stuart Hall (right) is serving a 30-month sentence . Gambaccini’s solicitor Kate Goold complained that the US-born DJ, who lives in London, had fully cooperated throughout his ordeal but his bail was repeatedly extended with little explanation. She added: ‘We are delighted with the outcome but deeply concerned at the length of time it took to resolve this investigation. Paul made his innocence clear at the outset and questions remain as to why this investigation took so long.’ Last night, the CPS insisted its mention of the age of the boys at the time of the alleged offences, and its public explanation of how it would discuss the lack of charges with them, were all ‘in accordance with guidelines’. Dubbed the Professor of Pop for his encyclopedic knowledge of music, Paul Gambaccini had been a BBC radio DJ for 16 years when he was arrested last year. The 65-year-old, who is openly gay, was born in New York. He gained citizenship to the UK in 2005 despite starting with with the Corporation in 1973 as a reporter on John Steel's Radio 1 show, Rockspeak. He read politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University as well as studying at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. Despite his success, Mr Gambaccini said he was victim to homophobic treatment within the BBC where his personnel file was reportedly marked with a Christmas tree as he was 'camp as Christmas'. He entered into a civil partnership with model Christopher Sherwood in 2012. Following an ITV documentary in 2012 which exposed the depraved paedophilia of Jimmy Savile, Gambaccini publicly condemned the Jim'll Fix It star, describing him as 'an enigma'. 'He was not all good, he was not all bad, he was an enigma.,' he said on Daybreak. 'You just didn't mess with Jim. 'He was the governor, because after all he had been the first great club DJ, he had been the originator of Top Of The Pops and you just let him have his turf. 'And none of us were interested in going there. 'At social occasions we would all be together, but Jim would not be. He had his own life,' he said on live television. He added he had been waiting for 30 years for the public to be made aware Savile's abuse. 'I’ve been waiting for this to come out for 30 years, but then he did raise millions for charity. 'This comes out when he’s dead because he had an imperial personality in showbiz, and I’m not talking about personal life.' 'Once he was phoned and he said, ""Well, you could run that story, but if you do there goes the funds that come in to Stoke Mandeville Hospital. ""Do you want to be responsible for the drying up of the charity donations?"" And they backed down.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",The 65-year-old was arrested by Operation Yewtree detectives last October. He denied historic sexual offences and said he was victim to homophobic treatment. The CPS confirmed they will not be taking any further action.

34944,"Convicted: Waseem Daker, now 35, spent a decade behind bars for stalking Loretta Blatz; he was found guilty of killing her roommate . A man who became obsessed with a woman on his paintball team and proceeded to stalk her is now on trial for the murder of the woman's roommate. In an unnerving twist, Waseem Daker fired his court-appointed lawyer so now he is the one questioning Loretta Spencer Blatz, the woman who he used to stalk and who was the reason why he spent 10 years behind bars. Ms Blatz's former roommate, Karmen Smith, was killed in October 1996. Smith was found strangled to death and her five-year-old son Nickolas was stabbed multiple times during the attack but survived and will be testifying later in the trial. Daker, who is now 35-years-old, met Ms Blatz when the two were on the same paintball team in Georgia. They became close when Daker, who was then only a teenager enrolled at Georgia Tech University, began confiding in Ms Blatz. 'I felt like his bigger sister. He was reaching out and needing somebody. He told me he didn’t have anyone to talk to. I was trying to help him,' she said in court according to The Marietta Daily Journal. Daker was 12 years her junior and soon after they became friends, their relationship turned more serious. While Daker is arguing in court that they were on-again-off-again lovers, Ms Blatz has always denied that version of events and said that he began calling her at the home where she lived with her then-10-year-old daughter 50 or 100 times a day. 'He would get extremely irate and say I was the only one he had to talk to and would kill himself if I would not talk to him. I told him he needed to seek professional help,' Ms Blatz said. 'The more I told him no, the more he was really persistent in talking to me.' The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports that Daker is attempting to brand Ms Blatz a liar since a number of threatening instances that she claims against Daker- like when he allegedly threatened to slit her daughter's throat, tried to run her car off the road, or when he hung bras and underwear on her doorknob her for her to find- were never reported to police. 'Many things may not be on this report,' she said in court, unable to contain her tears. 'My intention was to get (the stalking) to stop. At the time I didn't know it would lead to what it... what it led to.' Scene: At the time of her murder, Karmen Smith lived in the basement apartment of the house on Old Hunter's Trace (pictured) where  Loretta Blatz lived in Marietta, Georgia, . In an effort to cut him off, she and her daughter moved from Roswell to Cobb County, but that didn't end his unwanted attention. 'I walked into my apartment and heard my clock radio on. In my bedroom was Waseem Daker ... He was naked and he had a garter belt and garter hose on and was looking at himself in my mirror,' she said of one such incident. Shortly after that May 1995 incident, she called the police and he was arrested, though she later dropped the charges after he promised that he would get help. Months later Ms Smith, a Delta flight attendant who lived in the basement of Ms Blatz's home, was found dead. Daker was always listed as a possible suspect but at the time there was not enough evidence to charge him with the crime. The next year, Daker was convicted of stalking Ms Blatz and spent the following 10 years in jail. Though he was released in 2006, it wasn't until 2009 when DNA testing was able to link Daker to the Smith crime scene when they traced several hairs on the victim's body to him. One of the most intense portions of the trial was the cross examination of Ms Blatz by her convicted stalker. At one point, ABC News reports that Daker tried to have the judge label some portion of her testimony as 'inappropriate'. 'Well, you know, it’s really inappropriate that you stalk me and harass me, and you’re sitting here asking me questions, and I have to come back with you and answer your questions, that’s hard for me!' she said.","Waseem Daker, now 35, is on trial for the murder of Loretta Blatz's former roommate, Karmen Smith, in October 1996. Ms Blatz claims that Daker stalked her because he was the only one on his paintball team. Daker was convicted of stalking Ms Blatz and spent 10 years behind bars."

The Tories said on Saturday they plan to raise personal tax allowances to Â£12,500.
The Liberal Democrats have announced proposals to boost apprenticeships.
After rejecting any coalition while on a visit to Deeside, Mr Miliband said Labour having a majority government would be in the ""best interest for Wales and the best interest of the UK"".
He said: ""There's a big choice at this election. Do we have a Conservative government with David Cameron which runs the country for the richest and most powerful people?
""Or do we have a Labour government led by me which puts working people first?""
But, on Friday, Prime Minister David Cameron said people in Wales knew ""more than most the damage Labour can do"".
Launching the Conservative election manifesto for Wales, in Powys, Mr Cameron said it was both ""hypocrisy"" and a source of shame that Welsh Labour had not protected health spending in the way his government had in England.
Mr Miliband responded: ""The way David Cameron has approached the issue is using Wales as a political football not trying to address the real reasons for this.""
He also defended the record of the Welsh Labour government and would not put a figure on future funding for Wales.
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has also accused Labour of hypocrisy, for attacking Conservative public spending cuts while refusing to commit to reversing those cuts.
Plaid Cymru MPs would not support a minority Labour government ""that at its heart represents the worst excesses of austerity"", she warned.
But they have called for parity with Scotland on funding, saying it would amount to an extra Â£1.2bn a year to the Welsh budget.
Also on Saturday, the Liberal Democrats announced what it calls plans to scrap the ""jobs tax on young employees"".

A new study also shows Brits rate looking good at the office Christmas party more important than a first date or a new job. However, post Christmas, we don't show the commitment needed to follow through with their regime. People in UK are hoping to lose an average of half a stone in festive run-up, with 47 per cent are starting their healthy 'pre-tox' fitness regime in next week in preparation for extra-eating over Christmas . In a poll conducted on 2,000 UK adults, half questioned revealed that they are 'pre-toxing', but only a third admitted they expect to see their diet and fitness regime through to the New Year. 47 per cent of us are starting our healthy 'pre-tox' fitness regime in the next week, with almost a quarter revealing the motivation was looking good at their office Christmas party. Instead of just relying on some old-fashioned jogging and calorie-counting, thousands have turned to new technology in an effort to beat the bulge. Nearly a fifth of those questioned admitted to using wearable technology or juicing machines to stay on track. Almost a quarter said motivation is looking good at their Christmas party . Data from Currys PC World supports the pre-tox trend and shows a 20% increase in sales of its juicers and 27% increase in its wearable products per week. The survey showed that women take pre-Christmas slimming down more seriously, with men only thinking about shaping up for Christmas towards the end of November, two weeks after women begin their weight loss effort. 80 per cent of people believe that they put on weight during the Christmas period, with some putting on as much as 8lb from over-eating. 80 per cent of people believe that they put on weight during the Christmas period, with some putting on as much as 8lb from over-eating .

'My clients regularly turn to their Philips Avances or Tom Tom Runners to make exercise and healthy living a little more exciting.' 1. Walking a little faster is a great way to burn off some extra calories. Aim to walk at a speed of 4 miles per hour, as this helps you burn fat. 2. In the office, set a timer on a watch or your phone and every 20 minutes, simply stand up and move if even for a few seconds. After 20 minutes of sitting the body starts to slow down the amount of calories you burn, so just move every 20 minutes to keep it fully active. 3. Ditch the biscuit tin and swap for a smoothie and save calories and get your vitamins at the same time. 4. Every day, challenge yourself to burn off an extra 100 calories over the build up to Christmas, this way you can have banked and be in credit by at least 2,400 calories. 5. Skipping for 10 minutes can burn up to 135 calories and at the same time sculpts and tones your lower body. 6. Keep your body fuller for longer by adding in some oats to your smoothies, throwing these into your blender will help stabilise your blood sugar levels so you will be less tempted to snack on the mince pies in the office. 7. Taking the stairs take two at a time, this works your thighs and butt harder and avoid using the hand rail as then you contract your abs more for balance. 8. Music is a great motivator, so create a new playlist and name it 'My Pre-tox Christmas Playlist' then listen to this when you work out. 9. Keep your workout gear on the radiator as this way you are more likely to slip into it and head out in the winter for a quick workout. 10. Apply the two D's which are simply 'determination' and 'discipline' and you will get you the desired results. Just make sure you stay on track with your pre-tox of smoothies and exercise. Ben Lovett, Currys PC World spokesperson, added: 'Brits are becoming more health conscious than ever and the beauty of juicers and wearable products is that they are easy to use on a daily basis.

12720,"I believe it was December of '98 when my dad passed away of an overdose. A few weeks later, around my 10th birthday, I was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome and Asperger's syndrome. It was a really rough time, especially at that age, being told I have a neurological ""disease,"" when I already felt so different. At that point I was being bullied for being different, having big ears, and now for having no dad AND for making weird faces and noises I couldn't control. I was a walking target. Then my mom discovered a musical interest in me after my older sister was in musical theater at her high school. I learned all the songs from the show ""Damn Yankees"" and at the final performance, the director let me go onstage (my first time onstage) and perform with the cast! I was hooked instantly and for some reason it felt right. Although I felt I had found ""my place,"" I still had to go back to my own school. The bullying just kept getting worse. I didn't know what to do anymore. I remember I even had thoughts of suicide and hurting myself. When I turned 12, I was given a hand-me-down guitar and a chord book. I studied those basic chords and learned how to play the basic songs. Throughout this process, I figured out that no matter how bad of a day I had at school, I could come home and create my own world within the music. I could make the music as happy or as sad as I wanted it to be. I used the pain from being bullied to transform me into who I was meant to be.

52723,"Venus has so far enjoyed two wins in four days, since stepping up to take charge following Mowbray's departure.
It is a role he performed for three games when Mowbray left his previous club Middlesbrough - but it is not yet clear whether Venus may stop at City.
""I don't want to just go for the job if I can't do it properly and give them what they need,"" Venus told BBC Sport.
""There's no time schedule. It's however long it takes to get the right person. The board will take due diligence on the all the applicants.
""I'm privy to all the conversations with the board. I'm very much included. It's an ongoing process. We just have to take our time and pick the right candidate.""
A suspension of betting by bookmakers triggered rumours of an announcement, but City have advised that will not happen this week.
Until coming to Coventry, Venus had not had a day-to-day coaching role since his brief caretaker role ended with Aitor Karanka's appointment following Mowbray's departure from Boro in October 2013.
When Mowbray then returned to football at Coventry in March 2015, his long-time number two Venus joined as technical director, in a scouting, not a training ground role.
""I've been out of the grass for two and three quarter years,"" Venus told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire. ""I need to feel if I can be of benefit to the club. That's something I need to find out before I decide whether I can take the club further.
""It was really one of the low points of my career when Tony decided to resign. I'd hoped he could turn the club round that I'd maybe have a different role and that we'd build this club up again.
""It was not to be but, on a professional front, you have to readjust. It's a difficult time, but we have to move forward. The players have given me maximum effort. I can ask no more that.""
After City's first League One win in 11 attempts this season, to lift themselves off the bottom of the League One table, Tuesday night's 3-1 win over former landlords Northampton Town saw them qualify for the second round of the EFL Trophy.
Following the postponement of this weekend's scheduled home game against Chesterfield due to international commitments, Coventry do not play again until visiting 18th-placed Charlton Athletic on 15 October, followed by successive home games against Oxford United and Rochdale.
And Venus hopes that, at a time when City's long-suffering fans remain disenchanted with the club's owners, they may have turned a corner.
""I understand the feelings the fans have got,"" he said. ""But I want them to support the club. Everyone needs to get together. If we can get positive vibes, then they can enjoy their football.""","Coventry City caretaker coach Paul Venus says he is ""very much included"" in the selection process for the job."
63218,"The Behavioural Insights Team points to scientific and economic data showing people eat 3,000 calories, compared to the 2,000 cited in official surveys.
It says this could explain rising obesity levels, despite decades of surveys saying people are eating less.
Government statisticians say the way calorie data is collated will change.
Several official surveys, including the National Diet and Nutrition Survey and the Living Costs and Food Survey, suggest the amount of food people eat and buy has gone down in recent decades - while obesity rates continue to rise.
But the researchers from the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) say if the calorie counts in these surveys were correct, the UK population would be losing weight overall.
The BIT is an independent company but started its life in 2010 as a government policy group known as the ""nudge unit"" because it was tasked with encouraging people into making better life choices.
Its study points to scientific studies including chemical analysis of how much energy people burn, that show people are eating about 1,000 more calories a day per person than surveys would suggest.
National spending figures also suggest we are buying more food than we report in surveys, the authors say.
They suggest there could be many reasons people are not accurately reporting what they eat, including snacks being difficult to track, a desire to lose weight making them less likely to be honest about their eating habits, and fewer people taking part in the surveys overall.
Researchers also looked at the theory that a drop in physical activity was the main reason for rising weight gain.
But they say if a reduction in exercise was solely responsible, every single adult nationally would need to have eliminated more than three-and-a-half hours of daily walking since the 1970s to account for the changes.
They suggest policymakers trying to curb obesity should focus more on reducing calorie intake than promoting exercise.
Lead researcher Michael Hallsworth, director of health at the BIT, said: ""Anyone who has been on a treadmill will know what it feels like to look down and see you have burned far fewer calories than you expected.
""Physical activity is good for your health and heart but reducing calories is a more effective strategy to combat obesity.""
Public health expert Prof Alan Maryon-Davis described the report as an ""interesting and very soundly argued analysis"".
He added: ""This will send a shudder through the junk-food industry.
""Up until now they've been able to point to what was thought to be a decline in the nation's calorie intake and say there's really no need for tougher measures like a sugar tax, fat tax or calorie-labelling on alcoholic drinks.
""But this latest analysis rather pulls the rug from under their feet.""
The Behavioural Insights Team, which is jointly owned by the UK government and charity Nesta, applies insights from academic research in behavioural economics and psychology to public policy and services.","The UK population is eating more calories per day than the 2,000 cited in official surveys, a new study suggests."

Described as ‘possibly the most amazing fossil in the world’, the bones of the dinosaurs who fought to the death 65million years ago are expected to fetch a record-breaking £6million at auction in November. They were unearthed in Montana in 2006 and depict a ‘sensational prehistoric death match between predator and prey’.

The Bonham’s auction house in New York describes the fossil as ‘breathtaking’ and adds: ‘The remarkable state of the skeletons indicates the pair was buried very shortly after the fatal struggle.’ Manchester University palaeontologist Philip Manning said the lot was ‘possibly the most amazing fossil in the world’. He added: ‘It was a bad day for both of them. If you’re cornered by a top predator you will do everything you can to stop yourself being eaten.

The Football Association is probing two cases of  in England.
""There is no racism [on the field], but maybe there is a word or gesture that is not correct,"" Blatter told CNN. ""The one affected by this should say this is a game and shake hands.""
The 75-year-old later said his comments had been misunderstood.
""I would like to make it very clear, I am committed to the fight against racism and any type of discrimination in football and in society,"" Blatter said in a statement.
""I have been personally leading this battle against racism in football, which Fifa has been fighting through campaigns such as Say No to Racism.""
The Swiss added: ""My comments have been misunderstood. What I wanted to express is that, as football players, during a match, you have battles with your opponents and sometimes things are done which are wrong.
""But, normally, at the end of the match, you apologise to your opponent if you had a confrontation during the match, you shake hands, and when the game is over, it is over.""
In his original interview, Blatter had appeared to downplay the extent of racism in the modern game.
Asked whether he thought racism on the pitch was a problem, Blatter told CNN World Sport: ""I would deny it. There is no racism.
""There is maybe one of the players towards another - he has a word or a gesture which is not the correct one.
""But the one who is affected by that, he should say: 'This is a game. We are in a game, and at the end of the game, we shake hands.' And this can happen, because we have worked so hard against racism and discrimination.""
Blatter's comments , with England and Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand tweeting: ""Tell me I have just read Sepp Blatter's comments on racism in football wrong....if not then I am astonished.""
Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, former Tottenham Hotspur striker Garth Crooks was equally critical of Blatter's remarks.
""Clearly Sepp Blatter is a man who's never suffered from racism,"" he said. ""I'm shocked and somewhat dismayed.""
This is one of Sepp Blatter's worst gaffes, without a doubt. On the day that Blatter says there is no racism in football, the FA has charged Luis Suarez with just that. The FA is taking a tough stance on racism and this could lead to a lengthy ban, potentially. If someone is found guilty of racial abuse the FA will, I'm sure, throw the book at them.
Piara Powar, executive director of the Football Against Racism in Europe network, also condemned Blatter's comments.
""You just don't expect the world leader of football to be coming out with comments that seem ill-thought-out, [and] insensitive,"" he said.
""To say that something as serious as racial abuse between players can be settled with a handshake is incorrect and not the sort of thing footballers at an amateur level, at a pro level - at any level - will want to hear from football's leader.""
The remarks from the Fifa president, who has led football's world governing body since 1998 and was re-elected this year, come on the same day as Liverpool striker Luis Suarez was charged by the FA for alleged racist comments towards Manchester United's Patrice Evra.
The accusation is denied by the Uruguayan and his club say he will plead not guilty to the FA charge.

Hedge fund boss Bill Browder said it was possible a ""murderer may be running around"".  Surrey Police said it would co-operate with the coroner.
The hearing into Mr Perepilichnyy's death was told new toxicology information showed a potential marker for a rare poison called Gelsemium elegans in his body.
A full inquest is due to take place in Woking on 21 September.
Mr Browder, CEO of London-based Hermitage Capital Management, said Mr Perepilichnyy gave information to his organisation about the Sergei Magnitsky affair.
Magnitsky, a lawyer for Hermitage, died on remand in a Moscow prison in 2009 after uncovering an alleged $230m (Â£150m) tax fraud involving Russian government officials.
Surrey Police said in 2013 Mr Perepilichnyy's death was not suspicious and he was believed to have been running before he collapsed.
""He was co-operating against dangerous people,"" said Mr Browder.
""He thought there was a contract out on his life and now they have found poison in his stomach.
""They absolutely should reopen the investigation and if they don't it seems to me you have a murderer running around having got away with murder.""

A judge yesterday said he had no choice but to give a ‘ridiculously short’ prison sentence to a driver who horrifically injured a policeman known as ‘Robocop’. Diederik Coetzee, who made an astonishing 404 arrests in 2006, was thrown 24ft from his bicycle in the hit and run. Ten months on, the once super-fit 55-year-old is still in hospital and has had to end his remarkable career. The driver, Mitchel Graham, sped from the scene, leaving the constable lying in the road. But Judge Jonathan Teare QC said Parliament had decided he could give Graham no more than 15 months behind bars. ‘That may seem ridiculously short for those who grieve for the loss of their husband and father, but that is all I can do,’ he told Nottingham Crown Court. The maximum sentence for dangerous driving is two years but a shorter term is given to offenders who plead guilty. Graham admitted dangerous driving and failing to stop. The court heard he knew his car was in a highly dangerous condition when he ploughed into Mr Coetzee, who was off duty and cycling to an exercise class in Blidworth, Nottinghamshire, at 6pm on November 25. Paul Stimson, prosecuting, said the drive shaft, exhaust and brakes of Graham’s car were defective and the tyres were worn.

63672,"Mr Renzi formally resigned on Monday after his defeat in a constitutional referendum a day earlier, but the president requested the delay.
President Sergio Mattarella will later have to either choose a new prime minister or call early elections.
European leaders have been playing down the risks of fallout from the crisis.
It comes amid fears of long-term instability for the country's troubled banking sector in the long-term. Shares in Italian banks lost ground following news of Mr Renzi's defeat.
Sunday's No vote on constitutional reform was widely seen as a rejection of establishment politics in Italy.
Mr Renzi held a final brief cabinet meeting on Monday evening, before travelling to the presidential palace to submit his formal resignation.
President Mattarella then asked him to stay on for the budget bill, which is expected to be passed by the Senate in a matter of days.
He wanted to avoid ""the risks of a provisional budget"", the president said in a statement (in Italian).
The BBC's James Reynolds in Rome says the move will help to reassure markets that the referendum result has not derailed the country's affairs.
Anti-establishment opposition parties have been calling for early elections, although it is unclear yet whether this will happen.
Instead, the president may appoint a caretaker administration led by Mr Renzi's Democratic Party, which would carry on until an election due in the spring of 2018.
Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan is the favourite to succeed Mr Renzi as prime minister.
The No vote won with nearly 60% against 40% for the Yes campaign. With a turnout of nearly 70%, it was a heavier than expected defeat for the government.
Mr Renzi staked his political future on his attempt to change Italy's cumbersome political system. He wanted to strengthen central government and weaken the Senate, the upper house of parliament.
His opponents - including some within his own party - had argued that the reforms would give the prime minister too much power. The electorate agreed.
More than a resounding victory for the No camp, it was a chance for a medley of populist parties to reject establishment politics.
The opposition, headed by the Five Star Movement, capitalised on Mr Renzi's declining popularity, years of economic stagnation, and the problems caused by tens of thousands of migrants arriving in Italy from Africa.
After the vote, Mr Renzi defended his record, saying exports and job numbers were up and unemployment was down to 11.7%.
Five Star's leader, Beppe Grillo, has called for an election ""within a week"".
The result is being seen as a blow to the EU, although there is no question of Italy leaving the union.
Both Five Star and the Northern League are opposed to the eurozone but not to membership of the EU itself.
Reuters news agency quoted German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble as saying there was no reason for a euro crisis but that Italy urgently needed a functioning government.
Meanwhile, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel said she ""took note with regret"" of Mr Renzi's resignation but Germany would offer to work closely with the next Italian government.
But the leader of the far-right Front National in France, Marine Le Pen, tweeted: ""The Italians have disavowed the EU and Renzi. We must listen to this thirst for freedom of nations.""
Markets seemed to have taken Mr Renzi's departure in their stride. The euro fell initially to a 20-month low but rebounded again. Shares in Italian banks lost ground on Monday afternoon, following a dip and rebound in the morning.
But there are concerns over the long-term financial stability in the eurozone's third largest economy. The economy is 12% smaller than when the financial crisis began in 2008.
The banks remain weak and the country's debt-to-GDP ratio, at 133%, (second only to Greece's in the eurozone) means many Italian banks are in need of refinancing.
There is a risk that the failure of a major bank - such as the troubled Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena - could set off a wider crisis, but repairing the banks becomes more difficult amid political uncertainty.","Italy's president has asked his former prime minister, Michelangelo Renzi, to stay on for the budget bill to be passed by the Senate."

Mr McCrea and Mr White had flown from L.A. to Chicago O’Hare International Airport and were heading back to Mr McCrea’s apartment when they jumped into the taxi. After sharing what they say was a short kiss, Anshur became adamant they exit the cab, claiming 'you can't do this -this is public transportation'. When they protested, he began 'driving recklessly and swerving into traffic', reports the Chicagoist. He ejected them on the Kennedy Expressway in the pouring rain at around midnight prompting the couple to call the police. One-second kiss: In an interview after the incident, the couple demonstrated what the kiss was like that got them thrown out of the taxi on to a busy freeway . When officers arrived, the driver, who was waiting in a grocery store in Park Ridge, said they were 'making sex' in the back of his cab  - a claim strongly denied by Mr McCrea and Mr White. The couple say their kiss was a second in length and was something any heterosexual couple could do without drawing any negative repercussions. Anshur has since claimed: 'I told them to stop, it was raining. I couldn't drive with something like that. I have to drive safely because it's raining,' ABC News reports. Pick up: The men were collected in a taxi outside Chicago O’Hare International Airport (above -  cab pictured is from a different company and in no way associated with the incident) In a recent interview with WGN TV, Steven White said: 'Even in states like Illinois, where gays and lesbians are protected by the law, there is still discrimination and there are people that are against us. 'So I think it's just bringing more attention to the issue.' The pair are suing for an undisclosed amount of money.

14268,"Between October and the end of December almost 1,000 trains were cancelled or delayed due to driver shortages.
Managing Director Patrick Verwer said he was confident the company's problems had been tackled.
Train drivers union Aslef, however, said it was impossible to rule out further shortages in future.
Mr Verwer said London Midland had first identified it would have a shortage of drivers during the summer.
He said: ""We knew we had a massive problem coming up... due to a higher turnover than anticipated.
""Training up a driver and getting them into effective operation will take at least a year, so there was this big challenge.
""People are obviously looking for a continued, punctual, good, reliable service and I'm fully aware, and everyone else is at London Midland, that we've let our passengers down over the last four months.""
He said alongside training up more staff, London Midland had restructured its rotas to make them more efficient.
Last month the rail operator was told to offer a £7m compensation package to passengers.
Mr Verwer said: ""It was not what were were supposed to deliver and therefore people are entitled to be frustrated.
""We need to work hard, very hard, to win them back.""
National organiser for Aslef, Simon Weller, said London Midland and some other operators had become ""effectively a kindergarten"" for drivers.
He said it cost an estimated £70,000 to train drivers up because of the time and resources needed.
According to Aslef, London Midland pays drivers more than £10,000 a year less than Cross Country in basic salary.
""If Cross Country puts up an advert at Birmingham New Street saying it wants 30 drivers, there's virtually a stampede,"" Mr Weller said.
He said job satisfaction was also a reason for taking up a job with another rail operator.
""There's no chance to progress at London Midland, there's no light at the end of the tunnel.
""They do all the gutsy work, suburban routes with lots of stations. You can almost see the tail light of the train in front.  It's intense work, you have to concentrate.
""It's pretty mind-numbing and monotonous.""","A shortage of train drivers at London Midland has led to a ""massive problem"" for the company, the company has said."

89460,"Gang members who are more likely to commit violent crimes can now be identified by police using Minority Report-style software. London's Metropolitan Police have tested a system that analyses a person's criminal history and posts on social media to assess how likely it is for them to commit a crime. The 20-week pilot study, which is the first of its kind in the UK, combined data from different crime reporting and crime intelligence systems used by the Met. London's Metropolitan Police has tested a system that analyses a person's criminal history and posts on social media to assess how likely it is for them to commit a crime . 'You've got limited police resources and you need to target them efficiently,' Muz Janoowalla, head of public safety analytics at Accenture told the BBC. 'What this does is tell you who are the highest risk individuals that you should target your limited resources against.' The technology echoes the system used in the film Minority Report which predicted who would commit crimes and stopped them before the crime takes place. Developed by global consulting group, Accenture, the latest software helped police analyse intelligence about known gang members across London's 32 boroughs across a four year period. The software helped police analyse intelligence about known gang members across London's 32 boroughs across a four year period. It was able to analyse social media posts, such as the image above, posted by a London gang who stole a fleet of expensive, high-performance cars last year . Police then compared the software's results to known acts of violence that took place in the fifth year to find out its accuracy. Mr Janoowalla said the Met were hoping to identify groups of gang members that were at the highest risk of reoffending rather than focusing on specific individuals. However, he was would not disclose the exact criteria on which the gang members were scored. Privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch has asked for more information to be made public about how the data will be used. 'The police need to be very careful about how they use this kind of technology,' said research director Daniel Nesbitt. When police in Minority Report predicted who would commit crimes , it was considered so futuristic, the film was set in 2054 . When police in Minority Report predicted who would commit crimes and stopped them before they did it, it was considered so futuristic, the film was set in 2054. But last year, law enforcers in two American states used crime-prediction software to predict which freed prisoners are most likely to commit murder, and supervised them accordingly. Instead of relying on parole officers to decide how much supervision inmates will need on the outside by looking at their records, the new system used a computer algorithm to decide for them. The Minority Report-style software is already being used in Baltimore and Philadelphia to predict future murderers. It has been developed by Professor Richard Berk, a criminologist at the University of Pennsylvania, who believes it will reduce the murder rate and those of other crimes. Professor Berk says his algorithm could be used to help set bail amounts and also decide sentences in the future. It could also be modified to predict lesser crimes. 'Big data solutions such as this can run the risk of unfairly targeting certain groups of people and potentially making them feel stigmatised as a result.' Accenture has carried out other crime-prevention analysis elsewhere. For example, in Santa Cruz, California, police have applied the group's predictive analytics to their theft data. This, it claims, has helped them identify the streets at greatest risk resulting in a 19 per cent drop in property theft without the need for more officers. In Singapore, authorities are undertaking a 'Safe City' program that combines electronic vision technologies and predictive analytics into CCTV video feeds to detect street incidents.

82519,"Defence officials have secretly started examining plans to move Britain’s nuclear-armed submarines from Scotland to Wales, the Daily Mail can reveal. The Scottish Nationalists, on course for an unprecedented breakthrough at May’s General Election, insist they want the Trident fleet removed from its base on the west coast of Scotland. David Cameron refused to allow any contingency planning for Scottish independence to take place before last September’s referendum, not wanting to give the impression that the UK Government was even contemplating defeat. Scroll down for video . As polls revealed the SNP may have the power of king-maker after the general election, Parliament has begun drawing up plans to move the nuclear deterrent to Wales (pictured, HMS Vanguard at the Faslane base) But now, despite the ‘no’ vote in the referendum, pollsters say the SNP is on course to win dozens of Commons seats and may hold the balance of power at Westminster after the Election. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s new First Minister, has made scrapping Trident a condition of entering any sort of power-sharing deal with Labour. The Ministry of Defence insists it has no intention of moving the nuclear deterrent from the Faslane naval base on the River Clyde and is committed to maintaining a continuous, submarine-based missile system to protect the UK. But sources have disclosed that work has now begun on the practicalities of shifting Britain’s nuclear defence systems to Pembrokeshire, should that prove necessary. Labour’s First Minister in Wales, Carwyn Jones, is understood to have indicated he would be prepared to see Trident relocated to Milford Haven, a natural deep water port. Britain has four Royal Navy Vanguard submarines, based at Faslane, which can deploy Trident ballistic missiles carrying nuclear warheads. One well-placed source said political leaders in Wales were keen for the Ministry of Defence to ‘look at Welsh sites – not just Milford Haven’. Nicola Sturgeon (right) said scrapping trident would be a condition of a power-sharing deal with Labour, while Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones is understood to have volunteered Milford Haven as a replacement . The source said it would be negligent not to prepare for all contingencies, given the SNP surge in Scotland and the possibility of the party holding the balance of power. Mr Cameron said this week that the prospect of a Labour government being ‘held hostage’ by Scotland’s former First Minister Alex Salmond, who is running for a Westminster seat, was ‘genuinely frightening’. Ed Miliband has been forced to restate his commitment to replacing Britain’s nuclear weapons, after failing to vote against an SNP Commons motion calling for Trident to be scrapped last week. The Labour leader’s spokesman said: ‘Our position on Trident is clear and unchanged. 'Labour believes Britain should be leading international efforts for multilateral nuclear disarmament while maintaining a minimum, credible independent nuclear deterrent.’ However, one pro-nuclear Labour MP accused Mr Miliband of ‘trying to be cute’, adding: ‘He wants to carve a different position to that of the Tories but it’s a dangerous game.’ The SNP yesterday welcomed a YouGov poll showing that, when ‘don’t knows’ are removed, 53 per cent of people in Scotland agree that the UK should give up nuclear weapons. Across the UK, however, only 25 per cent of voters want Britain to give up Trident when it reaches the end of its useful life in 13 years. British fighter planes could return to Afghanistan to tackle the Taliban months after the last troops were withdrawn. Defence chiefs are examining plans to send a squadron of Tornados to bomb militants following a series of major Taliban attacks. A senior Whitehall source said: ‘We are looking at sending Tornados back.’ But resuming combat operations would be seen as an admission that Britain quit too soon after 13 years of fighting. Tornados could return to Afghanistan in the wake of several Taliban attacks, but resuming strikes would be seen as an admission that Britain quit too soon after 13 years in the country . As British soldiers pulled out late last year, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said they would not go back ‘under any circumstances’. But despite his confidence, 2014 was the deadliest year of the conflict, with the Afghans losing more than 4,500 men – more than Nato forces lost in 13 years. However, the country is still said to be three years away from having an air force. An MoD spokesman said: ‘We do not expect to send fighter jets to Afghanistan. There is nothing in train on this.’",SNP insist they want Trident fleet removed from base on west coast of Scotland. Pollsters say SNP on course to win dozens of Commons seats after election.

5808,"By . Hugo Gye . A Viking metal rod which left experts baffled for more than a century has finally been identified as a 'magic wand' used by a witch to cast spells. The staff, which was found in a ninth-century grave, is curved at the end - causing it to be misidentified as a fishing hook or a spit for roasting food. However, archaeologists have now concluded that it was in fact a magical item belonging to a sorceress who was 'on the margins of society'. Magical: This curved rod is believed to have been a staff belonging to a Viking sorceress in the 9th century . They suggest that the reason it was bent . before being buried with its owner was to remove its magical properties . - possibly to prevent the witch coming back from the dead. The 90cm-long rod has been part of the . British Museum's collection since 1894, when it was discovered in . Norway's Romsdal province. It had been buried next to a woman's body alongside other valuable items including an unusual plaque made of whalebone, implying that the person in the grave had a high status in Viking society. Its unusual shape, with a knobbly 'handle' and a hooked end, originally led historians to believe that it was a practical object used for catching fish. Outcast: A reconstruction of how Viking witches could have looked as they wielded their fearsome staffs . Power: Runes, seen carved on a standing stone, are thought to have had magical associations . Magical rituals are thought to have been central to many early medieval societies, but in most regions the advent of Christianity displaced them and obliterated all trace. However, Scandinavia was not converted to Christianity until the late 10th and early 11th centuries, meaning that we have much more historical and architectural evidence about their pagan beliefs. The magic apparently carried out by the owner of the British Museum staff is known as 'seithr', and was usually carried out by women sorceresses. It was used for both peaceful and aggressive purposes - some practitioners claimed to use their skills to predict the future, but others cast spells to curse their enemies. The runic alphabet, used to write Scandinavian languages before the coming of Christianity, is also thought to have had magical associations. Roman author Tacitus described how Germanic priests would write symbols on pieces of bark before casting them as lots to tell the future, while the great god Odin was said to have had special skills in rune-reading and divination. After Christianity came to the Norse world, traditional magic began to die out - but only after the old and new faiths went through a period of conflict. The 10th-century King Hakon of Norway was brought up a Christian, but after ascending to the throne he found himself pressured to take part in pagan rituals which involved eating horse liver at a pubic feast. They later decided that it was in fact a . skewer for roasting meat - but after comparing the rod with other . similar objects, experts have now reached a different conclusion. British Museum curator Sue Branning says that it was probably a magical staff used to perform 'seithr', a form of Viking sorcery predominantly practiced by women. 'Our rod fits with a number of these rods that turn up in the ninth and 10th century in female burials,' she told The Times. 'They normally take the form of these long iron rods with knobs attached to them.' The curve in the end of the staff is . likely to have signified that it was being put out of use, a common . practice in the medieval period for grave goods which were routinely . broken when they were buried. Bending . or breaking the buried possessions of the dead could have served to . neutralise their magical properties - preventing their former owners . from casting spells from beyond the grave. 'There . must have been some kind of ritual,' Ms Branning said. 'This object was . ritually ""killed"", an act that would have removed the power of this . object.' Although Viking society, like most . medieval societies, was dominated by men, some women were believed to . have special powers which made them influential figures. Ms . Branning said: 'These women were very well respected, but they were . quite feared as well. They may have been on the margins of society.' Because . the Vikings were not converted to Christianity until around 1000 AD, . there is strong evidence for the importance of magic in their society at . a time when the rest of Europe had largely abandoned the practice. Fierce: But women could be prominent figures in Viking society despite the common image of it as being dominated by warriors; medieval enthusiasts are pictured celebrating Hogmanay in Edinburgh this week . Display: The staff will be placed in a new gallery in the British Museum alongside other early medieval treasures such as this belt buckle from Sutton Hoo . Runes, the pre-Christian writing system used in Scandinavia and elsewhere, have long been thought to have had magical associations and were apparently used to tell the future. The witch's staff will go on display in the British Museum's new early medieval gallery, which is set to open on March 27. The room will also contain highlights of the museum's collections including the Anglo-Saxon treasures found at Sutton Hoo.",Metal rod was found in a grave in Norway's Romsdal province in the 9th century.

The Welsh government said funding would now be focused on training to prevent people who pose a risk from working with children and vulnerable adults.
Keith Dunn, chief executive of St John Ambulance Wales, said they now faced paying admin fees of ??5,000 a year.
Checks via the UK government's Disclosure and Barring Service - previously known as Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks - are free of charge for volunteers and organisations, and chargeable for paid employees.
But they have to be applied for through a registered body, which may charge an administration fee for the service.
WCVA, which has been funded by the Welsh government to do the work free of charge for charities in Wales since 2003, has written to charities explaining that its service would end on 31 May.
Mr Dunn estimated that another organisation may charge administration fees of ??5-??10 a time to carry out the checks, and called on ministers to think again.
""We are very concerned that a vital service in the vetting of potential volunteers wishing to join charities like St John is being cut,"" he said.
""This decision will affect every charity in Wales and is short sighted and potentially very harmful to the sector as a whole.""
Welsh Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have also criticised the funding decision which has led to the end of the WCVA service.
A Welsh government spokesperson said:  ""Circumstances have changed since the grant was introduced 12 years ago.
""In 2003, criminal record checks were expensive and difficult to access - today, such checks are free to volunteers and employers, and cost just ??13 a year for employed staff.
""We are not stopping our work and funding in this area - we are instead focusing on improving training and practices to ensure people who may pose a risk to children and vulnerable groups, do not work or volunteer in the sector.""
The spokesperson declined to comment on the question of extra administration fees charities might now face.",The head of one of Wales' most vulnerable charities has criticised the decision to cut the free criminal record checks it provides.

Colette Wilson, 48, from Otley, in West Yorkshire, stole £788,340 from IT solutions company Boxing Orange Limited in Leeds to pay for her extravagance. She was jailed for four years at Leeds Crown Court today after admitting theft through falsifying the company's accounts. A court heard how Wilson blew the company's cash on regular beauty treatments, an extension to her home in Pudsey, bought horses costing more than £50,000 and spent £71,000 on a horse arena. Wilson also spent thousands on designer clothing for herself and bought a Range Rover for £40,000 which she later part exchanged for a more expensive model. She also bought a car for her daughter and both enjoyed treatments at various salons. Scroll down for video . David Dixon, prosecuting, told Leeds Crown Court that her lavish living was financed by her dishonesty while employed as company secretary and financial controller for Boxing Orange Limited. She worked for the IT company for eight years in 'complete control of the finances', earning £37,000 a year, but her theft came to light in 2011 when the company was taken over by another firm, Accumuli PLC. An audit revealed that documents had been manipulated to hide her dishonesty. She initially tried to blame others and put the former company directors under suspicion, but enquiries revealed money had been paid into both her and her daughter's accounts. Wilson worked for IT company Boxing Orange Limited in Leeds for eight years, but her theft came to light in 2011 when the company was taken over by another firm, Accumuli PLC (pictured) It then emerged she had got the job in the first place in 2003 through the recommendation of a friend as honest and trustworthy, neither that person nor the directors were aware Wilson had previously been to jail for fraud. Mr Dixon told the court in 1997 she received 12 months in prison for dishonestly taking funds belonging to her then employers. When she was arrested by police in 2011 at her home in Pudsey, she claimed to think the money was rightfully hers because she had been one of the top employees. Inquiries into her finances showed a total of £44,000 had been paid to a builder for work on her home and for her daughter's 16th birthday party at the Crowne Plaza hotel in Leeds. Mr Dixon told the court: 'She had also spent £71,000 on a horse area. No expense was spared on the project. She bought horses including one for £20,000. Her total horse related purchases ran to £139,141. 'She also had an extension on her home at the price of £25,000. 'She became a customer at a shop called Rag Doll spending £100,000 on designer clothing and bought a variety of cars including a Range Rover.' Wilson spent £25,000 on her daughter's 16th birthday party at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Leeds (pictured) Mr Dixon said Wilson also spent the money on home interiors, cash and foreign currency and trips to salons with her daughter. She also spent  £25,000 on a birthday party for her daughter at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Leeds. Mr Dixon said she had repaid £119,000, but £668,347.50 remained outstanding. However, because she had now been declared bankrupt, no further money could be recovered. He said: 'Her criminal proceeds were used to fund a high lifestyle and seem in part to be because she believed herself more worthy than the company was paying her. This is a clear case of greed.' Gillian Batts, representing Wilson, said she was remorseful and realised she had let people down. She had not felt able to tell her family the details of what she had done. Wilson initially failed to turn up to court today, claiming she couldn't find anyone to look after her dogs, and so a warrant was issued for her arrest. Recorder Tim Gittins told her during sentencing: 'The face is what you gave with one hand you took surreptitiously with the other on a grand scale. 'It's clear from what I've seen from the forensic enquiries that it was spent on high living - nothing more and nothing less. 'You took an obscene amount of money to spent on your daughter's birthday party. No doubt she was delighted at the time but would be horrified to learn of your dishonesty. 'Following your conviction there will be publicity which means you will be shamed with all eyes on your family and friends.' The successful investigation was led by City of London Police, which takes the lead in many of the most high profile fraud cases.

The legendary winger, who signed his first professional contract on his 17th birthday in November, 1990, turned 40 last year and has increasingly been giving thought to whether he should continue playing for another season.

Moving on: Giggs is giving serious consideration to leaving Old Trafford and proving himself at another club . In a further stunning development, he is giving serious consideration to quitting his coaching role under manager David Moyes and leaving Old Trafford altogether at the end of this season. Such a move would send shock waves through Old Trafford after the one-club winger was drafted on to Moyes' coaching staff in what was seen as a step towards grooming him for a possible elevation to the manager's job in years to come. But Giggs is not only ready to end one of the most decorated playing careers in recent memory but make a clean break and continue his coaching badge away from United, in the hope of starting afresh and proving himself at another club. Old Trafford bosses are bracing themselves for a decision from Giggs, who made his debut as substitute for full-back Denis Irwin in a 2-0 home defeat to Everton on March 2, 1991 and went on to win every honour in the game.

Leon Quarless was arrested after he had been handing out £20 notes and Euros to other passengers on a flight from Palma, Majorca, to Blackpool . A drunk man who handed out money to fellow passengers on a flight from Majorca has lost nearly £5,000 which he had on him at the time. Police have claimed Leon Quarless, 46, who was arrested after his Jet2 flight from Palma, Majorca, touched down at its destination in Blackpool, Lancashire, had the money because he was involved in drug dealing. During the flight the pilot had radioed ahead and reported how Quarless had been drinking and then went up and down the aisle handing out £20 notes and Euros to other passengers. He was later fined in June last year £320 for being drunk on an aircraft. Now, a court has ruled police can keep the rest of the money which was found on him - a total of £4,972. Following his initial fine, Lancashire Police started a Proceeds of Crime Act into Quarless, from Formby, Merseyside, Blackpool Magistrates heard. Police financial investigator Alan Todd told how when Quarless was questioned about his money giveaway he suddenly removed a SIM card from his phone and put it in his mouth and crunched it up with his teeth. He was also found to be carrying a driving licence under the name Joseph Noone. The investigator told the court: 'This man does not appear to have a job. The Inland Revenue has never heard of him and has no records on him whatsoever. 'He has however boarded 50 flights in two years out of the UK mostly to Spain and Holland. '£70,000 in cash has gone through his various bank accounts during that time. 'Merseyside Police have intelligence that he may be involved in drugs and we believe this money has come about because of drug dealing.' Prosecutor Sue McLane said : 'It is fair to say that if this money we wish to seize came about legally he would have been banging on our doors to ask for it back.' Magistrates agreed to the seizure of the money found on Quarless which will now be going into a real charity fund run by the Chief Constable.

3957,"An investment banker found dead after trying to climb the Northeast's highest peak was using a broken emergency beacon and could have saved herself if she turned her cellphone on, rescuers have claimed. Kate Matrosova, 32, dropped off by her husband Charlie Farhoodi  at the base of New Hampshire's 5,400ft Mount Madison at 5am last Sunday. Within hours she had activated an emergency beacon amid but a team was unable to locate her in the blizzard because mountaineers say the sub-zero temperatures prevented it from working properly. Her body was discovered 24 hours later, with emergency responders being sent in the wrong direction by the faulty technology. Others have said it was 'negligent' for her to be up there and her decisions showed her 'inexperience'. Tragic: BNP Paribas credit trader Kate Matrosova, 32, was found dead 24 hours after she called for help as she hiked up Mount Madison . Married: Matrosova was dropped off at the range at 5am on Sunday by husband Charlie Farhoodi (left) who is listed on LinkedIn as the Vice President of JP Morgan. The couple shared a $1 million apartment in Manhattan . Emergency: A search team was unable to locate Matrosova (pictured in January) for 24 hours after her call . When she activated the tracking device, it triggered an instantaneous alert at Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City, Florida. Operators called the number associated with account, but it went straight to voicemail because her phone was switched off. It meant no one dialed 911 until her husband, who was sitting in his hotel room at the time, was contacted by staff at the Florida base. Volunteer mountain rescuer Steve Larson told the Boston Globe if they had Mastrova's correct location they would not have spent hours trekking through the woodland in the wrong direction. 'One lesson in all this, for all of this whiz-bang technology, it obviously is not spot-on,' he said. Fish and Game Lieutenant Wayne Saunders said her beacon was designed to function in temperatures as low as minus 20. But he said the air was far colder, meaning it could have tricked the technology. Mike Pelchat, a states park employee, added: 'Maybe she relied a little too much on the technology. Maybe she thought she could turn back. But the temperatures, and the wind, got the best of her.' Max Lurie, 28, who responded to the second Mountain Rescue Service call, told the Globe: 'It was cold — one of the coldest nights of the year — and the wind was howling. I don’t go up there when there are conditions like that. 'It was negligent for her to be up there. Her decision clearly speaks to her inexperience.' Grueling: Mt Madison (pictured, not with Matrosova) was hit by 100 mph winds and a blizzard on Sunday night . She had been attempting to climb the Presidential Range of the White Mountains - which includes the highest peak in the Northeast - Mount Washington - elevation 6,300 feet . Russia-born Matrosova, who lived in a $1 million apartment in Midtown Manhattan with Farhoodi, planned to climb to the top of  Madison before venturing across three other summits in the so-called Presidential Range, reports claim. As the day progressed, the region was hit by winds exceeding 100mph and temperatures plummeted to -30F. The BNP Paribas credit trader  sent her coordinates to rescuers on Sunday afternoon. After a failed attempt on Sunday, a National Guard crew flew over the area with a helicopter on Monday morning but couldn't see anything because of blowing snow and had to turn back. 'Unfortunately, a lot of the coordinates that we received over the night were all over the place within a mile circumference,' Fish and Game Lt. Jim Goss told WMUR-TV. Mount Madison is part of a series of summits named after presidents and other prominent Americans, which is collectively called the Presidential Range. She was found between Mt Madison and Mt Adams (top right), believed to have died from exposure to the cold . Plans: Authorities say Matrosova planned to climb all four peaks of the Presidential Range on her own . Matrosova, whose full name is Ekaterina, hailed from Omsk, Russia, before moving to Chicago to study in 2002 . Matrosova's Facebook showed her to be very active, with numerous images of hikes and white water rafting . According to WMUR-TV, Matrosova was going to venture through Mount Adams, Mount Jefferson and Mount Washington after reaching the top of Mount Madison. She found between Mount Madison and Mount Adams. A team made up of Fish and Game officers, Mountain Rescue Services members and Androscoggin Valley Search and Rescue members braved 108mph winds and frigid temperatures to reach the area. 'I guess if you are gonna hike in this type of weather you need to be in a more sheltered area, not up on an open exposed ridgeline,' Goss said. 'There's just no room for error in a place like that.' It is believed Matrosova, whose full name is Ekaterina Matrosova, hailed from Omsk in Russia before moving to Chicago to study in 2002. She completed a Bachelor of Science majoring in Finance and Marketing at Chicago's DePaul University in 2006. Matrosova's first job was with JP Morgan as a financial analyst, before moving to Beach Capital Management where she reached the role of Investment Adviser.

People manage their bank accounts, pay bills, trade stocks and generally transfer or store huge volumes of personal data online. Who is ultimately in charge of making sure all this information is secure: the government, the companies or the users? At a lively panel discussion at the annual Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday, computer security experts discussed the roll of the government in online security. The debate centered on whether the U.S. government should take the lead in setting security standards for the industry or whether companies are responsible for their own security and that of their users. ""I lose my cool when I hear people from the government say people from the private sector need to stand up. Providing for the common defense is what the government is supposed to do,"" said security systems expert Marcus Ranum. Four ways the Internet could go down . The U.S. government is considering various security bills that address online security standards. One controversial bill, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, would allow private companies to share data with government agencies when there is an attack or breach, without fear of lawsuits from customers over the shared data. However, several civil liberties groups believe the bill needs more restrictions on how the government can use that shared information. Creating laws isn't the only way the government can push for greater security. It can also use its significant financial sway on major companies. ""The government is an enormous purchasing agent in our industry. Why can't the NSA come up with a security standard that they like?"" asked Bruce Schneier, security critic and author. ""Let them go to the operating system companies, the database companies, the cloud providers, and say if you want the government business, you have to adhere to this."" Opponents of the government-control approach say corporations are responsible for their own security online, just as they would be for the physical security of their offices or property. Law enforcement is there to respond to incidents, not make sure the doors are properly locked, they contend. Homeland Security cites sharp rise in cyberattacks . Some of the enthusiasm for the government to take the initiative on cyberthreats is rooted in distrust of big Internet companies. At one point, Jennifer Granick, the director of civil liberties at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society, asked the large audience of security professionals who they trusted less, Google or the government? The majority raised their hands for Google. ""I fear Google more than I pretty much fear the government,"" said panelist Jeff Moss, the founder of Black Hat and DEF CON. ""Google, I'm contractually agreeing to give them all my data."" For now, mutual distrust between the government and the private sector is keeping the two sides from working together as effectively as possible, and the public could suffer because of it. ""The biggest risks right now are not the bad guys,"" said Schneier. ""They are the good guys who are not doing enough."" The users do have some responsibility to protect their data online, but the panelists agreed that regular people will usually bypass any extra steps, even if they are in their best interest, in the name of convenience.

Heist: The FBI is investigating $1.2million in cash found missing from a Swiss Air Lines jet when it at JFK airport, pictured, in New York Monday . The shipment on flight 17 left Zurich Saturday, but by the time it reached its destination at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, $1.2 million of the $92 million aboard was gone. The theft was discovered at the official count of the cash at its final destination in New Jersey. At first, it was it unclear if the money was stolen in Switzerland or somewhere en route. An investigation then uncovered a big hole had been punched in the crate, likely with a forklift. The thief then turned the crate in such a way that the hole wouldn't be evident.

25620,"Kevin Myers said he was ""very, very sorry"" for offending the broadcasters and said he was genuinely contrite.
Mr Myers, whom the paper has said it would not commission again, told Irish broadcaster RTÉ he had ""uttered those words out of respect for the religion"".
His article on BBC equal pay was in the paper's Irish edition and online.
He said it was ""over for him professionally"", adding that he was both the author of the article and his own misfortunes.
""I'm the master of my soul and I must answer for what I have done,"" he said in a radio interview with presenter Sean O'Rourke. ""I cannot blame anybody else.""
Mr Myers insisted he was neither anti-Semitic nor a misogynist.
""I've got serious professional flaws. I'm not sure that anyone is going to see those professional flaws in future, because I'm not sure I have a career in which to show them,"" he said.
One of his flaws was to deal with major issues in throwaway lines, he added.
""The throwaway line is so often my pitfall,"" he said, blaming his own ""stupidity"".
Asked if the Sunday Times was right to fire him, he replied: ""Yeah. I think so,"" although he felt that the manner in which the matter was handled could have been better.
Mr Myers said he had made an error of judgement. Since it happened, he said, he had not slept, had lost his livelihood and was ""in a very bad way"".
""I'm not sure if there is any redemption for me now which will give a lot of people satisfaction,"" he added.
Feltz described the article as ""so obviously racist it's surprisingly hurtful"".
The piece was taken down following anger on social media and a formal complaint from the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism to press regulator Ipso.
Mr Myers' column - entitled ""Sorry, ladies - equal pay has to be earned"" - was published last Sunday and centred on the BBC gender pay row.
Commenting that two of the best-paid presenters, Winkleman and Feltz, were Jewish, Mr Myers wrote: ""Good for them.
""Jews are not generally noted for their insistence on selling their talent for the lowest possible price, which is the most useful measure there is of inveterate, lost-with-all-hands stupidity.""
In the article, he also argued that male presenters might earn more because they ""work harder, get sick less frequently and seldom get pregnant"".
Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens said the piece should not have been published.
Frank Fitzgibbon, editor of the Sunday Times Ireland, said he took ""full responsibility"", adding: ""This newspaper abhors anti-Semitism and did not intend to cause offence to Jewish people.""
However, an Irish Jewish leader has defended Mr Myers.
Maurice Cohen, from the Jewish Representative Council of Ireland, said Mr Myers ""inadvertently stumbled into an anti-Semitic trope"".
""More than any other Irish journalist he has written columns about details of the Holocaust over the last three decades that would not otherwise have been known by a substantial Irish audience,"" he said.
""We, who have been reading Kevin's work over many years and those who know him personally, know that while this was a real error of judgement on his part, also know that he is not an anti-Semite.""",The Sunday Times has fired a presenter who wrote an anti-Semitic column about BBC equal pay.

The burden of high taxes and red tape is preventing Britain from creating enough globally successful entrepreneurs, according to a think-tank. Analysis by the Centre for Policy Studies found the UK does not even rank among the top 10 countries for producing billionaire entrepreneurs. Britain lags behind the likes of Hong Kong, the U.S., Australia, Canada and Ireland according to the study - although still performed better than the majority of eurozone countries, including Germany. In an article for The Daily Telegraph, the report's author Dr Nima Sanandaji urged the Government to cut capital gains tax and scrap the top 45p tax rate. He also criticised Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith for suggesting the Coalition's welfare reforms were encouraging more people to start successful businesses. Last week Mr Duncan Smith hailed Britain's 'entrepreneurial spirit' after the Bank of England highlighted figures showing a record 4.5 million people are self-employed. But Dr Sanandaji wrote: 'The Work and Pensions Secretary was conflating self-employment with entrepreneurship. In reality, the two phenomena are quite different.' 'The Coalition's benefit reforms may well promote self-employment, which is a good thing in itself. But it is wrong to suppose that reducing benefits will do much for entrepreneurship. 'In order to do that, the Coalition should turn its attention to cutting business and personal tax rates and taking the axe to red tape.'

29818,"In August 2011 he stood victorious inside Col Muammar Gaddafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound after fighters from his Tripoli Brigade broke through the defences of the ousted leader's fortress.
But the victory was a long time coming for the staunch anti-Gaddafi fighter, who spent seven years in the city's notorious Abu Selim prison, where he says he was regularly tortured.
He says he and his wife, Fatima Bouchar, were handed to the Gaddafi regime by the CIA after being arrested in Thailand and transported via UK-controlled Diego Garcia.
Now he is taking legal action against former British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw over claims that Mr Straw signed papers authorising the move.
It is thought to be the first time civil action of this kind has been taken against a former foreign secretary.
Mr Belhadj had fought against Col Gaddafi for many years and had been involved with an Islamist group's attempt to overthrow the Libyan leader in the late 1990s.
Libya spy papers 'show CIA links'
Mr Belhadj - known in the jihadi world as Abu Abdullah al-Sadiq - commanded the now defunct Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG).
The group was formed in 1990 by Islamist Libyans who had fought in Afghanistan against Soviet forces in the 1980s.
The LIFG waged a three-year low-level insurgency mainly based in eastern Libya, and staged three attempts to assassinate Col Gaddafi in 1995 and 1996, according to Middle East analyst Omar Ashour of Exeter University.
By 1998, the group was crushed. Most of its leaders fled to Afghanistan and joined forces with the Taliban. There, Mr Belhadj is alleged to have developed ""close relationships"" with al-Qaeda leaders and Taliban chief Mullah Omar, according to an arrest warrant issued by the Libyan government in 2002.
The warrant says that he was based in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, from where he ran and financed training camps for Arab mujahideen fighters.
It notes that he was born in 1966 in the Souq al-Jumaa area of Tripoli and studied at al-Fateh University, where press reports say he earned a civil engineering degree.
The warrant says Mr Belhadj travelled widely, spending time in Sudan, Pakistan, Syria and Iran. He is also said to have visited Turkey, London and Denmark.
After the 11 September attacks and the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, he and most of the LIFG leaders fled that country as well, only for Mr Belhadj to be arrested in 2004 in Thailand by the CIA and then handed over to Col Gaddafi's government.
Mr Belhadj spent time in the Abu Selim Prison, before being freed in 2010 under a ""de-radicalisation"" drive championed by Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the Libyan leader.
His latest incarnation as the top Libyan rebel commander, widely credited with chasing the Gaddafi family out of Tripoli, has propelled him to international attention - along with his account of being tortured under the controversial CIA interrogation programme known as rendition.
Files unearthed from Col Gaddafi's intelligence archives and seen by the BBC documented Mr Belhadj's capture by the CIA in Bangkok in 2004, and his forcible repatriation to Libya.
Peter Bouckaert, a spokesman for Human Rights Watch - which originally obtained the documents - explained the circumstances of Mr Belhadj's transfer.
""He was rendered by the CIA, he was captured, abducted together with his pregnant wife and flown on the so-called black flight to Tripoli for his interrogation,"" he said.
Mr Bouckaert said Mr Belhadj was one of about eight or nine suspects who were abducted and handed over to the Libyan intelligence service.
""From the files it's very clear [CIA agents] were present in some of the interrogations themselves.""
In Abu Selim prison, Mr Belhadj told the Guardian newspaper, ""I was injected with something, hung from a wall by my arms and legs and put in a container surrounded by ice. They did not let me sleep and there was noise all the time.""
Mr Belhadj told the BBC that after the CIA and Britain's MI6 intelligence agency got him to Tripoli in March 2004, they did not witness his torture, but interrogated him afterwards.
""What happened to me was illegal and deserves an apology,"" he told the BBC's Jeremy Bowen in Tripoli.
In March, the BBC revealed the UK government had authorised the rendition of Mr Belhadj and his wife, though it was not clear at what level. And on 15 April the Sunday Times published an article quoting sources alleging the authorisation had come from Mr Straw.
Mr Belhadj and his wife are seeking damages from the former minister for the trauma they say they suffered.
Papers have also been issued in the High Court to sue the UK government, its security forces and senior M16 officer Sir Mark Allen for damages in the case.
UK ministers have denied any complicity in rendition or torture. Mr Straw says he cannot comment on the claims because of an ongoing police investigation into the UK's alleged role in rendition.
The CIA has previously said it should come as no surprise that the US worked with foreign governments to help protect America from terrorists.
Moderate tone
When the rendition claims first surfaced after the fall of the Gaddafi regime, Mr Belhadj said they would not stop Libya's new rebel leadership - the National Transitional Council - from having ""orderly relations"" with the US and Britain.
The NTC has dismissed any suggestions that Abdel Hakim Belhadj is a former al-Qaeda sympathiser, following reports in the international media as well as statements attributed to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi himself.
""NTC members have stated time and again that the revolution has no links to al-Qaeda,"" said NTC spokesman Al-Amin Belhadj told al-Jazeera Television last year.
""Everyone knows who Abdel Hakim Belhadj is. He is a Libyan rebel and a moderate person who commands wide respect. Unfortunately, some circles in the West repeat these claims,"" he added.
Asked about his Islamist links, Mr Belhadj told the BBC that he was always an anti-Gaddafi fighter, but insisted that he was never an al-Qaeda member.
He is contesting the 7 July elections as a candidate of the Al-Watan (Homeland) Party in a Tripoli constituency.","Abdel Hakim Belhadj, a former Libyan rebel leader, is taking legal action against the UK over claims he was tortured under the so-called rendition programme."
50214,"Crab and lobster catchers in north Norfolk have agreed a compensation deal with Dong Energy, which is planning to build 91 turbines off the coast.
Boats have been excluded from the Race Bank site since February.
Dong said boats may be allowed in for two months in January and full-time when construction is finished in 2018.
Fishing boats were involved in a dispute with the Danish energy company over proposals to pay Â£220-a-day per boat for loss of income.
An agreement was reached over payments although neither side would reveal the size of the new offer.
Nicky King, chairman of Wells and District Inshore Fishermen's Association, said: ""However, it doesn't look like we'll be able to go back there for another three years and, although there's the possibility of being allowed back for a couple of months next year, we're not hopeful because we were told that could happen this year and it hasn't.
""Personally I feel the compensation won't quite make up for the loss of income, but it's impossible to quantify precisely because catches are unpredictable and weather-dependent.""
The energy firm said construction would mean the 75 sq km (29 sq miles) exclusion zone had to remain in place.
A Dong Energy spokesman said: ""Where and when it is safe to do so in relation to the ongoing preparatory and construction works, some areas could be reopened for certain types of fishing activities.
""The zone may be reopened to fishing for a period of around two months starting in January.
""Although all future closure/reopening dates will remain subject to short-term alteration, Dong Energy will keep affected fishermen up-to-date via the regular issue of Notices to Fishermen.""",Fishing boats may be allowed back into the Race Bank site after a dispute over compensation.

44528,"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Colorado woman walked down the aisle on Saturday in a wedding that almost didn't happen after the bride and her maid of honor were forced to jump from the third floor of their apartment after the building caught fire just five days before she was scheduled to tie the knot. Lenise Brown and best friend Marilyn Kruc survived the massive blaze at their Copper Terrace Apartment complex in Centennial - just south of Denver - but Kruc broke her back while jumping from the apartment, and neither woman knew whether she'd be able to stand by her friend's side as she said her vows until the morning of the wedding. Wearing a back brace, Kruc was by her best friend's side during Saturday's ceremony. Lucky: Bride Lenise Brown is walked down the aisle by her father, Greg Ruff, just days after she survived a fire by jumping from her third floor apartment . Destroyed: The massive blaze completely destroyed several units in the apartment building where Brown lived with her best friend Marilyn Kruc . 'I would consider her my sister.  I just have brothers so she’s the . closest thing I have to a sister and I’m just so proud of her for her . courage and her strength,' Brown tells 7News Denver. 'For her [to make] that trip, I know it was . hard, it means a lot to us.' Luckily, Brown only suffered burns to her hands and face, but nothing serious enough to keep her from marrying her now-husband, Sam Brown. 'It’s been the craziest montage of everything, it’s been really hard and . it’s been stressful but we’re here and Marilyn made it and we’re . married,' Sam Brown said. The fire broke out in the apartment building about 1 a.m. on June 23. Within minutes, firefighters were on the scene battling the enormous flames and trying to rescue people trying to get out of the building. Lucky: Brown only suffered minor burns to her face and arms during her escape from the massive blaze . Maid of honor: Kruc attended the wedding and walked down the aisle with the help of a walker and back brace . By the time the fire was under control, eight people had been injured by either the flames or from jumping from the building. The roof and several apartments were completely gutted by the inferno, which authorities are now investigating as possible arson. Eight of the apartment in the 24-unit building were completely destroyed, while ten others suffered smoke and water damage, Becky O'Guin, a spokeswoman with South Metro Fire Rescue Authority, told the Denver Post. Of the injuries, Kruc's was the most serious - she suffered two broken vertebrae in her lower back and underwent surgery hours after the fire. Both women were terrified. Happily married: Both Brown and her husband, Sam Brown, were honored that Kruc made it to the wedding after breaking her back just days earlier . Arson: Detectives are investigating the fire - that injured 8 and destroyed much of the building - as possible arson . 'I just am glad I was with her in this moment because if we were to die, . I was with my best friend,' Lenise Brown told 7NEWS shortly after the blaze. The father of the bride, Greg Ruff, was happy to give his daughter away following the near-tragic incident.

48373,"Places on many school sixth form or college courses depend on achieving minimum grades at GCSE - so if your marks did not meet expectations, getting good advice is crucial.
Catherine Sezen of the Association of Colleges is on hand to give advice on what to do following unexpected results.
YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED
My son only got three C grades and all the rest  of his GCSEs were Ds. The school he has been attending for the last five years have said that, as he only got three good GCSE's and they require at least five for sixth form, they cannot offer him a place to stay on. Where do we stand as he really wanted to stay there for sixth form? Catherine
Hi Catherine
I am sorry to hear that your son didn't quite achieve the grades that he wanted, but I am sure with there will be a course for him, perhaps at a different school or college.
All schools and colleges have entry requirements which ‎they need to apply consistently to all applicants.
If your son wants to stay at the same school it is worth asking if they have another option for him there. I would also suggest contacting your local FE college to discuss what they might be able to offer. College based vocational or technical courses have good career progression opportunities - or they might suggest an apprenticeship.
If your son is worried about moving to a different school or college it would be good to find out why. All schools and colleges will have induction programmes to help students settle in and make friends.
Catherine
I've missed a large amount of my secondary education (almost 3 years) due to mental health issues and although it was a struggle, I managed to achieve 4 A*s, 1 A, 2 Bs, 1 C and a D. Unfortunately this D was in drama, the subject I want to focus on in college, and although the college didn't need any specific drama grade on entry (only an English grade at C or above and I achieved A*s in both literature and language) I can't help but feel this might affect my chances. Any advice? Kat
Hi Kat,
Well done on your GCSE results. You have done really well to achieve such good grades. The college would be best placed to advise on your drama grade though, if the entry requirements specified English grades (which you have exceeded), I don't think there will be a problem.

First of all congratulations on an excellent set of results - well done! Each university will have its own entry requirements for medicine as for all subjects.
I would suggest that your GCSE results would indicate that you have a very realistic opportunity to go on and be successful in your chosen field, but if you have a particular course or university in mind you could look at their entry requirements online to check what they would be looking for.
Good luck with your further studies,
Catherine
I am disappointed with my results. I think exams are unfair because some people are unlucky when they take exams. I received an A for media studies - but because I only got a C in English language I am told I'm not allowed to take it at A-level.
I was also told I could not take psychology, a totally new subject to me, because I have not got Bs in English and maths.
Shouldn't people's work ethic be taken into account more when it comes to what courses they can apply for next and shouldn't coursework be a large part of the courses to make it fairer?
Danny
Hi Danny
Well done on getting the A grade for media studies.  I would see this as an opportunity to think hard about your next steps. Why don't you contact your school and local further education college to see what options are available to you with the grades that you have achieved?
BTEC courses for example include more coursework and still provide excellent opportunities for progression into work or to higher education.
I am sure you will find a course which suits you and your career aspirations.

My son received GCSE D grades English and maths but has already started working on an apprenticeship scheme which is full time, five days a week.
I understand that if grade A-C is not achieved in English and maths then it is the law that the child must continue in education until they are 18 to try and achieve grade A*-C. Is this true in all cases such as if they are on an apprenticeship which isn't offering day release?
I am delighted to hear that your son has secured an apprenticeship. If he has achieved Ds in English and maths I think that he will need to continue studying these subjects as part of his apprenticeship. I would suggest that you contact his apprenticeship provider to check whether this will mean retaking GCSE or taking Functional Skills qualifications in English and maths which are more work related.

My son is normally an A student bordering on A*. He just received his GCSE results and is heartbroken. He spent many hours studying and he got just one A in maths and Bs in every other subject. His lowest percentage was 72 so why did he fail to get As across the broad?
Hi Leon
First of all congratulations to your son that he has done so well in passing all his GCSEs. I appreciate, however, that he may feel disappointed if he was anticipating higher grades in many of his subjects.
I would suggest in the first instance that you contact his school to get their view on his grades. It may be that they will suggest a re-marking for some of his papers.
However, with the grades that he has got, your son should be able to get on to the course of his choice at school or college.
I wish him well in his future studies.
Catherine
My son did not get the required grade A in his AQA biology - he got a B. What are his options with this result? I am not sure what to do really.
Lynd
Hi Lynd,
It sounds as if your son may well have achieved the grades he needed in his other subjects, which is great and congratulations to him.
I would suggest contacting the school to discuss his biology grade. If he was close to the required A grade you could ask for a review of marking for that subject.
The school may also consider allowing him to take the A-level and monitor his progress over the first few weeks. However, do bear in mind that there may be other young people in the same situation and the school will need to be consistent in their approach.
Catherine
My son has achieved grade C in GCSE science. His mark equivalent is 273. He got 87A in practical and in the papers he got 98C and 88C.
I want to know please where a grade B will start from as he was predicted a B and I'm wondering whether to appeal this result if it's really close to a B grade.
Nasima
Hi Nasima
I would suggest contacting his school to ask whether they think a review of results would be a good idea.  They will have an overview of his results and his work throughout the year and would be best placed to advise on a re-mark.
Good luck to your son in his future plans.

A second-half goal from Marc McNulty proved enough to put the Sky Bet League One side through, and inflict a fifth straight defeat on the Saints. Afterwards, manager Ronald Koeman accused Blades boss Nigel Clough of showing a lack of respect, with words exchanged on the benches following the goal and United's first-team coach Chris Morgan sent to the stands before the Dutchman then refused to shake hands at the final whistle.

Portuguese defender Fonte insists the players must shoulder their share of the responsibility for what was a below-par performance on a damp night in South Yorkshire. 'It was not acceptable. I would firstly like to apologise to the fans, they didn't deserve this. That is not us,' Fonte told Southampton's official YouTube channel. 'Given the last games we have lost, we played and we showed that we are better than the opposition and we had the opportunities to win and deserved more from the games. 'But after Tuesday night, I am disappointed obviously and I am angry because we had a great opportunity to go and do something special and we just blew it.

It is an opportunity lost, but there is still a long season ahead.' Southampton - who lost at Burnley last weekend, following successive defeats by Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United - will look to get their campaign back on track at home to Everton on Saturday. Fonte believes Saints must stick to their slick passing style which helped take them up to second place in the Barclays Premier League earlier in the season. Saints boss Ronald Koeman (centre back) had a bust-up with Blades manager Nigel Clough (front) 'Especially after the first goal we started going long and with all due respect, we are not a long ball team. For the last five years we've been playing football,' the defender said. 'We've opened teams up with one-twos, crosses in the box, playing out of defence, and we changed everything and I don't understand why. 'We've spoke about it and we need to take responsibility, come and get the ball, do what we do, play the way we normally play and that's the way we believe we can win. We didn't do that.

45169,"The 111 service, replacing NHS Direct, is being piloted in many regions but has proved problematic, with some callers left on hold for hours.
Dr Laurence Buckman, the British Medical Association's GP committee chair, says wider rollout should be stalled.
The Department of Health says it is giving some areas extra time.
It has already sanctioned an extension of up to six months of the original 1 April 2013 deadline for regions struggling to set up the new service.
The NHS Direct 0845 4647 service will continue to be available to callers in areas where the NHS 111 service is not yet available, Health Minister Lord Howe insists.
These include: North of Tyne and Tees, North Essex, Bedfordshire and Luton, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, Leicestershire and Rutland, Berkshire, Cornwall and Devon.
But the British Medical Association is concerned that many of the places that are already offering the new service or that are due to launch soon are ill-prepared, putting patients' lives at risk.
The BMA says it has been receiving widespread reports of NHS 111 failures
Some of the pilot regions have been unable to cope with call volumes or have suffered catastrophic IT failures.
In Greater Manchester the entire system crashed, meaning calls went unanswered.
One elderly patient had to wait 90 minutes for a call back from NHS 111.
Problems led to a surge in ambulance callouts and casualty visits as callers have resorted to other measures to get seen by a healthcare professional.
Dr Buckman said: ""The BMA is seriously concerned that these failures are not only having impact on other, already overstretched NHS services, but potentially putting patient safety at risk. Patients need to have their calls answered immediately and correctly and not be faced with any form of delay.
""The Department of Health needs to reconsider immediately its launch of NHS 111 which clearly is not functioning properly. They must ensure that the system is safe for patients before it is rolled out any further.""
Lord Howe said: ""NHS 111 will help patients access the whole of the NHS through just one simple number.
""Over the coming months this new service will replace the existing NHS Direct telephone advice line. To ensure that patients get the best care and treatment, we are giving some areas more time to go live with NHS 111 while we carry out thorough testing to ensure that those services are reliable.""","The launch of a new NHS telephone advice line has been delayed by more than a year, the British Medical Association has warned."

A ‘suicide club’ that provides advice and equipment to help people kill themselves has been set up in Britain. Exit International, which campaigns to legalise euthanasia, has opened a London office to ‘cope with demand’ after its UK membership hit 1,000. The group, which charges members a fee to access online information and attend workshops to discuss ‘peaceful’ methods of suicide, has attracted fierce criticism in Australia, where it was originally set up.

21182,"Celia Service, 72, from Colwyn Bay, was hit after a Jaguar XF mounted the pavement in Rhos on Sea in April 2012.
No charges were brought against driver Geoffrey Read, who was 90 at the time.
Police reviewed the case after Mrs Service's family hired a private investigator. But the Crown Prosecution Service is not taking the case further.
Mr Read told police that he had ""blacked out"" at the time his car mounted the pavement and hit a shop - a collision which also left Mrs Service's daughter, Helen, seriously injured.
When no charges were brought against him, Mrs Service's family hired a private investigator who presented new evidence to the police.
North Wales Police agreed to review the case in spring 2015.
But in a letter sent to the family, the CPS said there was still ""insufficient evidence for there to be a realistic prospect of obtaining a conviction"".
Crown Prosecutor Andrew Fouracre said: ""In my assessment, it is highly possible that Mr Read suffered a loss of consciousness prior to the collision.
""Equally, it is entirely possible that the collision occurred because he became distracted and/or paid insufficient attention to the road.
""However, based on the available material, there is no evidence upon which the prosecution can rely to prove the latter scenario over that of the former.""
The family said they will be asking for a review of the decision, and have criticised the police investigations both at the time and more recently.
Mrs Service's husband, David said: ""This is a disgusting, disgraceful and quite frankly immoral decision by the CPS.
""Our sweetest, beloved, wise and gentle Ci, Celia Mary Service, was everything that is of beauty in this world.
""As a family we have been devastated.""
Ch Insp Darren Wareing, of North Wales Police, said: ""Though time consuming because of the complexities of the investigation North Wales Police felt the depth of the investigation important to ensure that a fully informed decision could be taken by the CPS.
""A full and highly detailed file of evidence was presented to the CPS and they have now taken a decision in that regard.""","The family of a woman who was seriously injured when her car crashed into a shop have said they are ""devastated"" by the decision by North Wales Police not to prosecute her."

72251,"He's the robot boy who fights evil with his superhuman strength and now the Australian company behind The Lego Movie is set to make a live-action superhero film based on the popular cartoon character Astro Boy. With production of the second and third Lego spin-off's set to start later this year in Sydney, animation company Animal Logic has signed on to reinterpret the classic Japanese manga series Astro Boy and producer Zareh Nalbandian has promised they will not disappoint. Having sold over 100 million manga copies worldwide, Astro Boy is the kind of film an animation producer dreams of and for Nalbandian it's a chance for him to bring a beloved and iconic character to life. He's the robot boy who fights evil with his superhuman strength and now the Australian company behind The Lego Movie is set to make a live-action superhero film based on the popular cartoon character Astro Boy . 'It is a big challenge but it’s also really exciting. It’s the kind of thing you dream of as a film-maker to be able to bring such a beloved and iconic character to life but in a way that’s never been done before,' Nalbandian told Daily Mail Australia. Astro Boy, known in Japan as 'Mighty Atom' was created by Osamu Tezuka, who is considered the Japanese equivalent of Walt Disney. The boy with the supernatural powers first appeared as a cartoon series from 1951 to 1968, set in a time where Japan was recovering from the atomic blasts during World War II. Astro Boy went on to become one of the most-loved cartoon characters ever created. Since his emergence, Astro Boy has been made into a TV animation series twice. He was also turned into feature length animation in Hollywood in 2009. Using his superpowers, including strength, jet flight, adjustable hearing and instant language translation, the cartoon character fights evil while possessing the kindness of a child. With production of the second and third Lego spin-off's set to start later this year in Sydney, animation company Animal Logic has signed on to reinterpret the classic Japanese manga series Astro Boy and producer Zareh Nalbandian (pictured) has promised they will not disappoint . Producer Nalbandian admits that there will be high expectations for the film from avid cartoon audiences, but believes he has the opportunity to make Astro Boy as big a success as Iron Man or Guardians of the Galaxy. 'We have high expectations. We won’t make a mediocre movie, this is a once in a generation opportunity to reinterpret Astro Boy for a 21st century audience,' Nalbandian said. 'Ultimately we've got the passion and we have the commitment but we need to partner with great writers and great film-makers and I think that right combination will empower us to do what we want to do.' Nalbandian's impressive career spans over decades with films such as Walking with Dinosaurs 3D and Happy Feet under his belt. He knows what it takes to reinterpret a classic icon and bring him to the big screen and believes Astro Boy needs to be taken into the 21st Century to be a success. The producer believes we are living in 'an exciting time' in film for the convergence of life-action, animation and visual effects and says anything is possible. Nalbandian produced The Lego Movie last year . It was a huge shock for Animal Logic that The Lego Movie wasn't nominated for an Oscar this year . 'We can’t stick to the TV series and we’re certainly not going to be referencing the 2009 animated movie. We really want us to reinterpret him in a very contemporary way.' 'If you look at Legend of the Guardians and more recently Lego and before that Walking with Dinosaurs or the Great Gatsby movie they're all very different but they all have one thing in common which is they break new ground,' he said, . This will be the fist time Astro Boy will have ever been made into a Hollywood blockbuster film. Japan's Tezuka Productions have been very careful about who they let lay their hands on their prized possession. 'They wanted to make sure that whoever did it would do justice to the property,' Nalbandian said. Happy Feet won an Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year in 2007 . Nalbandian produced and worked on visual effects for the widely acclaimed film . 'There has been an explosion in this type of film in the last half a decade particularly and I think it’s a great time to bring him to the big screen as a live action superhero. 'Whether it’s Spiderman or Iron Man or Guardians of the Galaxy there is just such a love from audiences for this type of property so the timing is perfect.' he said. Nalbandian and Animal Logic are in the pre-production stages of the next instalment of the Lego movies. The first one will be called Lego Ninjago, based on a Lego toy line and the second film will go by the name Lego Batman, to be directed by Chris McKay who co-directed the first film. The company is also working on a Betty Boop movie, in collaboration with Simon Cowell's Syco Entertainment. 'They’re both (Lego movies) being produced out of Animal Logic in Sydney which is very exciting because it means that the people who worked on the first film will be able to continue to do great work on the second and third,' Nalbandian said. Nalbandian produced Walking with Dinosaurs 3D in 2013 . The animation film depicted what it was like when dinosaurs walked the earth . 'It really supports out animation industry in Australia and it supports long-term creative jobs so it’s not just about the films it’s about the industry as well. We’re really pleased it solidifies the position we’re in in Australia.' in 2006, Nalbandian's work on Happy Feet contributed to the monumental Oscar win for the penguin film. However, he says he is 'perplexed' that The Lego Movie wasn't even nominated for an Oscar nod this year. 'I feel perplexed and disappointed and that’s being really honest,' Nalbandian said. 'If you look at the amount of news that was generated when the Oscars were announced there was more news generated around why Lego didn't get a nomination than any other nomination actually announced so we weren't the only ones perplexed.' Zareh Nalbandian worked on visual effects for The Great Gatsby. The film won over critics and was hailed a success . Baz Lurhman worked with Nalbandian on the film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan were the stars . From Nalbandian's point of view, The Lego Movie was 'the most ground-breaking and most challenging animated film that was produced last year'. 'It found the biggest audience in America of any animated film produced last year so all I can think is the Academy maybe was a little bit unsure because it was a toy brand. Perhaps they didn't understand the complexity of the film because we made it look too easy.' Nalbandian said the Academy like to hold on to traditional methods of film making and believes there are not enough categories at the awards for animation movies. 'There’s not enough slots because if the Academy wants to keep supporting traditional animation and recognise innovative animation and animated story-telling, perhaps five slots is not enough. The funny thing the only bad review we had about Lego was someone actually said that they got sick of laughing so hard in the first 20 minutes.'",Astro Boy will be a live-action superhero film made by Australian company Animal Logic. Production of the second and third Lego spin-off's is set to start later this year in Sydney. Producer Zareh Nalbandian believes Astro Boy needs to be taken into the 21st Century to be a success. Nalbandian worked on visual effects for The Great Gatsby and Walking with Dinosaurs 3D.
64988,"A series of stunning images have been released showing Rosetta’s comet in unprecedented detail, revealing cracks on the surface, evidence of ice, steep cliffs and more. The snaps of 67P Churyumov/Gerasimenko accompanied yesterday’s release of several scientific papers detailing new discoveries and observations of the comet. Scientists around will continue poring through data from Rosetta as the comet prepares to make its closest approach to the sun in August this year, when it is expected to become considerably more active than it is now. Scroll down for video . US and European scientists have revealed amazing new images of comet 67P Churyumov/Gerasimenko. Shown here is the boulder-strewn, smooth Hapi region in Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko’s neck, with the Hathor cliff face to the right . The pictures were analysed by various US and European scientists, revealing previously unknown characteristics of the comet. Yesterday the shape, evolution and lifespan of comet 67P-Churyumov/Gerasimenko were revealed in a series of groundbreaking papers in the journal Science. Using data from Rosetta, scientists revealed that the comet’s interior is ‘fluffy’. Among the other discoveries they found that the comet's neck may have been 'eaten away' over time, rather than being the result of two smaller bodies merging together. From the data, Dr Holger Sierks from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research told MailOnline that they now had a greater understanding of the comet's interior. He said the interior is now thought to be analogous to 'ash, cigarette ash or super-dry powder snow.' Many of the images were returned by the Osiris (Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System) camera on the Rosetta spacecraft, which has imaged 70 percent of the comet’s surface to date. The remaining 30 per cent will remain unseen and shrouded in darkness until the comet makes its closest approach to the sun in August. ‘Rosetta is essentially living with the comet as it moves towards the sun along its orbit, learning how its behaviour changes on a daily basis and, over longer timescales, how its activity increases, how its surface may evolve, and how it interacts with the solar wind,’ said Esa Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor. ‘We have already learned a lot in the few months we have been alongside the comet, but as more and more data are collected and analysed from this close study of the comet we hope to answer many key questions about its origin and evolution.’ From the images and data, five basic - but diverse - categories of terrain type have been determined: dust-covered; brittle materials with pits and circular structures; large-scale depressions; smooth terrains; and more ‘rock-like’ surfaces. Much of the comet also appears to be covered in dust, as a result of dust that is dragged along by the comet falling to the surface over time. This dust is also thought to be insulating the comet, based on data from the Microwave Instrument on the Rosetta Orbiter (Miro). This could play a key role in helping to protect ice thought to exist below the surface. Small patches of ice have even been spotted on the surface. Here, a section of the smaller of Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko’s two lobes is seen through Rosetta’s narrow-angle camera from a distance of about five miles (8km) to the surface on 14 October 2014 . This is a summary of properties of the comet, as determined by Rosetta’s instruments during the first few months of its comet encounter. The full range of values are presented and discussed in a series of papers published in the 23 January 2015 issue of the journal Science . Shown is an active pit detected in the Seth region of the comet. This is an Osiris narrow-angle camera image acquired on 28 August 2014 at a distance of 37 miles (60km) from the comet. The image resolution is 3.3 feet (one metre) per pixel . Surface textures on the border of the broad, smooth region in Imhotep, on the large lobe of the comet, are seen here . On a larger scale, the images also revealed the huge exposed cliff walls on the comet, which are covered in randomly oriented fractures. Their formation is likely due to the rapid heating-cooling cycles experience by the comet’s 12.4-hour ‘day’, during which different parts of the surface are subjected to sunlight. One prominent and intriguing feature is a 1,640ft (500m) long crack seen roughly parallel to the neck of the comet, running between its two larger lobes at either end. Steep regions of the exposed cliff faces have also revealed features known as ‘goosebumps’, small lumpy areas, but their origin is not yet known. Are these icy alcoves? The colour composite on the left shows material 20 per cent brighter and bluer than the surrounding area (at A and B), which may be evidence of exposed ice. On the right, bright, highly reflective metre-sized boulders (C) and fracturing (D) are seen . This Osiris image was acquired on 22 November 2014 from a distance of 19 miles (30km) from the comet. The image resolution is 9.2ft (2.8 metres) per pixel. The nucleus is deliberately overexposed in order to reveal the faint jets of activity . This Osiris narrow-angle camera image shows part of a large fracture running across Comet 67P’s neck, in particular where it has left Hapi and is extending into Anuket. In this orientation, the Seth region is at the uppermost left and Hapi in the lower left . The biggest question remaining about the comet, though, is how it formed. Two predominant theories remain: either it is the result of two smaller bodies ‘sticking’ together, forming a single comet, or its central neck has been eaten away over time like the core of an apple. The latter theory is supported by the observation of numerous jets ejecting material from the comet’s neck. Images from the cameras have shown an increase in the amount of dust flowing away from the comet in the past six months. The comet has also been producing increasing amounts of water from ice melting on its surface, from 0.3 litres per second in early June 2014 to 1.2 litres per second by late August. As the comet approaches the sun, Rosetta scientists are expecting to see more ‘outgassing’ from the surface as the temperature increases. This close-up shows a curious surface texture nicknamed ‘goosebumps’. The characteristic scale of all the bumps seen on the comet is approximately ten feet (three metres), extending over regions greater than 330ft (100m). They are seen on very steep slopes and on exposed cliff faces, but their formation mechanism is yet to be explained . This wide-angle view of Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko was taken by Osiris on 12 September 2014 .","US and European scientists have revealed amazing new images of comet 67P Churyumov/Gerasimenko.

As in previous years, Donald Trump was a regular target, but the favourite for the Republican presidential nomination was not present.
Mr Obama's dramatic exit, featuring a mic drop, gained a standing ovation.
The event was attended by journalists, politicians and film and television stars.
""The Republican establishment is incredulous that he's their most likely nominee. They say Donald lacks the foreign policy experience to be president. But in fairness he has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world: Miss Sweden, Miss Argentina, Miss Azerbaijan.""
""Is this dinner too tacky for the Donald? What could he possibly be doing instead? Is he at home eating a Trump steak? Tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel? What's he doing?""
""Foreign leaders they have been looking ahead, anticipating my departure. Last week, Prince George showed up to our meeting in his bathrobe. That was a slap in the face. A clear breach of protocol.""
""Ted had a tough week. He went to Indiana... stood on a basketball court and called the hoop a basketball ring. What else is in his lexicon? Baseball sticks, football hats, but, sure I'm the foreign one!""
""The end of the republic has never looked better,"" Mr Obama told Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus. ""Congratulations on all your success. The Republican party, the nomination process - it's all going great.""

52528,"After bowling out Somerset for 211, the Bears looked set for a two-day defeat on 61-8, chasing 184 to win, with spinner Jack Leach taking 5-33.
But ninth-wicket pair Rikki Clarke (42 not out) and Chris Wright (38 not out) then more than doubled the score.
Putting on 70 so far, the highest stand of the match, they closed on 131-8.
Having survived the extra half hour with growing confidence, it leaves the Bears needing 53 more runs to win on day three, although Somerset will start favourites to take the two wickets they need.
In a match of twists, turns and fine individual performances on a wearing, used pitch, Leach's 'five-for' was not the only one of the day.
Bears spinner Jeetan Patel, the Championship's leading wicket-taker, had earlier claimed the 24th five-wicket haul of his long career, taking 5-86 to boost his tally to 64 for the season.
First-innings hero Dom Bess also weighed in with two more scalps for figures of 8-59 so far on his Championship debut.
And 40-year-old former England opener Marcus Trescothick got in on the act, taking three more catches.
His six in the match is just one short of Chris Tavare's 27-year-old Somerset outfielders' record, but he did equal the county's career record total of 393, set 79 years ago by former England all-rounder Jack White.
But a game in which Somerset were bowled out for just 95 on the first morning might already be over if home skipper Chris Rogers had not been crucially missed at long leg on six on day one.
The former Australia Test opener went on to post the game's only half-century, making what could yet prove a match-winning 58 as he shared in stands of 39 with Trescothick and 55 with Peter Trego.
ECB Cricket Liaison Officer Phil Whitticase was sent to view the second day's play, but it was batting errors, rather than the pitch misbehaving, which accounted for the majority of wickets.
Somerset spinner Jack Leach told BBC Radio Somerset:
""It was a great day for me because first I went past 50 first-class wickets for the season, then 50 Championship wickets, before ending up with a five-for.
""It has been a crazy two days of cricket and Rikki Clarke and Chris Wright have batted really well to set up the prospect of an exciting finish.
""We still feel in a good position because they have to play themselves in again tomorrow and the ball has tended to do more for the bowlers in the morning sessions.""
Warwickshire director of cricket Dougie Brown told BBC WM:
""Rikki Clarke and Chris Wright have shown what is possible on this pitch if batsmen are prepared to apply themselves.
""Again there were too many soft dismissals in our innings and we still have a lot of work to do. But we are in with a chance and it will be a big day for us.
""The wicket has been tricky to bat on but by no means unplayable. If we can add a further 20 or 30 without losing a wicket it could put the Somerset bowlers under pressure.""",Warwickshire took a 2-0 lead in the Championship match against Somerset in the second day of play.
60661,"David De Gea punched the air in celebration and roared at the fans in Old Trafford’s East Stand. The delight of beating Liverpool, of keeping a clean sheet, of producing another masterclass in goal was plain to see. For Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney and others who believe De Gea is maturing into the best goalkeeper on the planet, Sunday’s 3-0 win over the old enemy provided more evidence to support their case. Three one-on-one blocks from Raheem Sterling and another three excellent saves to deny Mario Balotelli made the Spaniard an obvious candidate for man of the match.

The 24-year-old no longer looks like a man overwhelmed by the task of following in the footsteps of United greats like Edwin van der Sar and Peter Schmeichel. ‘He’s the best keeper in the world,’ said Rooney. ‘He’s shown great form and some of his saves are incredible. ‘Edwin van der Sar had the best years of his career when he was with us in his late 30s so David has a great future ahead of him. If he keeps working hard the way he is, he will have many years at the top.’ To play such an important role in defeating Liverpool was particularly sweet for De Gea. It was in a harrowing FA Cup defeat to the Merseysiders almost three years ago that he hit his lowest point at United. De Gea cut a haunted figure as United lost at Anfield in January 2012.

Staff feared he was not up to the physical demands of English football and pining for home. United duly opened talks with Stoke over a £15million deal for Asmir Begovic that would have seen De Gea relegated to second choice. However, they persevered with him and the boy grew into a man. De Gea bulked up significantly with the help of protein shakes and long hours in the gym. He has exuded confidence this season behind an ever-changing United defence. He can communicate better with his team-mates because he has learned the language, but also due to the influx of Spanish speakers such as Juan Mata, Angel di Maria, Ander Herrera, Radamel Falcao and Marcos Rojo.

He has also benefited from work with the club’s new goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek, who helped develop Van der Sar at Ajax in the early 90s. Rooney said: ‘To play in goal for United at 20 is difficult, especially trying to replace Van der Sar, who was a fantastic keeper. ‘We knew it might take time with David and it did. The first six months, probably a year, it was hard but he worked hard on his game and it shows.’ De Gea is understood to be uncertain about the presence of another Spaniard, Victor Valdes, the former Barcelona No 1 who has been training at Carrington and is expected to play in a behind-closed-doors friendly later this week. If all goes well, he will be offered a deal to replace Anders Lindegaard as De Gea’s main competition. Meanwhile, United are said to be relaxed over De Gea’s contract which runs out in just 18 months’ time, and confident he will sign a new one despite growing interest from Real Madrid.

79771,"Editor's note: A nationally syndicated columnist, Roland S. Martin is the author of ""Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith"" and ""Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America."" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland S. Martin says he doesn't buy all the hype associated with Valentine's Day. (CNN) -- With retailers hurting and the U.S. president trying to encourage Americans to spend money to restore consumer confidence, what I'm about to say may seem like treason. But here goes: Please boycott Valentine's Day and all that is associated with this horrendous ""holiday."" For several years I have ripped into Valentine's Day. Not because I'm against love and relationships, but mainly because the holiday is such a farce. First of all, Valentine's Day is not built around a religious event like Christmas or Easter; nor does it have any special meaning to the nation such as Memorial Day or Veterans Day. It is nothing more than a commercial holiday created by rabid retailers who needed a major shopping day between Christmas and Easter in order to give people a reason to spend money. Now folks, I love my wife. She is truly an awesome woman who is smart, talented, fine, and, did I say fine? But do I really need a special day to show my affection for her? I've long maintained that if I sent my flowers at other times during the year, why do I have to fall victim to peer pressure and send her some roses that have quadrupled in price leading up to February 14? Why should I be inundated with mailings, e-mails and commercials to show her that I love her by buying jewelry or clothing? If we went shopping in June or September or last month, can I get some kind of waiver or ""Get out of Valentine's Day"" card? As for this silly flower thing, it's even got to the point that any flowers can't do. Some years ago I planned on sending a woman some flowers that weren't roses, and the (female) co-workers were aghast. They felt that nothing mattered except roses. First of all, I didn't have a lot of dough and felt a nice bouquet was sufficient, but they were appalled. So I told them to go to hell and I'll do what I want. I guess for them, the thought really doesn't matter. Then there are the women on the job who measure the love of their men based on those flowers. You know how some folks are. If there are flowers on the desk of 10 other women, and one woman doesn't have anything, folks get to talking and whispering as if something is wrong in her relationship. I've learned that even if you get the biggest-ever rose bouquet -- the relationship might be crumbling and  you just refuse to admit it. And Valentine's Day really isn't even a two-way street. Men are utterly irrelevant except to serve as pawns in this commercial game, emptying their wallets in order to satisfy their lovers or those around them. Oh yea, retailers know the con game. Most of these guys are hapless saps who have ignored their wives or girlfriends all year, so they buy the flowers and candy, and set a reservation at one of the city's most expensive restaurants, all to say, ""Honey, I love you."" Ladies, and men, stop it! It's time to say enough is enough with Valentine's Day. What do I want? How about men and women loving, caring and sharing the other 364 days a year? February 14 isn't the only time to send flowers to your woman (ladies, we wouldn't mind getting a surprise delivery as well!). How about dropping her a flower arrangement on May 14? And on that card you need to write, ""Just because..."" Instead of men and women spicing up their sex life on February 14, make the effort to satisfy your mate the rest of the year. If last Valentine's Day was the last time you took your significant other out to a really nice restaurant, you deserve to be in trouble. Are you planning to treat your man or woman to a wonderful day at the spa this Saturday? Well, I'm sure he or she would thoroughly enjoy the same in June or July. It's time that we all take stock of our relationships and learn that we are to be loving and fulfilled 365 days a year, and not reduce our affection to flowers, candy, jewelry, clothes and a meal on one day a year. The people who plan their lives around Valentine's are like those who spend more time planning their wedding day rather than planning their marriage. The day is nice and wonderful, but what makes it last is what you do on the ""non-special"" days. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of Roland Martin.",Roland Martin: Valentine's Day is a commercial holiday created by retailers. He says it's time to stop promoting Valentine's Day as a way to show love. Martin: Valentine's Day is a good day to be with your partner 365 days a year.

41464,"I was a high school student in 1983, when the video for ""Thriller"" was released, getting plenty of air time on MTV. By then, the network's ""M"" could just as easily have stood for Michael. It was an event. At a time when MTV was criticizing for not featuring black artists, Michael Jackson's success changed all that. I can remember getting together with a group of friends to watch the premiere like it was a new movie release. The video did not disappoint. Once again Michael disregarded all conventions of the genre and not just redefined, but completely re-imagined, what a music video could be. But most people don't know that the album broke new ground in a non-musical way, too. Viewers today of MTV, with its steady stream of reality shows like ""Real World 22 - Cancun"" and ""16 and Pregnant,"" might forget that, when it started nearly three decades ago, MTV was all music, all day. Actually, it wasn't really all music. It was just what MTV considered rock music. By the late 1970s, radio formats had essentially resegregated the music world. When MTV launched in 1981, it modeled its playlist on the popular album-oriented rock radio format of the day, which meant that music by black artists was effectively excluded from the network.

10298,"By . Luke Salkeld . Bitter: Neale Hogg sent his ex-fiancee threatening letters asking her to reimburse him for hotel stays, clothes and others gifts he spent on her . As the Beatles told us, money can’t buy love. But when Neale Hogg’s relationship broke down, he believed he should be recompensed for the cost of his wooing. Hogg, 55, bombarded his former fiancée with invoices for the £3,250 he forked out while romancing her, on hotel stays, meals, clothes and an engagement ring. Every penny he spent during the 18-month relationship with nurse Martha Muzhange was totted up before he sent demands for the ‘debt’ to be paid in full. The civil servant even wanted a refund for the price of an MOT test, and became so desperate to get his money back from 54-year-old Miss Muzhange he sent letters to her fellow church-goers. Swansea magistrates’ court heard the pair became engaged after meeting on dating website and planned to marry later this year, but split up in January. Prosecutor Laura Carthew said: ‘Hogg repeatedly contacted her asking for his money back. ‘He posted letters through her letterbox demanding money from her and asking for backdated cheques. These items appear to have been delivered on an almost weekly basis.’ She added: ‘At one point he even went to Ms Muzhange’s church and started giving letters to her fellow parishioners. ‘She can no longer go to church because she’s afraid of repercussions.’ Hogg, of Fforestfach, Swansea, admitted harassment and was given a 12-month community order and told to have treatment for alcohol addiction. Magistrates also granted a restraining order preventing him from approaching or contacting mother-of-two Miss Muzhange, who arrived in Britain from Zimbabwe in 2002. Bombarded: Hogg met Martha Muzhange (pictured) through an online dating website and had planned to get married later this year before breaking up . Simon Howell, defending, said: ‘At the end of the relationship he felt very strongly that this was money owed to him. ‘But he has now decided to forget about what he considers a debt owed to him by this lady.’ Father-of-one Hogg, who has lost his job with the DVLA after 12 years, said he proposed after two months of dating. ‘We got on very well, we went on holidays and trips – all the sorts of things you do as a couple when you’re in love,’ he said. ‘Martha is from Zimbabwe and in their culture they have a different way of doing things. ‘You have to be accepted into the . family, then the head of the family will have a word with you and you . have to pay a dowry to kind of buy in. We got to Christmas and that was . all fine but then it started to go downhill and we had some major . disagreements. ‘We fell out big time and I was disowned by her relatives.’ In a statement read to the court, Miss . Muzhange said she had suffered medical problems since the incident and . was afraid for her safety and that of her son, daughter and her . grandchildren. The invoice blitz is the second time Hogg has appeared in . court before charged with offences against the woman he once planned to . marry.

87695,"By . Vanessa Allen . Princess Diana leaked information about the Royal Family to reporters to show the ‘forces that were ranged against her’, it was claimed yesterday. She sought out journalists as allies in her bitter divorce battle with estranged husband Prince Charles and gave them information to ‘take him on’, the Old Bailey heard. News of the World journalist Clive Goodman said she sent him an internal phone directory for the Royal Household to reveal the size of Charles’s palace staff and complained she felt ‘swamped’ by his aides. Gift: Clive Goodman, left, told the Old Bailey today that he was sent a royal directory by Princess Diana . Goodman is accused of paying public . officials for Royal Household directories but told the phone hacking . trial that Diana sent the directory to him at work and called him twice . to ask if he had received it. He . said the book, dated from 1992, arrived at his desk in an envelope, but . he did not think he was the only one to receive one from the princess. The internal phone directory was known as the Green Book. Goodman . said: ‘She was going through a very, very tough time. She told me she . wanted me to see this document, she wanted me to see the scale of her . husband’s staff and household compared to hers. ‘She was in a very bitter situation with the Prince of Wales at the time and she felt she was being swamped by his household. ‘She . was looking for an ally to take him on, to show the sort of forces that . were ranged against her. We were quite a powerful organisation to have . as an ally.’ Contacts: The book provided the details of the people working for the royals at Buckingham Palace . Awkward: Charles and Diana in 1992 as they toured India . Charles and Diana separated in 1992 after an 11-year marriage and the warring Waleses set up separate households. Goodman, . 56, the former royal editor at the now defunct Sunday tabloid, was . asked if he was the only journalist she had sought out as an ally. ‘Oh . gosh no, there were several journalists,’ he replied. ‘She was very . close to Richard Kay at the Daily Mail, she was very close to Andrew . Morton who went on to write her biography, and she was forming a . relationship with Martin Bashir at Panorama.’ Diana . eventually gave an interview to Panorama in 1995, in which she . complained her husband’s relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles meant . there were three people in her marriage. The couple divorced shortly . afterwards. Goodman told the . court he was given two more directories by a former valet for Prince . Charles, Kenneth Stronach, and said the valet was ‘thoroughly fed up . with working for the Royal Family and the Prince of Wales particularly’. 'Bully': Andy Coulson has been accused of creating an aggressive atmosphere at the News of the World . Trial: Rebekah Brooks is pictured with her mother Deborah arriving at the Old Bailey this morning . He . said he used the directories as a ‘glorified phone book’ to contact . press officers and senior members of the household about stories outside . normal office hours. Following . Diana’s death in 1997, he said, the palace press office was ‘frankly . useless’ so he called the Queen’s private secretary in the early hours . for a ‘very frank conversation’. Brooks' mother Deborah Weir, arriving at the old bailey today . He . told how following her death, amid public anger at a perceived lack of . respect from the royals, there were demands for a flag to fly at . half-mast over Buckingham Palace. The . palace refused because of ‘stuffy protocol’, he said, but a flag . suddenly appeared for 20 minutes at half-mast and then disappeared . again. Press officers told him it was a mistake but he used the . directories to find an ‘enraged’ fireman at the palace who admitted he . had hoisted the flag in protest. Police . found 15 directories at Goodman’s home when he was arrested in 2006 . over phone hacking. He said he could not remember where the other . directories had come from but said he had never paid a police officer . for any directory, or for information for a story. He also denied using . the directories to help him to hack phones or  ‘blag’ information. The . jury was told Goodman worked at the News of the World for 20 years . before he was arrested for phone hacking in 2006. He admitted hacking . and was given a four-month jail sentence and sacked from the newspaper, . although he later accepted a £140,000 settlement over a claim of unfair . dismissal. He was then . arrested again in 2011 by police investigating hacking at the tabloid, . and denies two charges of conspiring to commit misconduct by paying . public officials for royal directories. Goodman . is not accused of hacking in this trial although he is named as part of . an alleged plot in which former News of the World editors Rebekah . Brooks and her successor Andy Coulson are accused of conspiring to hack . phones. They both deny the conspiracy and all seven defendants in the trial deny all the charges against them.

29019,"A California medical student is facing felony theft charges after allegedly stealing the iPad of a dying cancer patient. Natalie Packer was a patient at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center being treated for an aggressive form of breast cancer when she went into cardiac arrest. Only after the chaos of the Code Blue response and attempts to revive her did Packer's family notice that the iPad that had been her source of entertainment and communication had disappeared. Virginia Nguyen has since pled not guilty to petty theft, grand theft of lost property, and computer access and fraud . The loss was especially wounding to her family, as Packer had used the iPad to write personal messages and information meant for sister Nicole. The iPad wasn't missing for long. Shortly after Natalie's death, the family used the device's finder app and saw the iPad was still somewhere in the Medical Center - except that the registration had been changed from 'Natalie's iPad' to 'Virginia's iPad.' The family contacted police, and a search warrant issued to Apple for the reregistration information revealed the iPad was in the hands of Virginia Nguyen, 32, a third-year med student, NBC Los Angeles. She was arrested on the campus in March and hit with criminal charges this July. Nguyen has since pled not guilty to petty theft, grand theft of lost property, and computer access and fraud. Cancer victim Natalie Packer's iPad went missing when she went into cardiac arrest, but uncle Sam Heller said an app to find the device revealed it had been re-registered to Virginia Nguyen . Nguyen told police that she only picked up the iPad because she had mistaken it for her own. 'If you analyze it, it's a pretty lame defense,' said uncle Sam Heller. Heller insists his niece was the kind of woman who would have offered the iPad as a gift if she knew someone wanted it so much and said he cannot understand why anyone would jeopardize their medical career over it. A felony conviction in the case could severely damage Nguyen's future in medicine said Cassandra Hockenson, a spokesperson for the California Medical Board. The accused has declined to respond to interview requests. As NBC Los Angeles notes, Nguyen's LinkedIn profile lists her summary as 'committed to providing social justice and healthcare for diverse populations.' However the University has issued a statement that she is: 'not currently employed at UCLA.' UCLA would not comment on her current status as a student, only that the university enforces an honor code. 'In those instances when a student's conduct does not meet those standards, we have administrative procedures that ensure appropriate due process is afforded to the student while also moving swiftly yet fairly to ensure accountability to these standards,' read a UCLA statement.","Natalie Packer was a patient at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center being treated for an aggressive form of breast cancer when she went into cardiac arrest.

32258,"The Obama administration is in full damage-control mode after the Department of Health and Human Services was forced to admit Wednesday that fewer than 27,000 signed up for Obamacare health plans through the disastrous healthcare.gov as of Nov. 2. The federal government's horrible numbers come out to 744 people per state. Thirty-six states are relying on . healthcare.gov to process all their enrollments. Fourteen states plus . the District of Columbia have their own and better run healthcare exchanges. Enrollments in these brought the total signing up to 106,185. That number represents just 1.5 per cent of the 7 million the Obamacare system will need to attract by the end of March in order to take in enough money to pay for its expected financial outlays in 2014. During his daily briefing on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney deflected questions seven separate times about the administration's expectations for enrollments by the end of November. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius doesn't have much to applaud, with dismal numbers to show for the hundreds of millions of dollars spent implementing the Affordable Care Act . Failure: The butt-of-jokes healthcare.gov website turned in worse numbers than anyone expected, registering just 27,000 people through Nov. 2 . The . 15 state-level websites, which have experienced fewer problems than the . one run by the federal government, signed up about 79,000. They are . averaging 5,267 sign-ups each. Making . matters worse, doubts still remain about what those numbers mean, since . HHS included Americans who have chosen insurance plans and put them in . virtual 'shopping carts,' but not yet paid for them. In early September the Obama administration projected that 494,620 people would sign up during October. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters on a conference call that her system is gathering steam despite the poor showing. 'Even with the issues we’ve had, the marketplace is working and people are enrolling,' she insisted. 'There is no doubt the level of interest is strong.' The administration said Wednesday that a total of 975,407 people 'have made it through the process by applying and receiving an eligibility determination, but have not yet selected a plan.' That number includes hundreds of thousands who will receive government subsidies. Last laugh: Conservatives have been calling for Obamacare's repeal for three years, and will feel vindicated now that the system's results are nowhere near what the White House and its health agencies have promised . House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Rep. Fred Upton has proposed a rollback of Obamacare fines and requirements for anyone who has their own individual health insurance plans as of December 31 . Sebelius said last week in a Senate Finance Committee hearing that HHS expects 1 million to enroll by year's end. But House Ways and Means Committee . Chairman Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, suggested in a statement that . the Obamacare system has little hope of recouping its losses. 'Even . if this data was an accurate picture, the administration would need to . enroll 68,000 people per day to meet their year-end goal,' he said . 'However, the website isn’t even designed to handle that much . traffic and is currently capable of only handling less than half that . much.' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell complained that 'only in Washington could placing an item in a virtual shopping cart – without even buying it – count as a sale' 'If private businesses used that standard, online retailers would be poised to announce their best earnings season in American history,' he mocked. Most of the people who have enrolled in plans chose free Medicaid coverage or plans available through the Children's Health Insurance Program. Those options will cost taxpayers billions without putting any new money into the system through monthly insurance premiums. Nearly one-third of the nationwide enrollment numbers came from California. Success stories in Florida and Texas, which are part of the healthcare.gov portal, were just  3,571 and 2,991, respectively. Lame, wounded duck? Presdient Obama promised that Americans who liked their health plans could keep them, but more than 4 million have received cancellation letters because of his signature insurance overhaul law . Unimpressed: House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp said HHS still needs to enroll 68,000 people every day through December 31 to reach its year-end goal . Those . three states have been a key part of the administration's strategy from . the beginning, since they are home to a large plurality of the nation's . uninsured, a group that the White House sayd numbers more than 50 . million. Whistling past the graveyard? Kathleen Sebelius said last week that she still expects 1 million Americans to sign up for Obamacare coverage by Dec. 31 . The White . House as strained to keep expectations low in recent weeks, following a . chronically ill launch of the Affordable Care Act's main website. CNN analyst Gloria Borger called the healthcare.gov episode 'a complete disaster for the administration' on Wednesday. 'It's clear that they've been low-balling what to expect, and I'm not quite sure they low-balled it enough.' HHS . has promised that the site would be fully fixed and functional by the . end of November, but a report in the Washington Post today . But the White House has only assured reporters that it will work for a 'vast majority' of Americans. Americans . for Prosperity, a conservative group that has long opposed Obamacare . and mocked its rollout, said in a statement that the White House is . shading the truth, even with its lower than expected numbers. 'In the real economy, a business doesn't count sales until they've actually been paid,' said the group's president, Tim Phillips. 'The Obama administration however, is counting 106,185 Americans as having enrolled, regardless of whether they've actually purchased a product or not.' More than 4 million Americans have lost their health insurance in recent months as a result of Obamacare's new requirements covering private insurance. President Obama is under intense pressure to keep his oft-made promise that taxpayers who are happy with their existing medical insurance policies would be able to keep them. Former President Bill Clinton said this week that he thought the law should be tweaked to allow the government to keep its pledge.","106,185 people signed up through healthcare.gov as of Nov. 2.

23255,"Efforts continue to reach consensus on other key issues such as levies on bank deposits.
Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades is to hold talks in Brussels with the EU before Cyprus's parliament reconvenes.
Cyprus needs to raise 5.8bn euros (Â£4.9bn; $7.5bn) to qualify for a 10bn-euro bailout.
On Friday, the Cypriot parliament passed a total of nine bills, covering three main elements of the rescue plan including:
The bank levy issue may come before parliament later in the weekend. A levy, possibly of around 15%, on all deposits over 100,000 euros, has been suggested.
By Chris MorrisBBC News, Nicosia
The eurozone is really turning the screw on Cyprus, and it's being led by Germany.
The message is crystal clear - your economic model has to change. They will no longer accept the idea of a national economy within the eurozone that is dependent on its reputation as an offshore tax haven.
There is huge irritation with the way the Cypriots have handled things, and that has led to the imposition of deadlines which mean big decisions need to be taken very quickly.
The cost of cleaning up the Cypriot banking system must be borne by investors in the Cypriot banking system - like it or lump it.
The ""solidarity fund"" would allow the pooling of state assets for an emergency bond issue, reports the Reuters news agency.
These include future gas revenues and some pension funds - an idea that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has strongly condemned.
Under the bank restructuring, Cyprus' troubled lenders will be split into so-called good and bad banks.
Before the series of much-delayed votes in an emergency session of parliament, the European Union, Germany and leading bankers all urged MPs to speedily pass the reforms.
Eurozone finance ministers have called a meeting on Sunday to discuss the Cyprus crisis.
The European Central Bank has given Cyprus until Monday to raise the bailout money, or it says it will cut off funds to the banks, meaning they would collapse, possibly pushing the country out of the eurozone.
The EU has postponed next week's summit to discuss free trade with Japan, so European leaders can concentrate on trying to solve the Cyprus crisis.
Banks on the island have been closed since Monday and many businesses are only taking payment in cash.
There were protests outside parliament on Friday.
Before Friday's parliamentary session, government spokesman Christos Stylianides said the authorities were engaged in ""hard negotiations with the troika"", made up of the EU, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

Cypriot Finance Minister Michael Sarris returned from Moscow on Friday, having failed to garner Russian support for alternative funding methods.
He said a levy ""of some sorts"" remained ""on the table"" despite widespread fury among both ordinary savers and large-scale foreign investors, many of them Russian. Russia is a key investor in Cyprus.
One of Ms Merkel's allies in parliament, Volker Kauder, said nationalising pension funds would be ""playing with fire"".
He said it could not happen because it would hurt what he described as ""the pensioners, the small people"".
Correspondents say Germany is saying that Cyprus cannot expect any more help from Berlin, or Brussels, than what has already been offered.
Some help has been forthcoming, with the announcement that Greece's Piraeus Bank would take over the local units of Cypriot banks. This would safeguard all the deposits of Greek citizens in Cypriot banks.
Mr Stylianides urged the country's MPs to ""take the big decisions"" to prevent a financial meltdown.
""We must all assume our share of the responsibility,"" he said.
Leading Cypriot bankers have urged parliament to accept a levy on bank deposits, as originally proposed under the bailout, but with smaller depositors exempted.
The plan, overwhelmingly rejected on Tuesday, would have made small savers pay a 6.75% levy, while larger investors would have paid 9.9%.
Bank of Cyprus chairman Andreas Artemis said: ""It should be understood by everyone... especially from the 56 members of parliament... there should not be any further delay in the adoption of the eurogroup proposal to impose a levy on deposits more than 100,000 [euros] to save our banking system"".
If ordinary savers are exempt, then larger investors, many of them Russian, would have to pay an even higher rate, if a levy does remain part of the scheme.
The government fears this would prompt foreign investors to withdraw their money, destroying one of the island's biggest industries.
Businesses in Cyprus have been insisting on payment in cash, rejecting card and cheque transactions.
""We have pressure from our suppliers who want only cash,"" said Demos Strouthos, manager of a restaurant in central Nicosia.
Our correspondent says he has never seen this much pressure being applied to a member state by the rest of the eurozone community in recent years.
Eurozone partners are saying Cyprus has got to change its banking system, which is over-reliant on foreign depositors, and the money it needs has to come out of that system, one way or another, he adds.","The Cypriot parliament has passed nine bills covering the country's plan for a rescue from the eurozone, including a levy on bank deposits."

Its figures show that one in four have symptoms of depression, severe enough to warrant intervention.
Men with mental health problems have formed a support group to help others in Tondu, near Bridgend.
Ruth Coombs, Mind Cymru's manager for influence and change, believes that older men suffering from mental health problems often slip through the net.
""We know that when you get older you may retire, you may get made redundant and not work again, and that can be very difficult,"" she said.
""You get that sense of isolation, you may lose your social groups.
""Also, you may experience a loss of income, a loss of physical ability and if men lose their partner they're losing another protective factor around their mental health.
""So men do need to be supported.""
In Tondu, a group of about 25 older men with mental health problems have formed a support project called Squirrels Nest.
Alan Roach, 67, who is one of the founder members, said there was little support locally catering for older men with mental health issues.
""We all have days when we go back into recession, as we say. But being here, it helps,"" he said.
""It's when you don't have anything to do or anywhere to go - that's when your mind starts wandering.  And when it starts wandering you know you're going bad again.""","Men with mental health problems often slip through the net, a charity says."

When the organisers first mooted the idea of a scene with the Queen and the James Bond actor Daniel Craig, they assumed the best they could hope for was her permission to use a lookalike. But according to Lord Coe, the chairman of the organising committee for the Games, when it was put to her by the Prime Minister she said she would have a lookalike in the scene where she jumps from a helicopter – but would play herself in the Palace. Lord Coe said: 'We were aiming very, very high. We were stunned when she agreed.' Mr Campbell said the decision was part of the Queen's leadership qualities which have made her popular with the public. 'She signed off every element,' one of her team told Mr Campbell, he writes in the Sunday Times today. 'It was a great moment for us, because she was in her mid-eighties by then, her standing was totally secure, and what that did was show a truly global audience not just that she had a sense of humour, but that the British public had huge affection for her and recognised her unique place in their lives.'

Mr Campbell said even as a life-long republican he has 'developed a huge admiration for the Queen, not least for her skills as a leader'. He said: 'In challenging times she has secured the monarchy for at least another generation and, given the way Prince Charles and the younger princes have developed as part of a concerted strategy by 'the Firm', probably much longer than that.'

Dr Goodall called it a ""discrete"" issue and said he would not comment further while the investigation was ongoing.
A spokesman for the health board said two members of staff had been suspended.
Mr Goodall indicated issues involving capital spending contributed to the health board being placed in special measures.
He told the public accounts committee the spending matters were one of numerous problems that contributed to the north Wales board being put under more direct Welsh government control last week.
Welsh ministers said then the move into special measures had been prompted by ""serious and outstanding concerns"" about Betsi Cadwaladr's leadership.
The decision  came two weeks after a report found ""institutional abuse"" at the now closed Tawel Fan mental health unit at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Denbighshire.
A spokesman for Betsi Cadwaladr health board said: ""Early in 2014 concerns arose regarding the cost of the YGC [Ysbyty Glan Clwyd] hospital redevelopment programme.
""The health board took swift action to initiate an audit review of the scheme and subsequently referred matters to NHS counter fraud services.
""An investigation involving NHS counter fraud services and North Wales Police is, we understand, ongoing.
""Two members of staff are suspended whilst this investigation progresses.""
Concerns about control of large investment projects at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board were raised in a review published last week.
The report said ""considerable control problems have been experienced over the management of capital schemes and until the Welsh government are satisfied that better controls have been instituted then this area will remain the subject of intervention"".
On Tuesday, the Welsh government said it could not comment on the police investigation while it was continuing.

The mother-of-two was told the disease had already spread to the surrounding tissue and a hysterectomy would no longer work as there was not enough healthy tissue to perform the operation.

She said she knew something was wrong as she was experiencing symptoms that had not been present when she was pregnant with her first child. But she was reassured by professionals who she claims told her the symptoms were the result of her pregnancy. She said: 'My pregnancy was awful, I knew there was something terribly wrong.

'I knew the pain and bleeding after intercourse wasn't normal but when medical professionals reassure you that its pregnancy-related you trust their judgement. Unusual bleeding . In most cases, vaginal bleeding is the first noticeable symptom of cervical cancer. It usually occurs after having sex. Bleeding at any other time, other than your expected monthly period, is also considered unusual. This includes bleeding after the menopause (when a woman's monthly periods stop). If you have any type of unusual vaginal bleeding, visit your GP for advice. Other symptoms of cervical cancer may include: . Advanced cervical cancer: .

'I never imagined I was suffering from cervical cancer, I had never missed a single smear test.' Doctors also told Mrs Maye they had found a 7cm benign tumour on her kidney, which will be removed during an operation scheduled for later this year. She said it was terrifying being diagnosed and is on edge, waiting to find out if treatment has worked. 'I don't want to die, I have only just got married to Andrew and we have two young children together,' Mrs Maye said. 'We are all waiting for the all-clear now, my specialist has told me that the intense treatment is working but we won't know if I'm cancer free until two months time.' A healthcare professional thought Mrs Maye was suffering from the baby blues. But having been through one pregnancy already, Mrs Maye believed something else must be wrong. When she was finally given a smear test she was told by the nurse that she was bleeding internally. Three days later specialists revealed they had found abnormal cells. Mrs Maye, said: 'When I went to have my biopsy done they told me that they were 99.9 per cent sure it was cancer and they were right. 'Andrew and I just broke down, it was devastating.' But after months of treatment, Mrs Maye, husband Andrew, and their two boys, Bradley, two and Jenson, now nine-months, are hoping for a cancer-free Christmas. Mrs Maye said: 'My next follow up with my consultant is October 6, the same day as my husbands 40th. 'I'll find out if my cancer has gone at the end of the year. We need some positive news after what has been the worst year imaginable. 'I hope other women, pregnant or not, read my story and look-out for the symptoms of cervical cancer. 'I'm lucky I was diagnosed before it was too late but I want others to realise that you don't just have to be up to date with your smears to avoid getting the disease.' Mrs Maye and her family have been supported throughout their journey by a charity called Mummy's Star - set up by Pete Wallroth after losing his wife Mair to cancer, one month after giving birth. Mrs Maye says her pregnancy was 'awful' and she knew something was wrong, but healthcare professionals reassured her the symptoms were related to her pregnancy . Mr and Mrs Maye have two boys, Jenson now nine-months-old and Bradley (pictured). The cervical cancer has destroyed any hope of the couple having more children . Mr Wallroth, founder and CEO of Mummy's Star said: 'Receiving a cancer diagnosis either during pregnancy or shortly after a birth is a situation that affects women across the UK every year but yet which there is very little awareness of or recognition. 'The trauma and challenges this places on a family are devastating, during a time when they should be excited about the prospect of a new birth or celebrating a new arrival. 'After Shelley got in touch with Mummy's Star and explained her situation in June this year we were able to help her in terms of emotional support by being able to speak to other women regularly who shared many of the experiences she was having and yet faced through our confidential forum.' He added: 'In additional I am glad to say that we were able to help her with some of the additional nursery fees that her family were incurring due to her treatment.

38163,"Pancreatic cancer patients who are obese may be 12 times more likely to have cancer that's already spread to their lymph nodes at the time of surgery than similar cancer patients who weigh less, according to a study released Monday in the Archives of Surgery. In the study, 95 percent of patients with a BMI over 35 had a recurrence compared with 61 percent of other patients. ""What we are seeing suggests there is a difference in the way the cancer grows in obese patients versus those who are not,"" says study author Jason B. Fleming, M.D., of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. ""That is an area, from a biology standpoint, that has not really been explored."" Overall, pancreatic cancer patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 35 (223 pounds or more for someone who's 5'6"") were nearly twice as likely to have cancer recur or to die after surgery, as those who weighed less. Health.com: Are you afraid to go to the doctor because you're fat? Obese patients tended to have slightly larger tumors and were less likely to get chemotherapy or radiation before surgery than other patients. However, the survival rate did not seem to be due to the delivery of cancer care or surgical complications related to excess weight, says Fleming. ""People often wonder if obese patients have a worse outcome because they are more inherently at risk for complications, and we did not find that,"" he says. Health.com: How to achieve your feel-great weight . Fleming says gastrointestinal hormones, insulin levels, and the physiology of lymphatic flow in obese patients may contribute to the spread of the tumor cells. ""There is evidence that certain hormones, or growth factors such as insulin, act to stimulate cancer cell growth,"" he says. ""What I am suggesting is that it's not just the tumor that is different, it's the environment the tumor grows in."" In the study, Fleming and colleagues monitored 285 cancer patients who had surgery to remove some or all of the pancreas. They specifically looked at a subset of 20 patients with a body mass index over 35. Health.com: What you should eat to shed pounds . The patients with a BMI greater than 35 survived a median of 13.2 months compared with 27.4 months in patients with a BMI less than 23 (136 pounds or less, for someone who's 5'6""). At the last follow-up, 75 percent of the obese patients had died, compared with 52 percent of patients with a BMI less than 35. Ninety-five percent of patients with a BMI greater than 35 had a cancer recurrence compared with 61 percent of all other patients. People who are obese are at greater risk of getting pancreatic cancer in the first place, according to Fleming. Other risk factors include smoking, long-term diabetes, hereditary disorders, and chronic pancreatitis. The pancreas is an organ located near the stomach; it releases enzymes to help digest food and produces insulin to control blood sugar. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth-leading cause of cancer-related death in both men and women, according to the National Cancer Institute. Even if the cancer is caught early, the prognosis is usually poor because the cancer spreads rapidly, and symptoms (jaundice, depression, weight loss, and upper abdominal pain) may not surface until the advanced stage. Obesity is associated with worse outcomes in other types of tumors too, including breast cancer, according to Fleming. ""This isn't the first time that connection has been made,"" he says. Health.com: Fiber, starch, fats, and serving sizes: Eat right advice for your diet . Tae-Hwa Chun, M.D., an assistant professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, says ""there is good evidence"" that obesity increases the risk for certain types of cancer such as postmenopausal breast cancer, and cancers of the colon, endometrium (the lining of the uterus), kidney, and esophagus. About two-thirds of U.S. adults are considered overweight, and one-third are considered obese, which is a BMI of 30 or higher, according to the Weight-Control Information Network, a service provided by the National Institutes of Health. Simple lifestyle changes, such as daily physical activity, will help spur weight loss and may help ward off some cancers, according to Chun. Not all pancreatic cancer patients are obese or overweight. Recently, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had surgery for pancreatic cancer. Last year, actor Patrick Swayze was found to have stage 4 pancreatic cancer, which he attributes to smoking. Swayze has been reportedly undergoing chemotherapy.

A massive bust of Hadrian's head unearthed only last year is part of the exhibition at the British Museum. One of his first acts was to pull the troops out of Mesopotamia, modern-day Iraq, a fact that is sure to resonate with visitors to the British Museum""s superb exhibition ""Hadrian: Empire and Conflict"" which opens on 24 July under the imposing classical dome of the Reading Room. Curator Torsten Opper says: ""No matter what our take is on the conflict in Iraq today, we can relate to Hadrian's decision. Maybe 10 or 15 years ago, it wouldn't have mattered so much. Now it does."" Hadrian was born in Rome to a noble family whose origins lay in Spain. One of the greatest of Rome's emperors, he consolidated imperial power, was a patron of architecture and travelled extensively across his lands. Though married, he also took a homosexual lover, Antinous, whose drowning in the river Nile on the very day Egyptians were celebrating the death in a similar manner of the god Osiris remains one of ancient history's great unsolved mysteries. The range of exhibits and their rarity means that this exhibition is going to be extremely well-attended. Visitors will, for example, be the first members of the public anywhere to see a huge head of the emperor that was dug up recently at Sagalassos in central Turkey and would have once crowned a statue that was over five metres high. ""A year ago, this was still lying buried in the ground,"" says Opper. ""It""s proof that Roman history isn't done and dusted; that we are still able to rethink the past and evaluate it."" The exhibition brings together 180 objects, from 31 sources in 11 different countries. ""It hasn't been an easy thing to do,"" adds Opper. ""Many of these objects leave huge gaps in their home collection and many are extremely delicate. This isn't an exhibition that can travel. People will only be able to view it for these three months."" Many of the most delicate objects are also those that give the most dramatic insight into Hadrian's reign. Between 132AD and 135/6AD the Jews of Judea rebelled against Roman rule. Some of the insurgents took refuge in a cave in the desert, called the cave of letters, in which they were trapped by Roman troops. Few made it out alive. The climatic conditions of the cave have preserved objects in astonishing condition. There is a letter written by Jewish leader Simon Bar Kokhba (enquiring about a delivery of supplies), as well as mirrors, a jewellery box and an astonishingly delicate glass plate, probably made in Alexandria, that somehow survived flight into the desert and the perilous climb up a cliff to the cave.

78031,"By . James Chapman, Daily Mail Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 02:38 EST, 13 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:49 EST, 13 June 2013 . Steel: Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured leaving Number 10 this week, urged the Tory party not to buckle . Theresa May has cast herself as the Tories’ new Iron Lady, telling colleagues pushing through unpopular spending cuts and reforms: ‘Whatever you do, don’t buckle.’ In another speech ranging far beyond her Home Office brief, the most senior woman in the Government insisted it was possible to do ‘more for less’ across the public sector – highlighting welfare, defence and local government. Mrs May also suggested the Government had to do more to stand up to vested interests in the private sector – particularly banks and big utilities. ‘Big, unaccountable businesses that manipulate markets or abuse their monopoly positions should also be in our sights. 'Whether it’s the banking sector, where customers find it difficult to switch companies, or the big utility firms, with their opaque pricing plans, or the oil industry, which stands accused of price fixing by whistleblowers, we should be as tough with the private sector as we are with the public sector,’ the Home Secretary said. In a speech to the centre-Right think tank Reform, Mrs May, who has been careful not to stray from her brief since speculation about her leadership ambitions erupted earlier this year, sketched out a broad platform for a Tory victory in 2015. The steely Home Secretary, hailed as ‘Britain’s Angela Merkel’ by her allies, said the Conservatives’ mission went far beyond the elimination of the vast budget deficit left behind by Labour. She pointed out that her party had questioned the level of Labour’s public spending as long ago as the 2001 election campaign but ‘sadly our argument fell on deaf ears, and we all know what came next’. A senior Tory minister today fuelled speculation that Theresa May is positioning herself as a future party leader. In the Commons Labour MP John Spellar (Warley) said Mrs May could benefit from persuading police forces to buy more British vehicles, as he urged Government departments to back the country's car industry. Mr Spellar: 'Will you talk to the Home Secretary and get her to back British industry? It might even help her leadership ambitions.' Mr Fallon prompted cheers from the Commons as he replied: 'They may not need that much help.' ‘High taxes, a structural deficit, . unreformed public services and an unbalanced economy meant that when the . crash came, Britain wasn’t ready,’ she added. Mrs . May said there was ‘no other way’ than fundamental reform of the public . sector and pointed to her own success in reducing crime, while slashing . budgets. ‘When we said we . would cut central government police budgets by twenty per cent in real . terms over four years, the critics – not just the Labour Party, but . ACPO, the Police Federation and many academics – were united. Frontline . policing would be decimated and crime would go up. 'But in fact, the opposite happened – crime is down by more than ten per cent since the election,’ she said. ‘That crime is down is thanks to the efforts of thousands of officers up and down the country and the leadership of chief constables, but it’s also down to police reform. Mrs May pointed to measures to make . police more accountable via beat meetings, crime maps and elected . commissioners, and the abolition of national targets and the . introduction of greater flexibility in police employment. ‘We’re delivering more with less,’ she insisted. The . Home Secretary said the Tories had to ‘make sure that the debate in . this country never returns to the false choice of more spending or worse . services’. She went on: . 'We have to reassure people about our motives and our values. We have to . show them that we’re committed to universal public services and we must . never appear to be doctrinaire about what we’re doing. 'We . have to be clear that we’re reducing spending on public services not . because we care little for them, but because we have to for the sake of . our economy.' Pointer: Mrs May set out what David Cameron needed to do to win back support and reassure voters he holds Conservative values . Urging Cabinet colleagues not to waver in the teeth of opposition to reforms, she said: ‘Difficult decisions often mean upsetting people – especially when the change involves pay and conditions. But that doesn’t mean you can shirk them. ‘You have to decide what is in the national interest and do it. Keep making your case, always remind people of what you’re trying to achieve, what’s the end objective, but whatever you do, don’t buckle.’ Mrs May would not countenance any sort of leadership challenge to David Cameron, and has repeatedly stressed her loyalty to him. However, she is understood to regard Boris Johnson as ‘faintly ridiculous’ and is determined to prevent him becoming leader in the event of the Tories losing the next election.",Home Secretary hints at private sector 'manipulations' and monopoly firms.

53385,"By . Nick Fagge . and Ben Spencer . and Tom Kelly . A Bulgarian Roma woman believed to be the real mother of the ‘blonde angel’ found in a Greek gypsy camp declared yesterday: ‘I want her back.’ Mother-of-ten Sasha Ruseva, 35, claims she did not sell Maria, now four, but was forced to leave her daughter with a friend in Greece as a baby because she could not afford the legal documents required to take her home to Bulgaria. But the Daily Mail can reveal that a woman of her name has twice previously been arrested for trying to sell babies in Greece – and on both occasions skipped bail. Scroll down for video . A DNA test has confirmed Sasha Ruseva a Bulgarian Roma woman is the mother of a mystery girl known as Maria, found living with a couple in Greece . Mother-of-ten Sasha Ruseva, 35, (children, left) claims she did not sell Maria (right), who is now four years old . Today the Mail tracked down Mrs Ruseva, who police believe will be shown by DNA tests to be Maria’s real mother, to an impoverished gypsy camp in Nikolaevo in rural Bulgaria where her family share a one-room home without running water. Her husband Atana Rusev, 37, has an albino gene in his family that may have resulted in Maria’s blonde hair and pale complexion. Five of the couple’s other children are blonde and closely resemble Maria. Mystery has surrounded the identity of the parents of the blue-eyed girl since she was discovered after police raided a Roma gypsy camp in central Greece last week. A couple who posed as her parents for four years to make money from her begging are believed to have bought the child for £850. Maria’s case attracted global attention, with thousands of calls from people who believe they may know her identity. Mrs Ruseva wept yesterday as she insisted: ‘I did not sell Maria, nor did I give her away. For the past four years I have never forgotten Maria. I pray for her every day. I want her back, I want her back.’ Mother-of-ten Sasha Ruseva, 35, whose children are pictured here, claims she did not sell Maria . A woman with the name Sasha Ruseva has twice previously been arrested for trying to sell babies in Greece . Mrs Ruseva, who was just 13 when she had her first child, said she was pregnant with Maria when she went to Greece to work as a field hand on a farm with her husband. She said her eldest daughter remained in Bulgaria to look after her other children but that arrangement stopped when she got married and wanted to move out, forcing Mrs Ruseva to return home. She claimed she could not bring Maria back with her as the Greek authorities required she pay ‘hundreds of euros’ for a birth certificate for her daughter, which she could not afford. She said: ‘I gave birth to Maria about four and a half years ago. I can’t remember the exact date. ‘I cared for Maria for seven months but I had to come back to Bulgaria look after my other children. ‘I left my daughter with my room-mate. She is also Roma. When I left Maria I asked the woman to send  her to Bulgaria. But she hasn’t. I cannot remember her name, it was four years ago. ‘I missed Maria but I don’t have any money so I did not know what to do. I called the woman several times and I knew she was safe and well. I don’t know why she kept her so long, why they did not send her back to me. ‘I don’t have enough money to call the woman in Greece any more so I stopped trying to get in touch with her. I didn’t know what was happening with my child. But I have never stopped wanting her, she is my own flesh and blood.’ This is the family's one-bedroom home in the impoverished gypsy camp in Nikolaevo in rural Bulgaria . Mrs Ruseva, who was just 13 when she had her first child, said she was pregnant with Maria when she went to Greece to work as a field hand on a farm with her husband . Mrs Ruseva and her husband registered the birth of a child four years ago at a hospital in Lamia, an hour from the Farsala camp where Maria was found. Greek police think Maria may have been sold on by a baby-smuggling gang who offer newborns to childless couples for up to £22,000. It is believed that Maria was sold for a knockdown price because police were moving in on child smugglers in the area. Judicial records show that a Sasha Ruseva was arrested in early 2009 – the same period as Maria  was handed to the gipsies in Greece – on suspicion of trying to sell a baby, but she skipped bail and escaped with the child. In January this year a Sasha Ruseva was arrested in Thessaloniki, close to the Bulgarian border, for the same offence. On that occasion a child was taken into care and the mother was charged but disappeared before a court hearing. Sotiris Koutsobelis, deputy mayor of Lamia, the town where Maria was born, told the Mail last night: ‘It seems that Ruseva has been selling babies all along.’ An ID card for a baby – the only documentation needed for it to be taken between Greece and Bulgaria – costs just 15 euros (£12.80). A man claiming to be Mrs Ruseva’s brother last night alleged she had sold Maria for 250 euros, contradicting her account. The man, who asked not to be named, told local radio: ‘We knew that my sister had a child in Greece, and gave it to friends there because it was impossible to support it, but she and her husband would see her quite often in Farsala. They still love Maria very much. She told us that the couple paid her 250 euros for the child.’ Judicial records show that a Sasha Ruseva was arrested in early 2009 - the same period as Maria  was handed to the gipsies in Greece - on suspicion of trying to sell a baby . Greek police think Maria may have been sold on by a baby-smuggling gang who offer newborns to childless couples for up to £22,000 . Mrs Ruseva and her husband were arrested and questioned for a few hours yesterday morning by Bulgarian police as part of a joint operation with Greek officers. Mr Rusev said: ‘I never got any money for Maria. The police asked us questions about her, but we don’t know anything. We told them we want her back.’ He added: ‘I can’t remember all of my children’s names because there are so many of them.’ His brother said Mr Rusev has been ‘out of his mind’ since he first saw a picture of Maria on Bulgarian television two days ago and has barely stopped drinking since. The family survive on child benefit payments of £40 a month from the Bulgarian state and live on potato soup and homemade bread. Mrs Ruseva said: ‘Look at us, look at the place we live. We don’t have anything. We have only one bed. Three of the children sleep in it. The rest of us have to lie on the floor. ‘I don’t know how to pay for  their clothes. That is why I send them to school dirty and without shoes or clothes. Look at me. Look at how dirty I am.’ DNA testing is being carried out on Mrs Ruseva and the authorities have collected information about her trips to Greece in recent years. Greek police chief Astelios Matziokas said: ‘This information is the best lead we have for finding Maria’s parents.’ Mrs Ruseva said: 'Look at us, look at the place we live. We don't have anything.' Greek police chief Astelios Matziokas said: 'This information is the best lead we have for finding Maria's parents.' Hristos Salis, 39, and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, who posed as Maria’s parents, are in custody in Greece accused of child abduction. Maria’s case has spurred concerns about child trafficking within the Roma community, as well as accusations of racism towards them. In an episode apparently prompted by the Greek case, two blond, blue-eyed children were taken by police in Ireland from their Roma parents who had different physical characteristics. The girl and boy were returned to their families on Wednesday after DNA tests determined the children were rightfully theirs.","Sasha Ruseva, 35, claims she did not sell Maria, now four, to a friend in Bulgaria.

99987,"In the jittery days that have followed the violent clashes between Lebanon's army and fighters loyal to the radical Sunni preacher Sheikh Ahmad al-Assir, the army has two urgent tasks.
The first is to find Mr Assir, who managed to melt away as soldiers stormed the apartment block he had turned into a fortress in the heart of a residential district in the southern city of Sidon.
The second - and more important - task is to reassure an increasingly anxious Lebanese public that it has the capacity to restore calm and maintain order.
It is no surprise that Mr Assir has been the catalyst that has set off the chain of military and political reactions which has left the Lebanese army facing perhaps its most testing week since neighbouring Syria erupted into civil war.
You can trace the sheikh's rapid evolution from fiery, if rather eccentric, radical Sunni preacher to militia leader in fragments of video widely shown on TV here.
In older footage, there are amusing stunts in which the smiling sheikh takes busloads of his followers onto a ski slope. The cultural message was heavy-handed but harmless, even charming: Islamists like to play in the snow with their children just like everyone else.
But more recent pictures show a much darker figure emerging as the darker clouds that hang over Syria threaten to blow across the border.
We see him long-bearded in a black boiler suit with a Kalashnikov slung across his chest.
It was the civil war in Syria that transformed the sheikh, according to his friends and supporters, just as it threatens to transform everything else here.
As a Sunni radical he has always been a fierce critic of the Shia militant movement Hezbollah. But as Hezbollah began sending fighters in larger and larger numbers to Syria to fight for the government side, Mr Assir decided that fiery denunciation was no longer enough.
He began encouraging his own Sunni followers to travel to Syria to fight for the rebels.
With Mr Assir on the run, I went to the port of Tripoli to talk to another influential Sunni cleric who has issued a similar call to arms.
Sheikh Salem Rafii has also told the young Sunni men of Lebanon to go and fight in Syria - but says men like him and Mr Assir are merely responding to Hezbollah's decision to go and fight there first.
""There's no doubt that Hezbollah has been interfering in Syria,"" he told me.
""That's a factor that can ignite a crisis in Lebanon. If war happens here it will be because of Hezbollah.
""They're stoking the fires in Syria and naturally that will be felt here,"" Mr Rafii says.
It seems impossible that large numbers of young men can continue crossing from Lebanon into Syria to fight on either side of that bitter and protracted civil war without eventually bringing the violence back across the border.
That is why this week's clashes in Sidon matter - because they provide a dangerous template that could easily be repeated elsewhere in Lebanon on a larger scale.
It started with clashes between rival Shia and Sunni groups, which Lebanese soldiers moved in to quell.
The more serious violence erupted after one of Mr Assir's men was caught at a military checkpoint with unauthorised weapons in his car.
The precise sequence of events that followed the discovery is a subject of fierce dispute, but the bottom line is not: there was heavy fighting between the army and Mr Assir's followers, which left 17 soldiers dead.
When the army finally overran Mr Assir's compound it found heavy weapons and military-style uniforms.
And it was not just the scale of the violence that worried ordinary Lebanese - it was the way in which its roots could be seen so clearly in Syria and in how quickly it had sucked in the forces of the state here.
Lebanon is home to a patchwork of ethnic and religious communities very much like Syria's, and they have been held - almost miraculously - in a kind of delicate equilibrium since the country's own civil war ended more than 20 years ago.
Events in Syria are putting that delicate equilibrium under strain; the longer the war there continues the greater that strain will become.
No-one knows where Mr Assir has gone - he is in hiding and may even be in Syria - but men like him and his counterparts in the rival Shia community hold the key to what happens next in Lebanon and how deeply this country will be affected by Syria's war.
After the events of the last week here it is harder than ever to be optimistic.",The Lebanese army is facing a new challenge.
39992,"Campaigners in Willersey near Chipping Campden claim the diocese has failed to keep them informed about the proposals.

She denied the diocese had ""covered up"" its plans to sell 35 acres of land for development.
Bishop Treweek attended a public meeting about the plans on Tuesday evening.
Angry campaigners claim the proposals could eventually lead to 450 new houses being built, which would more than double the size of the village.
Resident Phillip Ord said: ""The bishop won't come clean and say who is going to take the final decision... I'm not very optimistic about it.""
Bishop Treweek said it was ""quite unusual"" for a bishop to turn up to such a public meeting but she ""felt it was important"" for people to realise she was being ""transparent and honest"".
She said it was ""incredibly sad and very disappointing"" that the diocese had been accused of a cover up.
""Things have not been good in the communication process but to suggest anyone's been underhand or I'm not coming clean is just untrue,"" she said.
She said she had received ""a couple of parcels of food with anonymous notes attached which might have been well intended"", but had gone rotten by the time they arrived.

86442,"By . Simon Cable . Bleak future: Sir David Attenborough said big-budget programmes would lose funding . On and off screen, he has been responsible for some of the most enduring BBC programmes of the past 60 years. But Sir David Attenborough fears that quality programming could soon become an endangered species because of the huge rise in on-demand internet services and digital networks. The veteran wildlife presenter, who was controller of BBC2 in the 1960s, said the boom in satellite TV and online services such as Netflix – which has almost 50million subscribers – is leading a decline in viewing figures that will result in budget cuts. He fears that output such as . big-budget adaptations of Shakespeare plays will eventually only appear . on niche networks which don’t have mass audiences. Speaking at an event to mark the 50th anniversary of BBC Two, the 87-year-old was shown a series of clips highlighting its major cultural programmes, including a production of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar by the National Youth Theatre. The presenter of the renowned Life On Earth series said: ‘I think in another 25 years, or another fifty, that kind of stuff you see there…I don’t believe people will be producing Shakespeare. 'I really don't think they will, because the television audience is becoming split and split and split. ‘I saw figures the other day and Life . on Earth got 17million viewers on the first showing and has had hundreds of . millions since. 'You could sink money into making a production like that . because you know what’s going to happen. Acclaimed: Sir David with mountain gorillas in Life On Earth in 1979, after he was BBC2 Controller . A BBC impartiality review that gave . its coverage of the EU and immigration a clean bill of health was . ‘seriously flawed’, a report has found. Last year’s Prebble report – commissioned by the BBC Trust – found its . coverage was ‘broad and impressive’. But . a fresh study published by respected think-tank Civitas yesterday shed . doubt on its methodology, saying a series of basic errors meant it was . ‘not independent and not worth the paper it was printed on.’ Civitas . identified several flaws in the BBC report’s research methods and . questioned the independence of its author Stuart Prebble. The . 63-year-old – who is the former chief executive of ITV – has spent . years making programmes for the BBC through his independent production . company. It . said: ‘In particular, its analysis of output on BBC Radio 4’s Today . programme was severely limited because it monitored less than half of . the Today programme and then focused rigidly on the 7am to 8.30am block . and ignored Saturday’s broadcasts altogether.’ Yesterday, . Mr Prebble defended his report, saying: ‘I regard this as an . ill-founded smear and the authors should be ashamed of themselves.’ A . BBC Trust spokesman said: ‘We stand by the report and the conclusions . that the Trust drew from it, and we do not recognise this inaccurate . characterisation of it. ‘The . approach Stuart Prebble took in reaching his conclusions is consistent . with that taken by all previous authors of impartiality reports for the . Trust.’ ‘But every time you get another satellite on the air, you are diminishing the audience. You won’t get audiences of 17million again. 'So eventually you won’t get the budget to make those sorts of programmes.’ ‘So what will happen? Well, I suspect . that specific organisations will decide they are going to circulate . natural history programmes or Second Wold War documentaries, or operas . or Shakespeare in a different kind of way, and it won’t be available as . it is at the moment, and should be at the moment, to the universality . that comes from a licence.’ As Controller Sir David was . responsible for commissioning programmes such as Man Alive, Call My . Bluff, Chronicle, Life, One Pair of Eyes, The Old Grey Whistle Test and . Civilisation, a ground-breaking 13-part series on the history of Western . art. He later went on to present the world-renowned Life series for the BBC. Recent years has seen a huge increase in on-demand online streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and LoveFilm Instant. Netflix now accounts for more than half the video streamed over the internet and has almost 50m subscribers. It now produces its own series like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. Sir David’s comments were echoed by the BBC’s creative director Alan Yentob, who said: ‘The great thing about British television is that the traditions that broadcasting has emerged from are traditions of intelligence and inclusivity. ‘Those values have been shared by the whole of public broadcasting. Now we are living in a different world. This is a very tricky moment we are talking about. You’ve got Netflix, you’ve got Amazon, you’ve got what might seem like benign predators who are no longer as benign. ‘They’re all public companies now and they’ve got very vast pockets. ‘The BBC is about to do a huge Shakespeare season thanks to the licence fee, and the public consensus needs to support the idea of these things if you still want to see the kind of things that we have valued for a long, long time.’ It was earlier this year that the BBC announced it was closing youth-orientated arts channel BBC Three following a series of cost-saving measures. The channel will be broadcast only online from Autumn 2015.

33438,"By . Lydia Warren . When their two-year-old son was diagnosed with a life-threatening brain tumor, Devon and Valerie Morse didn't think it could get much worse. But just weeks later, Devon, who is a Marine, also began feeling sick and doctors revealed the unthinkable: that he, too, had a brain tumor. Now the family, who live at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in Havelock, North Carolina, are trying to come to terms with the news as they attend medical appointments across the state. Fighting together: Devon Morse is pictured with his two-year-old son; both have a brain tumor . 'If it were to come worse to worse for me, I would rather have myself go than my son,' Devon told WCTI12. 'I would rather him see that life that he deserves.' The family's battle began in March when David began vomiting, suffering from nosebleeds and struggling with his balance. They took him to hospital, where he underwent a brain scan. Doctors revealed that the toddler had a tumor the size of a tangerine in his brain - and that it was malignant. 'I stopped and I cried and I cried,' Valerie told WCTI. 'And my husband had to walk out of the room, just to take a breather real quick. Fight: David was diagnosed with brain cancer in March and is now undergoing chemotherapy . Still smiling: The family say they have been touched by donations and kindness from the local community . 'My son looked up at me, and said, ""What's wrong, mommy?"" And I just lost it.' David underwent surgery and doctors were able to remove most of the tumor. He is now undergoing chemotherapy. But then in April, Devon began suffering numbness in his body and doctors revealed that he also had a tumor in his head. His was much smaller than his son's, and doctors deduced that it was more dangerous to try to remove it, so they left it and are treating him with medication instead. Devon continues to undergo treatment, as well as regular hospital visits. Hopeful: They are pictured with mom Valerie, who said she has found the diagnoses heartbreaking . The community has rallied around the young family, and the local fire and police stations have been collecting donations and toys for the Morses, who are feeling the financial strains. On the family's Facebook page, they expressed their thanks to Cherry Point police for their kindness. 'Today you let David play in the squad car, and to see our baby boy laugh and smile like that made us cry inside... to know that there are people out there that care for and about him, and that do everything they can to keep him happy and smiling,' they wrote.

One of the longest standing mysteries of migration has finally been solved after scientists discovered where the UK's Painted Lady butterflies go each autumn. The large, colourful butterflies, commonly seen in the UK countryside, migrates to our shores in varying numbers from the continent each summer. But until now scientists had no idea whether the Painted Lady made the return journey at the end of summer, like the closely related Red Admiral, or simply died in the UK. Long distance traveller: A Painted Lady butterfly sits atop lilac flowers. A new study of their migration habits has finally solved the mystery of where they disappear to each winter . Thanks to a massive survey of the creatures' habits, it has now been revealed that they make an epic intergenerational journey each year spanning thousands of miles from Africa to the Arctic and back again. In one of the largest citizen science projects ever conducted, scientists from Butterfly Conservation, the NERC Centre for Ecology & Hydrology and Rothamsted Research amongst others, discovered exactly what happens to Painted Ladies each autumn. More than 60,000 public sightings of . the butterfly were collected across Europe during 2009, with 10,000 . British observers taking part. Painted Lady on an Oxeye daisy: The creatures undertake a huge migration from Africa to the Arctic that takes them six generations to complete . Scientists also used radar to track their . movements across southern England. They discovered that the Painted Lady did indeed migrate south each autumn but made this return journey at high altitude out of view of butterfly observers on the ground. Radar records revealed that Painted Ladies fly at an average altitude of over 500m (1,640ft) on their southbound trip and can clock up speeds of up to 30mph by selecting favourable conditions. The findings also revealed that the species undertakes a phenomenal 9,000 mile round trip from tropical Africa to the Arctic Circle. That's almost double the length of the famous migrations undertaken by Monarch butterflies in North America. The whole journey is not undertaken by individual butterflies but is a series of steps by up to six successive generations. Painted Ladies returning to Africa in the autumn are thus several generations removed from their ancestors who left Africa earlier in the year. The UK's first major study of 'flying ant day' has revealed not one but two flying ant days, and indeed large numbers of ants were reported over two flying ant weeks. When the UK’s garden ants took to the air this summer, the Society of Biology received over 6,000 reports from members of the public as part of its first flying ant survey. About one-in-five sightings happened on Tuesday 24th July, and another one in five came two weeks later on Wednesday 8th August. These peaks were extremely striking, but still these two flying ant days accounted for fewer than half of the records. In fact, flying ants were a common sight for the days in July and August around the two peaks. The time between the two peaks was a period of low pressure, which is usually associated with clouds, wind and rain. This suggests that the weather had a large role to play in determining when the ants flew. Professor Adam Hart, an ecologist at the University of Gloucestershire, said: 'We found a relationship between flying ant swarms and weather conditions, which we expected, and geographical variation, which we didn’t expect.' Richard Fox, Surveys Manager at Butterfly Conservation, was one of the report authors. He said: 'The extent of the annual journey undertaken by the Painted Lady butterfly is astonishing. 'This tiny creature weighing less than a gram, with a brain the size of a pin head and no opportunity to learn from older, experienced individuals, undertakes an epic intercontinental migration in order to find plants for its caterpillars to eat. 'Once thought to be blindly led, at the mercy of the wind, into an evolutionary dead end in the lethal British winter, this amazing combination of mass-participation citizen science and cutting edge technology has shown Painted Ladies to be sophisticated travellers. 'We are extremely grateful to the many thousands of members of the public who reported Painted Lady sightings and contributed to this extraordinary discovery.' Radar in Hampshire operated by Rothamsted Research revealed that around 11million high-flying Painted Ladies entered the UK in spring 2009 with 26 million departing in autumn. Dr Jason Chapman, a researcher at Rothamsted Research, who led the radar studies of Painted Ladies, said: 'The apparent lack of a return migration of the late-summer generation of Painted Lady butterflies was one of the greatest enigmas in insect migration ecology. 'But, through a combination of traditional monitoring by butterfly enthusiasts and new radar techniques, we have finally solved this long-standing puzzle. 'Migrant insects continue to amaze the public and research community alike as they are capable of carrying out the most remarkable journeys.'","Large, colourful butterflies migrate to the UK in varying numbers each summer.

70427,"Adam Price accused other AMs of ""sneering"", claiming Plaid was trying to equalise levels of Welsh investment.
A bypass is set to be built in his constituency under a Labour-Plaid deal.
Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said all parts of Wales saw major investments.
On Tuesday, Labour AM Lee Waters warned against ""pork barrel"" budget deals that include bypass projects.
The final Welsh budget for 2017/18 includes £50m for a bypass at Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire.
Mr Price, who represents the town as AM for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, said Welsh Government capital spending in mid and west Wales over four years was half the figure for south east Wales of more than £1,000 per head.
""Next year it is projected to fall to 29% - nothing can justify that level of gap,"" Mr Price said, during finance questions in the Senedd on Wednesday.
""We heard in the chamber yesterday, I would say a rather sneering tone of metropolitan provincialism attacking my party for at least trying to get some concession, some investment, in the regions and the constituencies that we represent.
""We make no apology for equalising the level of investment,"" he said, saying those attitudes were ""were present on the Conservative benches as well, also from members that either represent or live in the most prosperous part of Wales"".
Mr Price, Plaid's economy spokesman, pressed Mr Drakeford on the issue, saying: ""I would ask him this: will he commit to equalising the level of investment across Wales so that it is not left up to my party year in year out to fight for bloody scraps at the bottom of anyone's pork barrel?""
In response, Mr Drakeford said there were major investments in ""all parts of Wales"".
""The vast bulk of the population of Wales lives in certain parts of Wales. It's inevitable that some of the major investments will follow that,"" he said.
Mr Price and Mr Waters have clashed previously on the Llandeilo bypass project.
A tweet where Mr Price said Plaid had secured cash for the scheme had prompted a debate between him and Mr Waters back in December.
Mr Waters called the road project a ""climate busting commitment"" that Plaid leader Leanne Wood had ""insisted on whilst chastising"" Welsh Government ""for not doing enough on climate change"".
Mr Price told Mr Waters that air pollution was the second biggest killer in the UK. ""Diverting traffic away from [the] town is a public health imperative,"" he said.
Mr Waters accused the Plaid AM of ""chronic short-term thinking"".","Plaid Cymru AMs have accused their party of ""metropolitan provincialism"" over plans for a £50m bypass in Carmarthenshire."

For three years she saved her money in hopes of affording heart surgery to correct her atrial fibrillation. ""They [U.S. hospitals] told me it would be about $175,000, and there was just no way could I come up with that,"" Giustina said. So, with a little digging online, she found several high quality hospitals vying for her business, at a fraction of the U.S. cost. Within a month, she was on a plane from her home in Las Vegas, Nevada, to New Delhi, India. Surgeons at Max Hospital fixed her heart for ""under $10,000 total, including travel."" Giustina is just one of millions around the world journeying outside their native land for medical treatment, a phenomenon known as ""medical tourism."" Experts say the trend in global health care has just begun. Next year alone, an estimated 6 million Americans will travel abroad for surgery, according to a 2008 Deloitte study. ""Medical care in countries such as India, Thailand and Singapore can cost as little as 10 percent of the cost of comparable care in the United States,"" the report found. Companies such as Los Angeles-based Planet Hospital are creating a niche in the service industry as medical travel planners.

""We find the best possible surgeons and deliver their service to patients safely, affordably and immediately,"" said Rudy Rupak, president of Planet Hospital. ""No one should have to choose between an operation to save their life or going bankrupt."" Planet Hospital, which works with international clients as well as Americans, books patients' travel and arranges phone interviews with potential surgeons. Patients are greeted by a company representative at the airport in the country where they've chosen to be treated; a 24-hour personal ""patient concierge"" is also provided, a level of service that's standard among many of the top medical travel planning companies.  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta meet some medical tourists » . ""Our patient concierge was amazing,"" said Giustina. ""He came to the hospital every day, gave us his personal [telephone] number and after my operation, he arranged private tours of India.""

A dog reported missing two years ago has been rescued by fishermen who spotted it swimming off the Florida coast. The dog was wearing a collar with the name Baby on it when she was found two miles off Tampa at 7.30am on Thursday morning last week. A microchip led vets to a report showing the dog had first been reported missing two years ago and that her owner had died a couple of months ago. Overboard: Baby the dog with her new owner Kathy Klein, who adopted her after the dog was found two miles out to sea . Mystery: The dog was wearing a collar with the name Baby on it and had been microchipped . Baby, who appeared groomed and well-cared for, was spotted by the crew of a commercial fishing vessel, who could just make her out in the water. 'On the horizon they could see just her . nose sticking out of the water,' Anthony Basile, a resident who temporarily took the dog in after the crew returned her to Demens Landing. I put towels on her. Warm towels on her, put the heat on in the boat. She shook for ten hours straight,' he told the Tampa Bay Times. It is thought Baby could have been in the sea, which was 68F, for up to eight hours. 'We're assuming she fell overboard at night and nobody even knew it,' Suzy Johnson, who helped look after the dog, said. When she was found in the water, the dog had a red collar with diamante studs spelling out the name Baby. Rescue: Anthony Basile nursed Baby back to health after the fishermen who found her brought the dog ashore . Bond: After being rescued by Anthony, the dog refused to let him out of her sight . Caring: Anthony with Baby on his boat in Demens Landing. The dog shook for about ten hours after being saved from the sea . When Banfield Pet Hospital scanned her . microchip, staff discovered she had been listed as missing two years ago. They also found three phone numbers including one that led them to a man in Virginia . who said Baby had belonged to his sister, Charlene Knotts, who died aged 40, two months ago. The man said he . believed his sister's roommate had been caring for Baby, and didn't know . how she could have ended up in the sea, Fox 13 reported. 'Baby was her little lap dog. She fed Baby off her fork and they had quite the relationship,' Deborah Clements, who had lived with Ms Knotts said. The dog was being cared for by a third roommate who found a new home for Baby on Craigslist, but after a couple of days the dog ran away in December. When she was found on January 2, Mr Basile took her in and Baby bonded with him immediately. He had been on his way to the marina office to pay his rent when the fisherman who found her stopped him. After managing to coax her out of the crawl space she was hiding in on their boat, Baby refused to let Mr Basile out of her sight. 'I can't take a step off the boat and she'll start screaming and yelling. I walk with her; she stays right by my side,' he told WFLA. 'I don't know how she made it through this. It's truly not possible. But she did it, somehow. She was out two miles,' he said. New start: Kathy Klein and her husband Larry have adopted the dog and renamed her Gracie . Forever home: The dog has found a new family after being rescued from the sea . Unfortunately he wasn't able to offer Baby a home permanently, but a Florida couple who heard about her story and had offered to help have now adopted her. 'Initially, I wanted to just go meet the . people that were so kind to rescue her,' Kathy Klein said. 'I went and got . a dog bed and a blanket and a dog coat because I knew it was going to . get cold.' But as she helped nurse Baby back to health, and trimmed the knots out of her bedraggled fur, Mrs Klein fell in love with the dog. As well as offering Baby a new home, Mrs Klein has also given her a new name - Gracie - because 'purely by the grace of God did she survive all of this'.",Fisherman spotted the dog swimming two miles off the Florida coast.

Alex Dowsett (Movistar) was in the day's six-man break, but a double puncture saw him fall back to the peloton. The real action came inside the final 3km when Albert Timmer (Giant-Shimano), who had been in the day's break alongside Dowsett, tried to accelerate up Bridge Valley Road following the peloton's passage through the Avon Gorge.

A City Dreaming, a film of his memories of his hometown Londonderry - or Stroke City, as he called it - was aired on Thursday at 21:00 BST.
Written and narrated by Gerry, it uses archive footage to tell the story of the city as he saw it.
The film charts the city's rises and falls over the course of a half a century, touching on everything from Luftwaffe bombings to Amelia Earhart's unexpected landing to first civil rights protests.
It has been shown at film festivals around the world, and was screened in Belfast for the first time earlier this year.
The film's director Mark McCauley said the television premiere was a ""wonderful chance to hear Gerry again in full flow"".
""He just had a wonderful way with words, he really enjoyed life,"" Mr McCauley said.
""He wasn't a man for great formality or sticking by the rules. We love that type of character and he was the embodiment and the spirit of that.
""We're all missing him terribly.""
Gerry's family have said it has been a ""difficult year"" since his death.
But the ""continuous outpouring of support from friends and fans"" had been a great source of comfort, they added.
""In many ways it has been hard to accept that Gerry, the husband, father and grandfather, is no longer with us,"" his family said.
""We are just now able to start looking at and uncovering the wonderful writings and works he left behind, and with them he has left a wonderful legacy for his grandchildren.

The figure was disclosed by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith before letters are sent to households this week explaining a new cap on benefits under which no one can claim more than the average annual working wage of £26,000. The cap comes into force next April and aims to remove the disincentive to work that leaves many of the unemployed better off on benefits. Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘For more than ten years Labour let the benefits bill soar, and these figures show the scale of the problem. ‘It is absurd that people are able to claim as much on benefits as a higher rate taxpayer earns. ‘The welfare state should work as a safety net and then support people to financial independence. ‘That is why I am writing to benefit recipients, to let them know that we will be working with them over the coming year to give them every support to find work and become self-sufficient. 'Our welfare reforms will make sure a life in work always pays more than a life on benefits, and are a clear illustration that this Government is on the side of people who work hard, do the right thing and aspire to a better life.’ The 11,000 households exposed by Mr . Duncan Smith enjoy benefits of more than £34,000 a year, equating to a . gross wage of £47,000. This is enough to put most employees into the . higher rate 40p tax band. This week the Government will write to . 67,000 households that could be affected by having their benefits . reduced to the £26,000 limit, spelling out the support available to find . work. 'A basic issue of fairness': David Cameron . According to official figures, at least 100 families on benefits are living in luxury homes, with many receiving housing handouts of about £5,000 per month – enough to fund a £1million mortgage. Households exempt from the cap include those where there are  people in work and claiming working tax credits, and families that are deemed to be very vulnerable – including war widows and those claiming disability living allowance. People who have lost their job but were employed for 12 months or more prior to claiming benefits will have nine months’ grace before the cap applies. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Many taxpayers struggling to make ends meet will find it incredibly unfair that some people are drawing more in benefits than they’ve ever actually earned themselves. ‘The welfare system needs to provide a safety net for the poorest and most vulnerable in society, but these figures demonstrate that the current system has got out of control and that the Government’s proposed benefits cap needs to be introduced as a matter of urgency.’ The Prime Minister has also said it is ‘time to call time’ on excessive benefits. David Cameron said in January: ‘It’s a basic issue of fairness. Should people really be able to earn more than £26,000 just through benefits alone? ‘I don’t believe they should. And I think the overwhelming majority of people in the country would back that view.’ Ministers will overhaul the tax and benefits system from October next year, when a universal credit will be introduced to simplify the system and replace swathes of tax credits and benefits. They claim it will ensure that no one will be better off on benefits than in work, removing the so-called ‘cliff edge’ where those who take on part-time work end up worse off as benefits are removed. But critics have warned that families affected by the benefits cap could lose their homes, as around 44 per cent of those set to be hit are living in social housing. David Orr, of the National Housing Federation, said: ‘The letters will come as a shock to many vulnerable families. The overall benefit cap is a crude measure that fails to reflect the stark differences in housing costs across the country caused by the desperate shortage of affordable housing.’ He called on councils to share information they had on who could be affected so that housing associations could offer help. ‘With under a year to go before many people start losing their homes, there’s no time to lose,’ he added.","Letters sent to 67,000 households this week explaining new cap on benefits.

The 41-year-old, who has just taken over the anchor role following the prompt departure of Josh Elliott last week, has just completed the sixth of eight treatments to battle breast cancer. She underwent the treatment last week and was back at work the next day.

'Amy considers getting up every morning . and having something to look forward to a gift,' a source told People magazine. 'It's a much needed . distraction from her treatment.' Robach, a mother to two young girls and a step-mother to three boys, was diagnosed with breast cancer five months ago after undergoing a mammogram for the show. She discovered she had a . malignant tumor in her right breast and it was only after she had a double mastectomy soon after that . doctors realized there was a second tumor in the same breast and some . abnormal cells in the left breast. After . the surgery it also became clear that the disease had spread to her . sentinel lymph nodes, meaning that the mastectomy was far from the final . step.

55960,"President Obama on Wednesday signed a law that makes it a federal crime to assault an individual because of his or her sexual orientation or gender identity. The expanded federal hate crimes law, hailed by supporters as the first major federal gay rights legislation, was added to a $680 billion defense authorization bill that Obama signed at a packed White House ceremony. The hate crimes measure was named for Matthew Shepard, a gay Wyoming teenager who died after being kidnapped and severely beaten in October 1998, and James Byrd Jr., an African-American man dragged to death in Texas the same year. Shepard's mother, Judy, was among those at the ceremony that also included Vice President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Attorney General Eric Holder and leading members of Congress and the Pentagon, who were on hand for the appropriations bill signing. To loud applause, Obama hailed the hate crimes measure in the bill as a step toward change to ""help protect our citizens from violence based on what they look like, who they love, how they pray."" He cited the work of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and others ""to make this day possible."" Later Wednesday, Obama stood with Shepard's parents and relatives of Byrd at a separate White House event honoring passage of the expanded hate crimes law. Noting reports of 12,000 crimes based on sexual orientation over the past 10 years, Obama called the bill another step in the continuing struggle for protecting human rights. ""Because of the efforts of the folks in this room, particularly those family members standing behind me, the bell rings even louder now,"" Obama said. When he finished his remarks, he hugged the weeping relatives as the audience applauded. Several religious groups have expressed concern that a hate crimes law could be used to criminalize conservative speech relating to subjects such as abortion or homosexuality. However, Holder has said that any federal hate-crimes law would be used only to prosecute violent acts based on bias, not to prosecute speech based on controversial racial or religious beliefs. Former President George W. Bush had threatened to veto a similar measure, but Obama brought a reversal of that policy to the White House. When the bill won final congressional approval last week, Human Rights Campaign president Joe Solmonese called the hate crimes measure ""our nation's first major piece of civil rights legislation for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people."" Earlier this month, Obama told the Human Rights Campaign, the country's largest gay rights group, that the nation still needs to make significant changes to ensure equal rights for gays and lesbians. ""Despite the progress we've made, there are still laws to change and hearts to open,"" he said in an address at the group's annual dinner.

A now 21-year-old man accused of shooting his father in the face with a shotgun in 2009, prompted in part by a joke about how the boy wasn’t man enough to be with actress Megan Fox, was found guilty of first degree murder in a Florida court Monday. Jason Beckman was 17 when he snapped and, with a shotgun, blasted his South Miami City Commissioner father in the face and neck while he was in the shower. While an appeal seemed likely after the judge refused to allow into evidence Beckman’s Asperger’s Syndrome or his initial police interview where he vehemently denied committing the crime, a string of witnesses for the prosecution painted a very sinister picture of Beckman and his years-long desire to murder his father and others. Beckman now faces life in prison. Guilty: On one of his final days at trial, convicted murderer Jason Beckman smiled and waived goodbye to the court. He now faces life in prison for murdering his father in 2009 . Grisly: While Beckman's South Miami Commissioner father Jay Beckman showered in April 2009, Jason shot him dead with a shotgun . According to a jailhouse informant who testified last week, the final straw in Beckman's hatred . for his father came after Jay Beckman cracked a joke about actress Megan . Fox, which prompted Beckman to finally murder his father. Initially, . Jason was charged with manslaughter after telling police he . accidentally discharged the 12-gauge Browning Citori shotgun by tripping . over it. However, the . charge was later upgraded to first-degree murder when it emerged in the . course of the investigation that the teen had admitted to a neighbor . that he planned one day to kill his father with the shotgun. In court Tuesday, Beckman’s inmate . Michael Nistal told jurors that just before the deadly shooting, Jason . asked his father what he thought about Hollywood starlet Megan Fox. 'His father told him he [Jason] wouldn’t know what to do with that,' Nistal recounted to the jurors, according to the Miami Herald. The . seemingly innocent comment uttered by Jason's father, whom he allegedly . hated and talked about killing for years, pushed the 17-year-old over . the edge, according to the prosecution. Confessors? The lynchpins in the case against Beckman were a jailhouse snitch named Michael Nistal (left), who testified that Beckman confessed to him that he'd killed his father and Lisa Syren, who told the court that Beckman showed her the gun he'd eventually use to kill his father and told her he planned to do so . Murder weapon: Jason Beckman claimed that he went to show his father this 12-gague Browning Citori he had just assembled but slipped and fell, causing the shotgun to fire . Gory: The city chief was shot at a very close range in the shower, the blast nearly blowing his face off and dousing the room with blood (pictured top left) Final straw: Jason's inmate testified that the . teen told him that just before the shooting, he asked his father what he . thought of actress Megan Fox, and Mr Beckman responded that 'he . wouldn't know what to do with that' ‘So he went and got a shotgun and blew his head off. He missed his head and shot his face and part of his neck,’ the inmate said. Nistal added that Jason told him he then poked his father's body with the weapon to see if he was still alive. A photo taken of the teen after his arrest shows him standing barefoot in a grey T-shirt with no visible signs of blood on it, which the prosecutors say suggests that Jason made no effort to come to his father’s aid as he lay dying in the blood-spattered bathroom. Jason Beckman’s defense team, however, insist that the shooting was accidental. Following his arrest, prosecutors say the teenager came clean about the killing to inmates, including Nistal, at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center. Nistal is serving a seven-year sentence for a burglary spree that culminated in a deadly high-speed chase. The convicted felon told the court that Beckman planned to use insanity or self-defense to beat the murder rap, and also talked about killing witnesses after the trial. Jay Beckman, a South Miami city . commissioner, was found dead in his Florida home April 12, 2009, after . his son called the authorities to say he had accidentally killed him. During . questioning after the killing, Jason told police that he had a . 'love-hate' relationship with his father, who had been raising him alone . since his mother died from cancer in 1998. Jason . told police he went to show his father a shotgun he had just assembled . but slipped and fell, causing the shotgun to fire, reported the Miami . Herald at the time. Crime scene: The deadly shooting happened inside the Beckmans' South Miami home on Easter Sunday . Evidence: This photo taken after Jason's arrest shows him in a grey T-shirt with no visible signs on blood on it, which the prosecutors say suggests that he made no effort to come to his father's aid . In her opening statement last Wednesday, prosecutor Jessica Dobbins said that Jason kept a 'hit list' of people he did not like on a piece of notebook paper, and that his father's name was at the top, CBS Miami reported. Defense attorney Tara Kawass responded to the allegations by saying that Jason's outbursts, in which he talked about wanting to kill his father, could be attributed to his Asperger's syndrome - a mild form of autism that caused him to say outlandish things and speak out of turn. Hit list: Prosecutors say for years Jason had been talking about killing his father, whose name was at the top of a list of people he did not like . Kawass added that his list-keeping was a form of coping with his condition, which made it difficult for him to make friends. But the attorney insisted that while her client was socially awkward, he was never violent or aggressive, and he did not pull the trigger on purpose on Easter Sunday in 2009. During testimony on Friday, Jason’s former classmate Jennifer Kaiser told jurors that in the eighth grade she saw the teen bring gun magazines to school, and he once told her that she was on his list, CBS Miami reported. Armando Torres, another one-time schoolmate of Beckman’s, also testified that he heard him say on multiple occasions that he wanted to kill his father.","Jason Beckman, now 21, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the April 2009 shooting death of his father, Jay Beckman.

48248,"If home is where the heart is, a new survey suggests that most people aren't sure exactly where they live. More than half of people cannot pinpoint the exact location of the human heart on a diagram, and nearly 70 percent can't correctly identify the shape of the lungs, according to the survey. This lack of knowledge isn't just embarrassing -- it could lead to a poorer quality of health care, some experts say. In the study, published in the journal BMC Family Practice, a research team surveyed 722 Britons -- 589 hospital outpatients and 133 people in the general population. They gave the volunteers four diagrams of human figures and asked them to choose the one that showed the correct size and location of a specific organ. (For example, the heart diagrams showed various size organs on the far left side of the chest, directly in the center, anchored on the center/left chest, and on the right side of the chest.) Overall, people knew less basic anatomy than the researchers expected -- even those patients being treated for a specific condition involving that organ. Participants generally answered half the questions correctly, including 46.5 percent who knew which drawing represented their heart. In all, 31.4 percent correctly identified the lungs, 38.4 percent the stomach, 41.8 percent the thyroid, and 42.5 percent the kidneys. The intestines and bladder were the most easily identified, with 85.9 percent and 80.7 percent, respectively, answering the question correctly. Health.com: Are you cholesterol smart? Take this quiz . There was little to no improvement compared with a similar study conducted in 1970, says lead author John Weinman, Ph.D., of King's College London. In that study, subjects correctly identified eight major body parts about half of the time. (The researchers used the same body parts from the 1970 study and added three more: the pancreas, gallbladder, and ovaries.) Given the accessibility of the Internet and the prominence of health stories in the news media today, Weinman's team expected that people would now know more about their body. Weinman says he wouldn't be surprised if a study based in the United States produced similar results -- or worse. ""I imagine they would be similar, but there could well be regional variation, depending on which part of the U.S. the participants were from,"" he says. ""Actually, I asked one of my colleagues, who is from the U.S., and she felt that Americans might be worse because, to quote her, 'Very many Americans don't even know where New Jersey is, so how would they know where their pancreas is?'"" Health.com: Eat Smarter in your 30s, 40s, and 50s . That may sound harsh, but time and again, U.S. studies have shown that doctors overestimate how much their patients understand about their conditions and treatment. Adam Kelly, Ph.D., an assistant professor of medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston,  Texas, conducted a 2007 study, that showed that doctors overestimate patient literacy and that a lack of patient knowledge leads to poorer care. Kelly believes the problem could be ""even more profound"" in the United States, although a similar study has not been conducted in America. Still, anatomy may not be the best measure of health literacy, says Sandeep Jauhar, M.D., the director of the heart failure program at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center, and the author of ""Intern: A Doctor's Initiation."" Health.com: Computer games that boost your memory . ""They would like us to draw the conclusion that because the patients can't identify these organs anatomically that that is an indication of low health-care literacy -- and that may or may not be true,"" he says. ""I work with heart failure patients, and whether they can identify where their heart is is not so important to me as long as they know which medicines to take and when."" Many patients with heart failure, unfortunately, don't know which medicines to take, can't identify their symptoms, and don't follow up with their doctors, Jauhar says. ""So health illiteracy is definitely a big problem,"" he adds. ""I just don't know that this is the best study to show that Americans or Europeans are illiterate when it comes to their health care."" The study suggests that patients with liver disease and diabetes may be the most health-literate: They were the only two groups to do better than the general population when identifying their affected organ. Overall, 75.3 percent of those with liver disease could find the liver (versus 45.9 percent in the general population) and 53.7 percent of diabetics could locate the pancreas (versus 30.8 percent). Health.com: How I survived a heart attack at 43 . ""It is possible that patient-education material for people with diabetes may help to increase their knowledge [of the pancreas], but it is still only at the 50 percent level,"" Weinman says. ""The same explanation may also be true for liver disease, but it may be a chance finding due to the sampling of patients for this study, and it really needs replicating in other larger studies to be certain it is a robust finding and to search for possible reasons for it."" Weinman says there's a mountain of evidence to prove that effective communication from doctors increases patient satisfaction and understanding, leading to better clinical outcomes and improved adherence to treatment. Health.com: I lost my insurance, stopped my diabetes medication, and had a heart attack . Jauhar agrees that health literacy improves not only the quality of health care, but also life expectancy.

River Plate defender Ramiro Funes Mori, 24, watched the 2-0 defeat against Manchester City at Goodison Park.
Everton have also had talks with Dynamo Kiev for forward Andriy Yarmolenko yet reports suggest they may now move for Shakhtar Donetsk's Bernard.
""The fact that Ramiro Funes Mori was here was down to the agreement we have with River Plate,"" said Martinez.
Everton are also interested in Uruguayan striker Leandro Rodriguez, a 22-year-old who plays for River Plate Montevideo.
He has an Italian passport and has scored 19 goals in 71 games for the club.
Martinez also has a long-standing interest in taking Manchester United's Adnan Januzaj on loan.
That hinges on whether Old Trafford boss Louis van Gaal feels he needs to send the 20-year-old Belgian out on loan to get further game time.
Mori was on Merseyside with Everton now waiting on the results of a work permit application and a medical before completing a £5m move.
Martinez has also been in discussions for playmaker Yarmolenko - although reports in Ukraine indicated he has turned his attention to Brazil international Bernard as an alternative.
""This is a player who has won the Copa Libertadores with River Plate,"" Martinez said of Mori.
""He is 24 and a left-footed centre half with a winning mentality who will fit the squad extremely well.
""You don't get many opportunities to bring in a player who has won the Copa Libertadores.""

Everton officials held discussions with their Dynamo Kiev counterparts in Monaco on Monday in an attempt to agree a deal for 25-year-old Yarmolenko, who is valued at around £15m.
Talks have continued but have proved tough to conclude.
Bernard, a 22-year-old who figured for Brazil in last summer's World Cup, has now been touted as an alternative to Yarmolenko although it was claimed in Kiev on Sunday that Dynamo are still considering Everton's offer for their talisman.
Martinez repeated his stance that his club have no intention of selling 21-year-old England defender Stones having rejected a third Chelsea offer of £30m and with Jose Mourinho now believed to be planning a fourth bid.
Asked again if he would keep Stones, Martinez said: ""That's the plan. We have enjoyed his development and the way he has grown in the last two seasons.
""He just puts a smile on your face when you see John Stones defending.
""He is an incredible footballer and to be able to organise the way he does and control things at such a young age shows the type of footballer he is.

40834,"With younger brother Jonny in second it was the result that the huge crowds in their home city of Leeds had wanted.
Reigning world champion Javier Gomez was well back in fourth.
Britain's Vicky Holland had earlier taken third in the women's race to underline her own medal chances in Rio.
Holland held off the challenge of her compatriot Jodie Stimpson as reigning world champion Gwen Jorgensen came past long-time race leader Flora Duffy on a storming run.
The brothers, Olympic gold and bronze medallists four summers ago, had been part of a small lead pack that also included Gomez as they exited the 1500m swim in Roundhay Park.
Alistair then accelerated away up the hill on to the bike course, with Jonny bridging across from the chase group to form a pack of four with France's Aurelien Raphael and Australian Aaron Royle.
Find out how to get into triathlon in our special guide.
Working together well round the tight, technical course the four had a two-minute lead coming off the bikes.
And Alistair then hit the front on the run, going out hard to build a 19-second lap after two of the four laps as Jonny pulled clear of Royle and Raphael.
Roared on by crowds four-deep around the city centre course, he had extended that to half a minute as he came back on to the blue carpet for the final time, and was able to high-five his way down the finishing straight as the grandstands in Millennium Square rose to him.
""I had a good day,"" Alistair told BBC Sport. ""My form is nowhere near that good and I think I was carried around by the fact it was in Leeds.
""At the start of the run I would have put my money on Jonny. I was fortunate to have a good day.
""The crowd was just phenomenal - it can lift you and it did today.""
Jonny added: ""It was a tough day, but a great day and no-one is going to beat Alistair on that kind of day.""
Duffy, World Series leader, held a lead of around 40 seconds in the women's race as she and the British pair of Lucy Hall and Jess Learmonth came out of the water.
That had stretched to a minute and a half coming off the bike in transition two, with Jorgensen, Holland and Stimpson in the second group and Britain's 2013 world champion Non Stanford a further 28 seconds back after a disappointing swim.
But Jorgensen, the strongest runner on the circuit, had cut Duffy's lead to just 38 seconds two laps into the 10km run and came storming through coming into the fourth and final lap.
Bermuda's Duffy, who retains her current lead in the rankings, hung on for second while Holland pulled away from Stimpson in the final 100 metres.

David Tredinnick said astrology had a ‘proven track record’ at helping people recover from illness and should be incorporated into standard medical treatments. The MP for Bosworth in Leicestershire also admitted he had prepared astrological charts for fellow MPs – but refused to say who. ‘I am absolutely convinced that those who look at the map of the sky for the day that they were born and receive some professional guidance will find out a lot about themselves and it will make their lives easier,’ he told MPs. Speaking to the BBC this week he added: ‘I think it’s something that people should be aware of as an option they have if they are confused about themselves.’ However, he stopped short of suggesting that the NHS should provide astrological readings. He attempted to pre-empt his critics, describing them as ‘bullies’ and declaring: ‘There is no logic in attacking something that has a proven track record.’ He also revealed that Chris Patten, Britain’s last governor of Hong Kong, had an official astrologer.

41977,"The 35-year-old Spaniard said he was ""100% committed to winning"", adding: ""I want to be world champion.""
Alonso, champion in 2005 and 2006, has not won a race since 2013 as a result of a lack of performance from his cars.
He added that he had never considered joining Mercedes when Nico Rosberg retired at the end of last season.
In a news conference at McLaren's 2017 car launch, Alonso was in an expansive mood and discussed:
Alonso, a winner of 32 grand prix and one of the biggest stars in F1, also gave a withering response to his old rival Lewis Hamilton's recent observation that he regretted the amount of data-sharing in F1 because he felt it allowed his team-mates to learn from him.
Alonso said: ""If he was watching more data from Rosberg last year, maybe he would have won the championship.""
McLaren have had two difficult seasons since the start of their engine partnership with Honda in 2015, with both chassis and engine less effective than those of world champions Mercedes.
Alonso said it was unrealistic to expect McLaren to close what was a 1.5-second gap at the end of last season in one winter.
""We need to recover a huge gap,"" he said. ""Winning having come sixth in the previous constructors' championship is something no-one did apart from Brawn in 2009.
""We started 2017 early enough. We put a lot of resources in this year's car. We changed completely the philosophy of the engine, which is risky but needed if we want to win because the engine of the last two years was not good enough to win.""
He added: ""I expect Mercedes to still be very competitive. We saw their new car yesterday, which seems very well elaborated, and they have the advantage of the engine. They will be contenders. I am sure the Red Bull will be up there and hopefully we can put ourselves in that group.""
McLaren have made it clear they wish Alonso to sign a new contract to keep him at the team after 2017, probably for at least another two years.
The driver reiterated his statements of last year that he hopes the new cars will see a return to ""fighting spirit and racing spirit"", allowing drivers to push hard at all times, before he commits. And he added that he was in no rush to make up his mind.
""After the summer break, around September, is a good time to start thinking and sitting with yourself and deciding what to do,"" Alonso said. ""Until then, I will not think too much about the future.
""Obviously, I want to be world champion. That is what I am training for, why I was running and biking at -10C in the middle of the snow in the last month.
""Travelling to Australia (for the first race), normally I arrive on Monday or Tuesday, but this time I will arrive on the Friday before. I am 100% committed to win and if I can win this year it's better than next year.""
Alonso was one of the drivers Mercedes considered as a replacement for Nico Rosberg, who announced his retirement five days after winning his first world title last November.
But the 35-year-old said he never seriously considered the possibility of moving.
""There were some phone calls that arrived to me but there was no point discussing anything because I was happy at McLaren,"" said Alonso.
""After the surprise of Rosberg they had to do a little check on everyone. It was nothing really strange or a deep conversation. It was a round-check they did with everyone - and me - to assess their situation.
""My situation was very clear. I had this year with McLaren and I am happy here. It was not a point to talk about any further.""
Alonso said he understood Rosberg's decision to retire at 31, but it was counter to his own nature.
""In my case, I cannot stop. It is like a drug,"" he said.
""For him he was very brave to stop. I wish him all the best. It was in his character. I am more a racer. I will be 80 years old in a go-kart pushing kids out of the track. Everyone is different.""","Fernando Alonso has said he is ""happy"" at McLaren and wants to be a world champion in 2017."
73737,"By . Charles Walford . PUBLISHED: . 11:23 EST, 7 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:44 EST, 8 June 2012 . Thousands of commuters had their journeys thrown into chaos after blundering workmen flooded a Tube line with two million litres of water as they tried to fix a leaking pipe. Hundreds of passengers were stranded for up to two hours yesterday, before having to escape along the tracks. The chaos continued this morning, with the Central Line part-suspended and engineers desperately battling to reopen it for the evening rush hour. Nightmare scenario: Passengers became stranded in a tunnel after tracks were flooded with two million litres of water . Ordeal: Staff help a woman off the train after it became stuck in a tunnel when the tracks flooded . One of London Underground’s biggest safety scares ever was caused by Thames Water engineers. A senior Tube source said: 'We are usually to blame when things go wrong but this time we can put hand on heart and say, ""It wasn’t our fault guv"". It was 100 per cent down to Thames Water. 'This has caused one of the biggest safety scares ever. There was so much water pumping in that there were genuine concerns of a tunnel collapse or the water flooding along the tunnel and affecting other lines.' The crisis happened between Stratford and Bow stations at 1.39pm yesterday as workmen were lifting a 24in main to try to plug a smaller leak. But the above-ground pipe cracked, sending 440,000 gallons of pressurised water pouring down a ventilation shaft near Wick Lane. Today the beleaguered utility firm, which has frequently attracted Transport for London’s anger for its 'pointless' and badly co-ordinated road- works, admitted responsibility for a 'tricky' operation going badly wrong. A spokesman said: 'The pipe was encased in concrete and as the crew was working it broke.' Water from the burst caused signals to short-circuit and bring Central Line trains to a halt. Flood on the tracks: Passengers are helped from the tube tracks at Stratford, east London after they were stranded on a Central Line train . Thames Water, which boasts of its role as a supplier to the London Games this summer, now faces a multimillion-pound compensation bill after cars in streets and a housing estate near the Olympic Park were flooded. Transport for London will also expect compensation after services this morning were suspended between Leytonstone and Stratford, causing massive overcrowding during the rush hour. London Underground’s chief operating officer Howard Collins said the crisis was a 'nightmare scenario' for the Olympics, with just 50 days until the opening ceremony. He said: 'As the person responsible for operational readiness, this is obviously something I do not want to happen during the time of the Olympics.' One engineer told the Standard that water was flowing 'like Niagara Falls' onto the dual carriageway leading to the Blackwall Tunnel. 'I have never seen anything like it before,' he said. 'It was a massive incident. There was a river in the street.' Cars parked in Wick Lane were flooded up to their bonnets, while a housing estate that has been earmarked for an anti-terrorist missile system was also affected. Relief: Passengers including young children are glad to see daylight after being trapped in a tunnel . Resident Neil Midgley, 43, said: 'The gym, swimming pool and car park were closed due to flooding.' Tube passenger Kenneth Thurtell, 27, who was travelling from Holborn to Leytonstone, said: 'I spent four hours trying to get home. I felt suicidal, quite frankly. I can’t imagine what it’s going to be like during the Olympics.' Jennifer Hazel, 38 — stranded at Mile End as she tried to get home to Leyton — said: 'If this is what happens when something goes wrong on a quiet day, then good luck during the Olympics.' The Central line is one of two principal Tube routes for the Olympics, with the Jubilee, connecting London’s heart directly with the Stratford stadium. Yesterday the Jubilee and Bakerloo lines each suffered two breakdowns, with the Jubilee suspended through central London. Two broken-down trains caused Victoria line delays. Thames Water, which has been heavily criticised for causing roads gridlock with its lengthy repairs, said: 'We were doing exploratory work on the pipe in Wick Lane yesterday having identified it as a potential weak point on the network ahead of the Olympics. 'This is a 24-inch pipe which is more than 100 years old and when we dug down to investigate a suspected leak, the earth around the pipe moved causing it to burst. 'This has highlighted how weak the pipe was and the potential for it to burst at any time, so we are glad we can now get it replaced before the Olympics. We're really sorry for the disruption that has been caused.'",Hundreds of commuters stranded for up to two hours yesterday. Water from the burst caused signals to short-circuit and bring Central Line trains to a halt.

""He [husband Phil Osborne] had taken her down the shop and tied her up to go and grab me a bar of chocolate of all things, and literally in 40 seconds someone had untied her.
""Since then it's been traumatic. But we'd had no sightings of her, so when we got the phone call it was pretty amazing.""
Mrs Osborne said the family rehomed Bella as a young dog after she was found ""in a state"", and it took her a year to get to full health.
Since then she had been everywhere with the family, including on numerous holidays and up and down Mount Snowdon in Wales.
They were left traumatised when Bella was unhinged from a tree outside Tesco Express on Bridge Street on the evening of 10 October.
Soon after, Northamptonshire Police released a grainy CCTV image of the suspect who walked off with Bella in the direction of Market Hill.
But after weeks of no news, the call that she had been found on the other side of England after being identified by her microchip came completely out-of-the-blue.

2832,"New NATO airstrikes shook Tripoli into early Tuesday after the alliance's secretary-general dismissed complaints that the allied campaign against longtime Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi had fallen into a stalemate. At least three rounds of explosions echoed across the Libyan capital in a three-hour span that began late Monday, and the roar of jets could be heard overhead. Government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told CNN that the warplanes hit administrative buildings in central Tripoli, and that a nearby hospital was ""indirectly"" affected. ""Tonight was an exceptional night in Tripoli,"" Ibrahim said, noting that the strikes followed ""an extended period of calm."" ""It is very sad,"" he said. ""We are losing people every day on both sides. We think it is time to sit down and talk."" NATO warplanes and missiles have been pounding Gadhafi's forces and government installations since March 31 as Gadhafi attempts to put down a nearly three-month-old revolt against his rule. Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN on Monday that Gadhafi and his regime ""have no future,"" but refused to predict how long the Libyan leader could hold on. Rasmussen denied that the situation in Libya had devolved into a ""stalemate,"" insisting that NATO was ""making progress"" and had ""taken out"" a substantial part of Gadhafi's military capability. He said a political solution was required to bring the conflict to an end, but ""It's hard to imagine an end to the violence as long as Gadhafi remains in power."" Despite the ongoing bombardment, Gadhafi's forces have been inflicting a heavy toll on rebels in the port city of Misrata, survivors there have told CNN. Misrata is the only city in western Libya held by the rebels, and witnesses say indiscriminate shelling has left victims with crushed bones, burns and amputations. ""They are shelling the port and civilian neighborhoods. It has become an operation of revenge, not just taking over the city of Misrata,"" said Ibrahim al-Neairy, a rebel who was injured in the fighting and evacuated to Benghazi. Mostafa Bozen, a spokesman for the rebels, said fighters attacked Gadhafi's forces about 22 kilometers (14 miles) from Tripoli, killing 12 and hitting a tank. The situation in Misrata ""is at the forefront"" of U.N. concerns about Libya's civilian population, Valerie Amos, the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told the Security Council on Monday. Two months of fighting and the ongoing shelling of the city's port has prevented aid ships from docking there, and between 150 and 300 non-Libyans are still waiting to be evacuated, she said. ""Some people are running short of food, water and other basics,"" she said. ""Medical facilities need supplies and more trained personnel."" The Security Council voted in March to authorize the use of force to protect Libyan civilians from Gadhafi's regime. Nearly 750,000 people have fled the country, another 58,000 are displaced within Libya and another 5,000 are stranded at border crossings into Libya, Tunisia and Niger, Amos said. For those who remain, Amos said the fighting and the sanctions imposed on Gadhafi and his allies have caused ""a severe disruption of supply lines within the country."" The results have been ""shortages of fuel, difficulties in obtaining commodities including foodstuffs, medicines and other essential goods, and there have been severe cash shortages throughout the country."" Western Libya has about three months' supply of food remaining; the mostly rebel-held east has about two months, she said. Fuel and supplies for desalinization plants and other facilities that provide fresh water to many Libyans ""are running out,"" she added. There have been widespread assumptions among experts that the conflict between pro- and anti-Gadhafi forces will continue to be a stalemate for some time. As time wears on, though, human rights groups have expressed growing concern for besieged Libyans in Misrata. The wounded arriving in Benghazi, the rebel hub city, painted a gruesome picture of the fighting in Misrata. Hanan Muhammad, who was evacuated along with about 800 others on an aid ship charted by the International Organization for Migration, was wounded when a missile struck near her home. ""I was in my house praying when the first missile landed. Shortly after, more missiles, one after another started hitting our neighborhood,"" said Muhammad, who suffered a broken arm and shrapnel wounds. ""Terror. Fear. People are scared every moment of the day no matter their age,"" she said. ""Oh God, it's like a horror movie."" Al-Neairy, who suffered facial burns and shrapnel wounds, said he does not regret fighting. ""The price for freedom is high and it (is) necessary to be liberated from this regime,"" he said. Amnesty International has said Gadhafi's attacks in the port city may amount to war crimes. A report issued last week by the monitoring group accused pro-Gadhafi forces of the ""unlawful killing of civilians due to indiscriminate attacks, including use of heavy artillery, rockets and cluster bombs in civilian areas and sniper fire against residents."" ""I'm not going to guess about a timeline. I want a solution sooner rather than later,"" Rasmussen said. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Sara Sidner and Amir Ahmed contributed to this report.","NEW: At least three rounds of explosions are heard in Tripoli. NEW: A hospital is ""indirectly"" affected. NEW: U.N. says Gadhafi and his regime ""have no future"" Gadhafi's forces have been inflicting a heavy toll on rebels in Misrata, witnesses say."
30254,"The message to Athens is pretty clear: it is time to decide, no more prevarication.
""There's no more space for gambling, no more time for gambling,"" argued the President of the European Council Donald Tusk.
""The risk of insolvency is increasing by the day,"" said the head of the German Bundesbank Jens Weidmann. ""The main losers in that scenario would be Greece and the Greek people.""
Add in the decision by the International Monetary Fund to withdraw its team from technical talks with Greek officials in Brussels, and fly them back to Washington, and the prospects look alarmingly gloomy.
Sometimes the toughest talking happens just before a deal is done.
But occasionally it means things are about to fall apart.
So the public pressure on Alexis Tsipras is growing - reflecting concern within the EU and the IMF that he has miscalculated the extent to which he can orchestrate a change in policy.
But a brief visit to Athens this week was a reminder of the countervailing pressures the prime minister is under at home.
He was elected in January when his party, Syriza - the Coalition of the Radical Left - swept to power. Now his supporters expect him to deliver, and some are taking a hard line.
Twenty-two Syriza MPs wrote a joint letter to Mr Tsipras on Tuesday urging him to implement election pledges as soon as possible to bring back collective bargaining and raise the minimum wage - reversing reforms pushed through over the last few years.
And a Greek court ruled this week that the government should reverse cuts that were made to private sector pensions in 2012, because they were depriving pensioners of the right to a decent life.
Further pension cuts certainly represent one of a number of red lines for the government, but ministers involved in the negotiation process are also aware that a majority of Greeks believe they have to be prepared to compromise in order to avoid national bankruptcy.
""The Greek delegation is ready to intensify deliberations in order to conclude a deal soon,"" said the government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis, ""even in the coming days.""
But all the while, the critics are circling.
""Increasingly, I've become more convinced that they don't know what they are doing,"" said the opposition MP Harry Theocharis from To Potami party.
""We needed a breath of fresh air in politics, but I think Mr Tsipras is probably out of his depth.""
One possible solution under discussion would be to extend Greece's current bailout deal, which expires at the end of this month, until March next year.
And there are still those who believe some kind of face-saving agreement could emerge at a meeting of Eurozone finance ministers in Luxembourg next week.
But the dilemma for Alexis Tsipras is that any deal that will now be on the table will represent a betrayal of a large part of his electoral programme.
Eventually there will have to be a serious examination of Greece's unsustainable debts, as Mr Tsipras demands.
But for now, Europe's only prime minister from the radical left may have put himself in an impossible position.
He wanted less austerity and fewer structural reforms, and in the Eurozone you cannot have both.","The Greek government is preparing to conclude a bailout deal, but it is still a long way from achieving a deal."

Combined, the two firms will be worth about 46bn euros (Â£40bn; $49bn).
The deal will also help to offer a succession plan for Leonardo Del Vecchio, Luxottica's 81-year-old founder.
Mr Del Vecchio, an orphan who became Italy's richest man, founded Luxottica in 1961.
Through a series of acquisitions, including of Ray-Ban in 1999 and Oakley in 2007, the firm has become the world's biggest spectacles maker.
It also has licensing agreements to create eyewear for major fashion brands, including Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana and Versace.
However, it has gone through three chief executives in the past two years after Mr Del Vecchio regained executive powers at the company.
Questions about Mr Del Vecchio's succession plans have also weighed on the firm's share price, which is down 14% in the past year.
The firm said in 2014 that it had previously explored a deal with Essilor, the world's biggest maker of prescription lenses, but that conditions were not right at the time.
""The marriage between two key companies in their sectors will bring great benefits to the market, for employees and mainly for all our consumers,"" Leonardo Del Vecchio, Luxottica's executive chairman said in a statement.","Luxottica, the world's biggest spectacles maker, is to merge with a French lens maker."
60256,"Past outbreaks have devastated great ape populations, particularly gorillas, where the virus is estimated to have wiped out a third of the primates.
A scientific team now says that wild gorillas could be vaccinated to protect the critically endangered animals from further losses.
However some conservationists warn that this would be difficult and has risks.
The study is published in the journal Scientific Reports.
Dr Peter Walsh, from the University of Cambridge, who led the research, told BBC News: ""Now that we have shown this is a safe vaccine, it's really a moral imperative that we use it.
""The disease is a huge threat to gorillas right now.  We vaccinate our children, we vaccinate livestock, we vaccinate our pets, we vaccinate wildlife  - why aren't we vaccinating our closest relatives?""
Gorilla losses
The outbreak of Ebola in West Africa that started in 2013 highlighted the devastating toll that the disease can have in humans: more than 11,000 people are estimated to have died.
But now there is a vaccine that has been shown to be 100% effective against the disease, and the hope is that it will prevent anything on this scale from happening again.
Some scientists say gorillas could benefit from immunization, too.
And Ebola in humans and great apes is closely linked. Many human outbreaks have started after people came into contact with infected gorilla or chimp carcasses or bushmeat (the 2014 outbreak is not thought to have started this way but instead through contact with Ebola-carrying bats).
The disease is extremely deadly for our primate cousins: if chimps or gorillas are infected, there is a 90-98% chance that they will die.
Many thousands of gorillas, which are also facing threats from poaching and habitat loss, are thought to have died from the disease.
""There are whole areas, hundreds of kilometres in every direction, that have just been wiped out of gorillas,"" said Dr Walsh.
To see if immunization could help, a vaccine was tested on 10 captive chimpanzees at a research centre at the University of Louisiana Lafayette in the US.
Because chimps and gorillas are so closely related, the researchers assumed that if the vaccine worked in chimps it would work for gorillas also.
Six animals were given the drug by mouth and four were injected with it.
""We found the vaccine gave a very robust immune response and didn't cause any health complications,"" said Dr Walsh.
Dr Walsh acknowledged the trial was small, but said it was stopped early when a ban on the use of chimpanzees in biomedical research came into force in the US in 2015.
He added that most other parts of the world either have moratoriums or bans on great ape research, and said that sanctuaries and zoos were either unwilling or unequipped to carry out trials.
""Effectively, we just have to start doing it in the wild now,"" he explained.
He wants to see if lacing sweet treats with the vaccine or using remotely operated sprays or darts could help to immunize wild animals.
He is also looking at how to ensure the vaccine remains effective and stable in the heat of the forest and wants to further examine the dosage.
Liz Macfie, vice chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's section on great apes, said that the results of the trial were encouraging and promising.
But she told the BBC that rolling out a wider vaccination programme would be difficult.
She said: ""Some wild apes are habituated to tourists or researchers' presence, so some you can approach. But the majority of the populations are completely unhabituated and it would be very difficult to provide a vaccine into a group of unhabituated apes.""
She also said there were some concerns about safety.
""There's always the risk when you use a vaccine on wild animals that there is an associated pathology or infections that might spreadâ€¦ It's a small sample size that [this vaccine] has been tested in and we don't really know about all of the other effects.""
But she added that conservationists now needed to come together to look at studies like this and assess the best way forward.
These thoughts were echoed by Sarah Olson, associate director of wildlife epidemiology for the  Wildlife Conservation Society.
""An oral vaccine formulation would need to be stable and edible, as gorillas are really picky eaters, safe for target and non-target species impacts, and effective and affordable,"" she said.
""There are other vaccine approaches under consideration but they will all require more research.""
However, Dr Walsh told the BBC that the situation was urgent.
""The Ebola situation is quiet right now in Africa, and there is a danger that people are going to think: 'Oh, that's not a problem anymore, we don't have to worry about it'.
""But believe me, it's been quiet before and then it's come roaring back.
""And that's why, instead of waiting for the crisis, we need to start to develop the tools to protect these animals in the future.""

90554,"Local boy Andy Goode inspired Wasps to the perfect start at their new Ricoh Arena home with a record Premiership points haul that helped sink their former London rivals. The 34-year Wasps fly half, who was born in Coventry and attended the city’s King Henry VIII school, produced a superb display to collect eight penalties, two conversions and a second-half try that brought him 33 points — one better than the previous best shared by Niall Woods (London Irish, 1998), Dave Walder (Newcastle, 2000) and Tim Stimpson (Leicester, 2002). With a record home crowd of 28,254 in attendance and gate receipts in excess of £500,000, things really could not have gone any better on or off the field for the new team in town. Andy Goode (right) is mobbed by his Wasps team-mates after he crossed for a try at the Ricoh Arena . Goode broke the London Irish line to claim his touchdown during his side's emphatic 48-16 victory . Goode successfully kicks one of eight penalties on his way to a 33-point haul at the Ricoh Arena . ‘It sounds a bit cheesy but that’s what dreams are made of,’ said Goode, a lifelong Coventry City fan. ‘It couldn’t have gone any better. I didn’t sleep that well last night. ‘I’ve been up here a fair few times to watch Coventry City play but to run out on the field was unbelievable. ‘I got a hammering from my little girl for missing five kicks last week (against Castres). She made me change my boots and everything. 'As I came off the field she was there and she said, “You’re keeping those boots forever, Daddy”.’ There were clear first-half nerves, not least from rookie referee Tom Foley, whose whistle threatened to ruin any hope of a fluid game. Goode took advantage with unerring accuracy, kicking six penalties in the first 40 minutes after Exiles prop Geoff Cross had briefly threatened to spoil Wasps’ party with an opportunist try for the visitors on 16 minutes . Christian Wade bursts free before setting up Wasps scrum half Joe Simpson to score . Simpson is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring one of Wasps' four tries against the Exiles . Wasps pulled away in spectacular fashion in the second half with Joe Simpson’s try opening the floodgates before London Irish hooker David Paice was sinbinned. Wasps took full advantage with three tries to seal an all-important bonus point. Goode, Elliot Daly and Andrea Masi all crossed as Wasps moved above Quins and Leicester into sixth in the Aviva Premiership table.

Players from both teams receive a warm welcome ahead of Wasps' first game at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry . High Wycombe’s Adams Park felt a long way away in every sense by the time Foley blew his final whistle. The only concern was the worrying manner in which the pitch cut up during the course of the afternoon. No doubt fans of Coventry City will be keeping a close eye on that situation. ‘It was a big occasion for everybody but I’d have taken that before the game,’ said Wasps director of rugby Dai Young. ‘There was some emotion about beforehand. But the bonus point was the icing on the cake.’","Wasps beat London Irish 48-16 at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry. Andy Goode kicked eight penalties, two conversions and a bonus point try.

72465,"Justin Bieber made a $50,000 donation to a youth charity as part of a plea deal to settle a Miami drunken driving case  Wednesday. Bieber, 20, was not in court when a judge accepted his guilty plea to careless driving and resisting arrest in connection with the Miami Beach incident last January. Prosecutors dropped the drunken driving charge in the agreement, which requires Bieber to get 12 hours of anger management counseling, attend a program that teaches about the impact of drunken driving on victims and make the large donation to the ""Our Kids"" organization. The charity donation, although a prosecution demand, could not legally be required in the plea deal, a prosecutor noted during the hearing.  As a result, the payment was made before the judge accepted the agreement. Judge William Altfield delivered a lecture to Bieber, which he hoped his lawyers would relay to their client, asking him to become a better role model for his young fans. ""I hope that he realizes that his actions not only lead to consequences that affect him, but they lead to consequences that affect others who are looking up to him as a role model,"" the judge said. Although Bieber has never been charged with a felony crime or a drug charge -- and he has never been in drug or alcohol rehab -- the judge compared the singer to actor Robert Downey Jr. when he was young. Altfield said that Downey got into trouble ""because of the drugs, because of the alcohol, because of the fame, because of all of the pressures that he had on a daily basis and look at what he's done with his life.  He turned himself around."" ""Here is someone who is young,"" Altfield said of Bieber. ""His whole life is ahead of him and he just hopefully will get the message.  He will grow up.  He will use all of his talents positively for young persons."" The lead prosecutor, in a written statement to CNN, said ""the strengths and weaknesses of the case"" led both sides to agree to the plea deal. ""The ultimate purpose of the Miami Beach Police Department's initial traffic stop was to end some rash juvenile type conduct before a tragedy occurred,"" State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said. ""The intervention and counseling parts of the plea should provide a pathway toward adult responsibility."" Miami Beach Police Chief Raymond Martinez said officers arrested Bieber January 23 after they saw him driving a yellow Lamborghini in a race against a red Ferrari in a residential area. The cars were speeding at about 55 to 60 mph in a 30 mph zone, he said. Police said Bieber was argumentative during the arrest and failed a field sobriety test. Bieber has had a number of run-ins with the law in recent months. In July, a judge in Los Angeles ordered Bieber to pay $80,900 restitution for damaging his former neighbor's mansion by throwing eggs. The pop star accepted a plea deal to settle a vandalism charge that puts him on probation for two years. The probation will be supervised until he completes 12 weekly anger management sessions, works five days of community labor and pays the restitution. He was charged with assault in January after he was accused of hitting his limousine driver in Toronto. In January, the Federal Aviation Administration looked into allegations that Bieber and other passengers on board a charter flight from Canada to New Jersey interfered with the flight crew, the agency said. In July, the FAA cleared them. In February, police in Georgia searched Bieber's limousine and found small amounts of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. No charges were filed ""due to the small amount,"" police said. Bieber, Malala talk online . Bieber v.

39949,"The organisers of the newly-formed European Rugby Champions Cup – formerly the Heineken Cup – have promised to deliver more money for England's Aviva Premiership clubs and a more attractive competition for fans. The popular tournament came perilously close to folding last season following a bitter dispute over the distribution of revenue as English clubs refused to continue under terms they saw as being grossly unfair. Wasps, Saracens, Northampton, Bath, Leicester, Harlequins and Sale will take part in new tournament . The tournament was saved following a carefully negotiated settlement between broadcasters BT Sport and Sky. Bruce Craig - one of the executive directors of the newly slimmed down competition which begins a week on Friday – insists the new deal will see more revenue for England’s top clubs. ‘After 19 years we have now reached a position where the clubs are in control of their financial future,’ he said. ‘We have increased the television money (with BT Sport) by 60 per cent to around £17.4million over four years. That’s a significant uplift on the turnover of last year’s competition.’ Teams from England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales will contest European Rugby Champions Cup . There is a new business model with five prospective sponsorship slots and Craig believes it is a matter of time before more big-name companies join Heineken in backing the tournament. He added: ‘It’s a complicated position because the TV rights weren’t in place. They are now. There's been a lot of interest from a lot of big multi-national companies. We are very confident of bringing in more partners over the next 12 months.’ Tournament organisers are also pushing for an end-of-season clash between the winners of the ERCC and the southern hemisphere’s Super Rugby competition. ‘If we get the approval for it we’re not very far away,’ said Aviva Premiership boss Mark McCafferty. Craig Doyle of BT Sport (left) and Alex Payne of Sky Sports Rugby at the media launch of tournament . ‘It’s always a calendar issue. Personally I don’t think we’re that far off because the public want to see us. The unanswered question at club and provincial level is ‘who is top dog in the world?’ Meanwhile, Bath expect it will take rugby-league convert Sam Burgess at least a fortnight before he is given the all-clear to fly back to England from Australia following surgery on a double facial fracture sustained in Sunday’s NRL Grand Final. Burgess is not expected to play for Bath before Christmas. Bath boss Mike Ford said: ‘He’s come out of surgery. It’s good, it’s gone well. They’re just sitting around figuring out when he can travel. It’s a minimum of two weeks. Just the return to training and taking contact, we haven’t got that date yet.’","The newly-formed European Rugby Champions Cup begins a week on Friday.

33101,"A British science teacher admitted Monday to trying to help anti-Assad regime fighters commit acts of terrorism in Syria. Jamshed Javeed, 30, from the northern English city of Manchester, pleaded guilty to two terrorism charges at Woolwich Crown Court. Police said the father of one had helped four associates travel to Syria for terrorism purposes last year and had planned to join them in the war-torn country. ""He bought equipment for himself and for ISIS fighters to use once he arrived in Syria,"" Greater Manchester Police said in a statement. Javeed's family had grown suspicious of his behavior and confronted him in December, urging him not to go to Syria, but he had said he was committed, police said. Counterterrorism officers arrested Javeed at his home December 21, two days after the confrontation. ""Javeed was an otherwise law-abiding man who had a responsible job, a child and another one on the way,"" Detective Chief Superintendent Tony Mole said. ""However, from August last year both his appearance and behavior started to change and in a short space of time he started to support the ISIS cause and those planning to travel to Syria. ""His family grew suspicious and were clearly intent on stopping him, but he ignored their pleas and told them he was determined to go through with his plans to travel to Syria. He had bought equipment to take with him and had given money to help others travel there,"" Mole said. The case demonstrated the importance of informing authorities early about someone's intentions to join a group such as ISIS, Mole said. Not an extremist, defense says . But Javeed is not an extremist, his defense attorneys said. The defense argued that Javeed was ""deeply moved by the images and reports of the extreme suffering of the Syrian people at the hands of Bashar Al-Assad's vicious regime."" Javeed's actions followed footage of chemical weapons use against civilians in Syria and British Prime Minister David Cameron's failed attempt to get Parliament to approve joining military action against the Assad regime, said a document setting out the basis for the guilty plea. ""It was against this background ... that Jamshed Javeed subsequently came to the conclusion that he should go to support the ordinary people of Syria. He accepts that this would have meant becoming involved in some fighting, as well as humanitarian relief."" The defense said that Javeed did not know he could be prosecuted for making plans to travel to Syria to fight pro-Assad forces and would not have gone if he had known so. Javeed expected to return to his teaching job after returning from Syria. ""He has never supported and does not support the aims of ISIS as now revealed and understood,"" the document said. ""The defendant would not travel to Syria now. There is no coherent rebel force seeking to defeat Assad. He is appalled at the indiscriminate brutality of ISIS."" Javeed is being held in custody for sentencing on December 12. A teacher at high school . Javeed had taught at Sharples High School in Bolton, Greater Manchester. The school teaches students ages 11 to 16. In January, the Bolton News newspaper reported Javeed's arrest. It quoted Sharples head teacher Rachel Quesnel as saying the school was ""working closely with the police to ensure the situation is resolved as quickly as possible."" ""I have taken the decision, along with the chair of governors, to suspend the teacher from his teaching duties in order that a full investigation can take place,"" Quesnel told the paper. ""Please be assured that there is no evidence to suggest that Mr. Javeed's alleged actions are related to his role as teacher at Sharples School, nor is there anything to suggest that our pupils or the wider community have been under any kind of risk.""

82333,"The government called the move the ""largest resettlement programme for children in the world"".
It is in addition to UK prime minister David Cameron's pledge to take 20,000 refugees by 2020.
But critics said it would do nothing to help the thousands of lone Syrian children who had made it to Europe, but were at risk of trafficking and abuse.
The government scheme will target unaccompanied children in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as those considered at risk of abuse and exploitation, such as children threatened with child labour and child marriage. It will resettle children and their families ""where the UNHCR deems resettlement is in the best interests of the child.""
Several hundred people are expected to be resettled in the UK by April 2017 ""with a view to resettling up to 3,000 over the lifetime of this Parliament"", the government said.
The five-year Syrian civil war has created more than 4.5 million refugees across the region - half of them children in need of food, education and a home. The UN has warned that a whole generation of Syrian children is at risk.
Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said:  ""We have always been clear that the vast majority of vulnerable children are better off remaining in host countries in the region so they can be reunited with surviving family members. However, there are exceptional circumstances in which it is in a child's best interests to be resettled in the UK.
""We have engaged with a number of NGOs, including the UNHCR on the best way to provide protection to refugee children and ensure their welfare and safety remain at the heart of every decision made.""
The scheme will be reviewed after two years.
The announcement was welcomed by Children's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield, who said the children would get the ""vital protection and support they need"" in the UK.
But Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of Labour's Refugee Taskforce, said the announcement included ""nothing new to help the thousands of child refugees alone in Europe who are at risk of trafficking, sexual exploitation and abuse"".
""Children are risking their lives every day making dangerous journeys, and Europol estimate at least 10,000 children have disappeared in the crisis, many trafficked into prostitution and modern slavery. Many children are sleeping rough or in makeshift camps because children's homes are full, and many have been sexually abused and exploited too.""
And Lib Dem leader Tim Farron suggested that the move was a ""cynical"" ploy - a bid to ""buy off"" Conservative backbenchers ahead of a Commons vote on the issue of unaccompanied children in the camps      next week.
He told the BBC the announcement would not help the 30,000 unaccompanied children who have made it to Europe already but are at risks in camps:  ""Of those 30,000, 10,000 have gone missing. David Cameron has the ability, should he wish to do so, to step in and prevent these children who are go missing into the hands of child sexual exploiters, human traffickers... And yet once again he's failed to take the opportunity.""
The government has already committed to resettle another 20,000 Syrian refugees under the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme, 1,000 of whom have already arrived, including more than 500 children.","The government has announced plans to resettle up to 3,000 Syrian children in the UK by the end of the year."
83350,"Two men who fell in love are getting married but will be walking down the aisle as brides after both underwent a full sex change operation to become women. Parma Bertoli, 59, and partner Stephanie Nickles, 43, started a relationship back in 2004 when they were still men. Stephanie underwent a full sex change in 2006 after having the procedure funded by the NHS while Parma went under the knife to become a woman in 2008. Scroll down for video... Wedding plans: Parma Bertoli, pictured left, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour, with partner Stephanie Nickles, met when they were both men and hope to tie the knot next month . They couple, who live in Warndon, Worcester, had their birth certificates changed to reflect their new female identities. Next month the couple are preparing to don white dresses for their wedding. However, the couple have been forced to bring the big day forward after Parma was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour last October and was given less than 12 months to live. Parma, a former meat hygiene inspector, said: 'Steph and I got together when we were both men in 2004 and lived together as men. 'Steph was in pre-op so was living as a woman and I made the change soon after. 'Today we are still in love as women. Happy couple: Stephanie, pictured right, said tying the knot would 'make our lives whole' The 43-year-old said she was forced to give up her modelling career to care for Parma . 'To us, gender is not an issue in our relationship. We are just two people who met and tried to help each other along. 'I know I have a very limited amount of time left but it would mean the world to both of us to get married - it would be absolutely brilliant.' The couple got engaged while looking for jewellery in 2009 when Parma suddenly got down on one knee. Stephanie, who has two grown-up children from a previous marriage with whom she has no contact, added: 'We were out browsing commitment rings in a jewellers and when I turned round from a display cabinet I saw Parma down on one knee. 'She just said to me ""will you marry me?"" and of course I said yes. We bought our engagement rings there and then. The staff in the shop clapped, it was a wonderful moment.' But their life together was struck with tragedy when Parma started suffering severe headaches at the beginning of last year. Doctors diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme - an aggressive malignant brain tumour - but despite undergoing surgery she was told it was untreatable. Parma, left, was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme - an aggressive malignant brain tumour - in October last year and was given 12 months to live. The couple have now brought their wedding plans forward . Stephanie said it was a wonderful moment when Parma went down on one knee to propose while shopping . Last October medics at the Gloucestershire Oncology Centre broke the devastating news that she had between 12 and 18 months to live. Stephanie, who gave up her modelling career to care for Parma, said it was a 'struggle every day, not knowing if she is going to wake up'. She added: 'To get married would be such a huge thing for us and would make our lives whole in a way. 'We want to get married because we love each other and we are not sure if Parma will be here next year. 'Be we have not got the funds and we don't even have the money to buy rings.' They couple, who are hoping to get hitched at Worcester registry office next month, are now appealing for help and donations to make their dream wedding come true. Parma added: 'My fiancée has always wanted a special occasion and we are really having to bring it forward because my situation is quite bad. 'I am very lucky to have got this far through the support of my partner.' Parma, who has never been married and has no children, was born Paul Sandford while Stephanie was born John Hart. Appeal:Stephanie, right, has asked for donations from the public to make their 'dream wedding come true' Stephanie said: 'I had previously been married and we had two children. It was a very different life and I have no ties to them now. 'My family would probably want me six-feet under. I started living as a woman because it just felt right. 'I was going through the pre-op procedure when I met Parma but was still a man physically. Parma was also a man but was not pre-op. 'We met via a friend and hit it off immediately. We both loved military history, Parma loves old wartime motorbikes and I love anything to do with the military.' Despite dating for several months in 2004 they couple split up but got back together two years later after they became women. Stephanie added: 'We split up after a third party got involved and went our separate ways. 'I didn't even see Parma again for a couple of years until we bumped into each by chance. 'Strangely, I had gone through the sex change operation and was in London for counselling when I saw Parma waiting in the clinic. 'Our eyes met and I just said to her ""what on earth are you doing here?"" It turned out she was in pre-op and living as a full-time woman. 'It's strange to say it but we technically got together as men but found love as women. 'She took me for a coffee in London and we talked until midnight. We realised then that it was love and we moved in with each other very soon after that. 'We have been inseparable ever since.

5162,"By . Neil Ashton . When Steven Gerrard was in a really bad mood he would go home to his wife Alex and bite her head off. Then it would be the turn of the kids - Lilly-Ella, Lexie and Lourdes - to hear their dad grumbling about his career-threatening groin injury in 2010. On Tuesday, Gerrard spoke of being a better man after private sessions with psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters. Changed: England's Steven Gerrard praised the appointment of psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters to the team staff . ‘I had one-on-one meetings with him,’ revealed Gerrard ahead of Wednesday night’s clash with Denmark at Wembley. ‘I understand the different parts of the brain, how they work, when they function and why you think certain things, why you bite your children’s heads off from time to time, blame Alex for everything - blah, blah, blah.’ There will be scepticism  about Peters’ appointment for the World Cup, but this is a smart move. Endorsement: Gerrard had one-on-one meetings with Peters when going through a groin injury . Desperate: Luke Shaw is keen to make an impression on Roy Hodgson . Neat touch: Wayne Rooney juggles the ball during the training session at Enfield on Monday . Gerrard was brave enough to confront . his demons at a time when he wondered whether he would ever play for . Liverpool or England again. ‘I . had a groin avulsion and it’s a career-threatening injury,’ he said. ‘I’d seen three or four  surgeons and they weren’t really convincing me . that I could play again so I turned to him. 'He helps you with . positivity, the power of thought and staying upbeat, that sort of . stuff.  Without being a drama queen it was a very important stage in my . career. ‘I think it was one . of the  physios at Liverpool who suggested I might need a bit of help . from a psychologist so I said, “Who’s the best?” ‘I was told he was the best.’ Heads up: Jack Wilshere keeps his eye on the ball and will hope to get some game time against Denmark . Something old, something new: It's routine for Wayne Rooney but Luke Shaw is preparing for his England debut . Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge praised Dr Peters in an interview last October as he hit top form for his club. 'Steve had helped a lot in terms of mindset,' he told the Liverpool Echo. 'He's all about self-belief: don't go out there with the mentality of trying to do something, just let it happen.' Dr Peters made Sturridge give himself a mark out of 10 for his Liverpool performances so far. 'Steve told me to say high but I've never been one to be comfortable. I'm uncomfortable getting comfortable. I . think, for my capacity as a footballer, I'd sat a seven out of 10. Probably even six - I'm being kind to myself saying a seven. I can do a . lot better than I'm doing now.' Peters, . who has worked with Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton, was nicknamed . ‘head coach’ when he worked with British Cycling and his book Taming . the Chimp was referred to several times by Gerrard. ‘He just simplifies what’s going on,’ added England’s captain. ‘If you read the book you’ll understand an awful lot more.’ Peters . is employed by Liverpool and has been seconded by the national team for . the World Cup. He will join them before they head to Miami to begin . their tournament preparations at the end of May.

WHO IS DR STEVE PETERS?A consultant psychiatrist and university lecturer who works with elite sports teams and senior management for corporate industries.WHO HAS HE HELPED?Peters's clients include Team GB cyclists such as Sir Bradley Wiggins and Sir Chris Hoy, Ronnie O’Sullivan, Liverpool and England’s 2007 Rugby World Cup squad.WHAT ARE HIS METHODS?Peters works to a principle called ‘The Chimp Paradox’, which says the brain is split into three parts: the rational ‘human’ section, the illogical ‘chimp’ section and a computer for storing information. The way athletes control their ‘chimp’ dictates how well they perform. Put simply, athletes need to control their surges of emotion. HOW DOES IT WORK IN PRACTICE?Peters gets athletes to write down all the problems in their lives leading up to a big competition. For each problem they then have to provide a logical solution to help them deal with it. Peters also warns athletes against setting goals that are beyond their control. For example, footballers should not set a goal of becoming the best footballer in the world because they have no control over what other players will achieve. However, he will tell them to try and be the best they can possibly be and then devise a plan from there.

63283,"Leeds United are one of nine clubs expected to be sanctioned in the next few weeks with transfer bans or fines for over-spending in the Championship - with Leeds having posted losses of £22.9m last season. Queens Park Rangers and Leicester are expected to be hit with massive fines, of around £30m and up to £20m respectively, under Football League financial fair play (FFP) rules, for racking up huge losses in the 2013-14 campaign as they won promotion. Blackburn, Nottingham Forest, Bolton, Bournemouth, Birmingham and Middlesborough as well as Leeds can expect bans of transfer activity in the January window and in some cases beyond if they do not address their financial issues. Massimo Cellino has been deemed unfit to stay in charge of Leeds by the Football League . Under the League’s FFP rules, clubs who overspend and succeed by doing so by reaching the lucrative Premier League are hit with fines - hence QPR and Leicester being hit in the pocket. Leeds’ punishment could be the last of their worries because their 2013-14 accounts, which have not yet been made public, paint an alarming picture of fiscal chaos and uncertainty. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Leeds’s income fell to £25.3m from £28.6m the previous season as gate money, TV money, commercial income and merchandise sales all fell. They made a loss of £20.4m, and a post-tax loss of £22.9m. The accounts contain some alarming numbers, notably that minority shareholders Gulf Finance House, who have a 25 per cent stake, are owed £20.9m by Leeds, and that majority owner Massimo Cellino - currently challenging a League ruling he is unfit to run the club - is owed £12.2m he has injected in 2014 either personally or via companies in London and Italy. Leeds United recorded losses of 22.9m last season and are facing a transfer ban . Cellino, a convicted fraudster, announced last week that he is about to provide £15m in extra funding and that GFH is to put in £5m. But it is understood that GFH won’t actually pay any more money but instead write off a £5m payment Cellino himself is due to make to them on 14 December relating to his buyout. When asked how GFH could be owed more than £20m by Leeds, a GFH spokesman told the Mail on Sunday: ‘As a result of the poor financial situation which they inherited at the club, GFH extended funding of around £20m of cash between July 2012 to November 2013 to keep the club solvent, acquire new players, give new contracts to existing players, pay down existing debt and meet other day to day liabilities as they fell due when the club's revenues were insufficient to do this.’ It is not clear how and when this money was put into the club because the accounts don’t show such an injection. Cellino announced last week that he is going to provide £15m in extra funding to Leeds . One source has suggested if Cellino is forced to relinquish control of Leeds until a tax evasion conviction is spent in March, GFH may temporarily take charge and then hand back the reins. Another source says casino firm Gentings are considering an offer for the club. Both scenarios are ‘speculative, so far’ say club insiders. Another puzzling detail in the accounts is Leeds’s wage bill rising to £22.4m from £20m despite total staff numbers falling from 206 employees to 182, and a decreased playing staff. GFH and related parties also took money from the club in 2013-14 in the form of £2m in interest on loans. They also billed Leeds for £3.4m for unspecified services in the year, although the accounts note those invoices are in dispute. Cellino (centre) watches Leeds play Brentford at Griffin Park back in September . A rise in Leeds’s ‘cost of sales’ (expenses) at a time of falling revenue, as well as almost £2m spent on ‘legal and professional fees’ and ‘management charges’ also show extraordinarily high levels of undetailed spending for what is, in business terms, such a small company. Leeds are unlikely to contest their transfer ban but QPR will almost certainly launch a legal challenge to their fine, expected to be around £30m, calculated via a complex tariff based on losses expected to be around £40m. Monies accrued from the ‘Fair Play Tax’ will go to charity. If QPR refuse to pay and are then relegated, the Football League have already said they will not be re-admitted to their three divisions and would face having to pay up or banishment to the non-league.","Leeds recorded losses of 22.9m last season and are facing bans. Queens Park Rangers and Leicester are expected to be hit with massive fines. Blackburn, Nottingham Forest, Bolton, Bournemouth, Birmingham and Middlesborough can expect bans of transfer activity in the January window and beyond."
93268,"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 10:50 EST, 15 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:51 EST, 15 August 2013 . David C. Jones, a retired Air Force general, has died, aged 92 . David C. Jones, a retired Air Force general who helped set in motion a far-reaching reorganization of the U.S. military command while serving as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has died at 92. The general's son, David Curtis Jones, said yesterday that his father died Saturday at a military retirement community in Potomac Falls, Virginia. He had Parkinson's disease. Jones served longer than any predecessor on the Joint Chiefs, first as the Air Force chief of staff and then as chairman from 1978 to 1982, The New York Times reported. He appeared on the cover of Time magazine in October 1979, with the magazine describing him as 'cool, meticulous, low-key and dogged.' The article said 'Jones typifies the new breed of military managers.' Near the end of his second two-year term, Jones recommended a sweeping reorganization of the nation's military command, moving to strengthen the chairman's role while curbing rivalry among the services. Many of his suggestions were included in the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act, which streamlined the military chain of command. Retired Gen. John Pustay, who served as an assistant to Jones, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Jones was 'a very, very visionary, sharp, perceptive guy — somebody who could always see further down the path than others.' Pustay said Jones helped move the services away from being parochial to a more joint perspective. He said the two stayed in touch, getting together weekly in later years at the military retirement community in northern Virginia where they lived. Under Jones' watch, the Carter administration also undertook a failed attempt to rescue 53 American hostages being held in Iran in 1980. Eight U.S. servicemen died when a helicopter crashed into a C-130 transport plane at a staging area in Iran. 'He was really devastated about that,' said Jones' daughter, Kathy Franklin of Silver Spring, Md. Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger (pictured right) and Air Force General David C. Jones (left), on Capitol Hill in Washington in March, 1981 . She said that while Jones understood that unexpected bad weather was a factor, he also felt that the rescue attempt was impaired by the lack of a joint command to train and exercise forces for such missions. 'That propelled a lot of his passion for Goldwater-Nichols...creating more joint connections in the military,' she said. David Charles Jones was born in Aberdeen, S.D., in 1921. After the family moved to Minot, N.D., he often rode his bicycle to a nearby airfield and dreamed of becoming a pilot. He attended the University of North Dakota and Minot State College, dropping out during World War II to enlist in the Army Air Corps. He received his commission and pilot wings in February 1943, then trained pilots at air bases in the U.S. During the Korean War, he flew more than 300 B-29 bomber missions over North Korea and also flew aerial tankers for midair refueling. After the war, he served for two years as a top aide to Gen. Curtis LeMay, an architect of U.S. air attacks during World War II and then the commander of the Strategic Air Command. In 1960, Jones graduated from the National War College. Four years later, he decided at age 43 that he wanted to learn to fly fighters. 'He did better than some of the young guys in his class and he got a wing,' said Franklin, who also noted that her father rose from colonel to four-star general in 5 ½ years. CIA Director William Colby (left), and other attendees of a top-secret National Security Council meeting are shown military options by General David Jones relating to the capture of the SS Mayaguez in May, 1975 in Washington DC . Franklin described her father as a self-made man who read voraciously, particularly about management, and managed to become Joint Chiefs chairman despite having not graduated from college or one of the service academies. 'This was rather unheard-of,' she said. According to the Air Force website, Jones served in Vietnam as deputy commander for operations and then as vice commander of the Seventh Air Force. He later commanded U.S. Air Forces in Europe, receiving a fourth star in 1971. Three years later, President Richard Nixon tapped Jones to be Air Force chief of staff. He led a reorganization of the command structure. President Jimmy Carter appointed Jones as Joint Chiefs chairman in 1978 and again in 1980. Jones accompanied Carter to Vienna for SALT II talks with the Soviet Union in 1979, and after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, helped transform a rapid deployment force for southwest Asia that Carter established into a regional unified command. According to The Times, some Republican senators criticized Jones for publicly backing Carter's cancellation of the B-1 bomber, among other policies. But Jones said he felt he had a constitutional obligation to support civilian superiors publicly even if he offered different advice in private. Still, Franklin said, 'He really loved working with President Carter.' She also has more personal memories of her father, such as when the legendary World War II general Omar Bradley was in a wheelchair and 'my dad took him all around the Pentagon when he was chairman.' Jones' son David said he was in high school when his father was Joint Chiefs chairman, but that his father put family first. 'We did so much together,' recalled the younger Jones, of Sterling, Va. 'Every moment he had he was not at work, he'd devote to family.' He recalled his father being 'extremely honest' and 'larger than life' to him. Jones completed his second term as Joint Chiefs chairman during the Reagan administration, and retired from the military in July 1982. Jones was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the board of the American Red Cross. He also served on the boards of General Electric and Youth Service, USA, Inc., and was on the Council on Foreign Relations. Jones' wife of 67 years, Lois, died in 2009 . In addition to Franklin and David Jones, the general is survived by a daughter, Susan Coffin of Scottsdale, Ariz., a sister, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Burial will be at Arlington National Cemetery.","David C. Jones, 92, died Saturday at a military retirement community in Potomac Falls, Virginia.

All manner of wizened political and business leaders are attending this year's event. Rupert Murdoch, the 82-year-old chairman and CEO of News Corp, has been pictured with both of his sons. Also in attendance are Berkshire Hathaway founder Warren Buffett, also 82 and ranked as the fourth richest man in the world; New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, 71; and Phil Knight, the 72-year-old founder of Nike. But it's the young, hip - and significantly dressed-down - tech executives who have become the center of attention at the Idaho mountain resort this week. The hoodie CEO: Billionaire Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, seen here with wife Priscilla, is famous for wearing casual clothes instead of a suit and tie . Nothing to prove: Ben Silbermann, left, the CEO and co-founder of Pinterest, and David Ebersman, CFO of Facebook, didn't seem too worried about their appearance at Sun Valley resort in Idaho on Tuesday . Brian Grazer, left, a film and television produce and founder of Imagine Entertainment is seen with a coat tied around his waist. Pictured also are his girlfriend Veronica Smiley, Kate Greer and, seen right, Jack Dorsey, creator of Twitter . The new cohort of Silicon Valley power brokers is led by Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, 29, and his wife Priscilla Chan. Other notable figures include Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, 36, Pinterest founder Ben Silbermann, 30, and YouTube CEO Salar Kamangar, 35. These new 'masters of the universe' seem to have a few things in common. They're coders by trade. They made their careers by writing computer programs and working on the technical side of Silicon Valley. They're all insanely rich. Zuckerberg has a $13.1billion fortune. Dorsey is worth $1.1billion. Kamangar was the sixth employee every hired at Google. And none of them seem to dress the part. Highly powerful and super rich - they prefer unassuming t-shirts and jeans to a suit and tie. Billions of dollars in wealth and hardly a collar in sight. Zuckerberg has famously led the way in this trend with his insistence on wearing a hooded sweatshirt - even to some powerful business meetings. He did not deviate from his fashion trend at Sun Valley, either. While his new wife Priscilla Chan looked lovely in a white blouse and scarf, Zuckerberg sported a black hoodie and jeans. Selbermann - whose Pinterest social networking site has nearly 50million users and was valued at $1.5billion last year - was pictured in an ill-fitting grey t-shirt.

He was seen with on-again-off-again girlfriend Kate Greer wearing a leather jacket, cowboy boots and a simple t-shirt tucked into his jeans. Despite their geeky appearances, these tech gurus have become some of Sun Valley's most powerful voices. TheWrap, a Hollywood news site, reports that the heads of major content producing companies like Murdoch, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes and Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai are lining up to speak with the young tech executives. Zuckerberg rocks another popular look of his - the tight-fitting t-shirt - during a lunch break at the Sun Valley Conference on Wednesday . Zuckerber is seen here with Patrick Collison, a 24-year-old Irish scientist and software designer who became a millionaire at age 19 after selling his idea . News Corp founder Rupert Murdoch and Microsoft founder Bill Gates were among the the older billionaires in attendance at Sun Valley . These old-media power players see Zuckerberg and social media leaders as the best way to market their movies and television shows in a world where more and more young people are getting their entertainment online. Other executives like YouTube's Kamangar and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, 52, are also in demands because they control the delivery methods for content. Tens of millions of users stream movies and shows online through Netflix and YouTube. Those companies, though, need to hammer out agreements with the content producers in order for their businesses to grow. Sun Valley, afterall, was founded as place where the world's most powerful men and women could gather to rub elbows - and hammer out major business deals.","Allen and Company's Sun Valley Conference is called the 'summer camp for billionaires' and it lives up to the name.

76226,"The homes of DFB President Wolfgang Niersbach, his predecessor Theo Zwanziger, and former Secretary General Horst Schmid, were also searched.
It follows reports that a secret â‚¬6.7m (Â£4.9m) fund was set up to secure votes for Germany to host the 2006 World Cup.
The DFB denied the claims last month.
It said on Tuesday that documents were seized during the raid and that it was fully co-operating with the investigation.
About 50 officers and tax inspectors swooped in on the DFB headquarters and the homes of the three senior officials.
In a statement, the prosecutor's office said it had opened a probe into claims of serious tax evasion linked to the awarding of the World Cup to Germany in 2006.
It said it was investigating the alleged transfer of â‚¬6.7m from ""the organising committee for the DFB to the Fifa football association"".
Mr Niersbach has denied the allegations, claiming instead that the sum was used to secure larger Fifa funding.
He said the deal was agreed at a private meeting between suspended Fifa President Sepp Blatter and Franz Beckenbauer, the president of the organising committee for the 2006 World Cup.
But, speaking to Der Spiegel news weekly, Mr Zwanziger accused his successor of lying, saying it was ""clear that a slush fund existed"".
Mr Beckenbauer said last week he had made a ""mistake"" in the bidding process in 2000 to host the 2006 World Cup, but denied that votes were bought.
A former World Cup-winning captain and ex-Germany coach, Mr Beckenbauer instead supported Mr Niersbach's claim that a payment was used to unlock Fifa subsidies.
""In order to receive a financial subsidy from Fifa, it was agreed to accept a recommendation from Fifa's finance committee, which from today's perspective, should have been rejected,"" he said.

In its report in October, Der Spiegel said the DFB fund to buy votes was set up using money loaned by late Adidas boss Robert Louis-Dreyfus.
Fifa said it would investigate the ""serious allegations"".
World football's governing body has for months been engulfed by the biggest corruption scandal in its history.
In May, 14 football officials and sports marketing executives were indicted by the US Department of Justice on charges of ""rampant, systemic, and deep-rooted"" corruption.
Meanwhile, a separate Swiss investigation began looking into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, which will be held in Russia and Qatar respectively.
Then, last month, Fifa's outgoing President Blatter, 79, was provisionally suspended, along with Secretary General Jerome Valcke and Vice-President Michel Platini, amid further allegations of corruption.
Mr Blatter is under investigation by Swiss prosecutors over allegations that he signed a contract that was ""unfavourable to Fifa"" and made a ""disloyal payment"" to Mr Platini, also head of European football's governing body, Uefa.",The headquarters of the German Football Federation (DFB) and the homes of three senior officials have been searched by German prosecutors.

Speaking out: Miami Dolphins tackle Jonathan Martin told NBC he felt 'trapped' in the team's locker room . 'I wish I would have had more tools to solve my situation. I felt trapped, like I didn't have a way to make it right. It came down to a point where I thought it was best to remove myself from the situation.' While he said that he understood hazing went on within teams - and was supportive of 'pranks' - he felt that it was more personal in his case. 'Comments of racial nature,' he said. 'Aggressive, sexual comments related to my sister and my mother... I don't think there's any place for that. 'I've spoken to former teammates in locker rooms across he NFL and asked, ""Does this stuff go on?"" and the consensus was this was not normal.'

Suspended: Miami Dolphins Guard Richie Incognito (right) was accused of bullying his fellow teammates in the bullying scandal and was suspended from eight games. He said he doubts he will return to the Dolphins . 'I have an idea what will be in it,' Ross said Tuesday. 'I haven't seen the report. I don't know exactly what . his conclusion is. When it comes out, we'll do what has to be done. 'In . my mind, I know what direction we're going. ...

Wells' report is expected to address the . roles of coaches and staff in the case. One issue is whether anyone on . the coaching staff ordered Incognito to toughen up Martin. The case inspired a national debate about workplace bullying. Incognito, who is white, confirmed that he had left an expletive-ridden message on Martin's voicemail, making racial slurs and saying he wanted to defecate in his teammate's mouth. 'Hey, wassup, you half n***** piece of [expletive],' he said in the message. 'I saw you on Twitter, you been training ten weeks. Martin left the Dolphins after being allegedly harassed by teammate Richie Incognito . '[I want to] [expletive] in your . [expletive] mouth. [I'm going to] slap your [expletive] mouth. [I'm . going to] slap your real mother across the face (laughter). [Expletive] . you, you’re still a rookie. I’ll kill you.' Incognito later said he was embarrassed about the voicemail, but insisted it was not malicious. 'I'm . embarrassed by my actions,' he told Fox Sports. 'I understand why a lot . of eyebrows get raised, but people don’t know how Jon and I communicate . to one another.' Incognito becomes a free agent this winter. When asked if he or the 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin will play for the Dolphins again, Ross equivocated.

She had starred in a commercial for the group where she spells out 'Jesus' with tennis balls and tells people not to be ashamed of their faith. Senior Catholic priest Father Marek Dziewiecki said: 'It's a shame that someone who has declared their love for Jesus is now promoting the mentality of men looking at a woman as a thing rather than a child of God worthy of respect and love. 'If she meets a man who she can truly love and establish a happy family and raise Catholic children, then she would probably have to hide these pictures from relatives.'

21915,"Jonathan Schwartz admitted stealing $5m (Â£3.9m) from Morissette between 2010 and 2014 and $2m (Â£1.6m) from five other unnamed clients.
Morissette testified in Los Angeles on Wednesday, saying he ""not only stole $5m in cash from me, he stole a dream"".
Judge Dolly Gee exceeded the 63-month sentence requested by prosecutors.
""In the past I've criticised the sentencing guidelines as draconian, but this is a rare instance in which I feel they're not harsh enough,"" she said, according to Variety.
Morissette, who made her name in 1995 with the album Jagged Little Pill, told the court her ability to trust ""has been shaken to the core"" by Schwartz's deception.
She recalled how he would burst into tears when she confronted him about her finances, ""taking advantage of my empathic nature"".
He covered his tracks by telling other associates she had irresponsible spending habits, claiming she built recording studios and bought houses against his advice.
""I'd go on tours he recommended and they would lose money, but he'd still urge me to spend! Spend! Spend! He was creating an alibi from the start,"" she said.
Schwartz, 47, pled guilty in January to wire fraud and falsifying federal tax returns.
He wrote an open letter in The Hollywood Reporter last month, saying he was a gambling addict and turned to drugs to deal with the stress of the job.
He wrote: ""At first, I 'borrowed' a little from clients, with the hopes that I would pay them back if I won that night's bet. That snowballed, and as I kept losing, I kept stealing.""
He added: ""I let everybody down, and for that I will spend the rest of my life asking for forgiveness and making amends to everyone I have hurt.""
His attorney had requested a sentence of 12 months and a day of prison and 12 months home detention, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
But Judge Dolly Gee handed down a much harsher penalty, concluding he was motivated by ""greed"" and a desire to live beyond his means.

Charlotte Downes, 14, vanished in 2003 after being groomed by a child sex gang in Blackpool, and her body has never been found. Police believe that she was murdered, and it has been claimed her body was chopped up for kebab meat. Agony: Karen Downes, 48, (right) says sick internet trolls posted abuse on a website dedicated to the memory of her murdered daughter Charlene, 14 (left) The teenager's mother Karen, 48, has revealed how a page on an internet site dedicated to Charlene has been bombarded with sickening messages. They include claims that Mrs Downes and her husband Rob, 52, were partly responsible for their daughter’s death. 'There are a lot of evil people, saddos and weirdos on Facebook making up all kinds of filth,' said Mrs Downes. 'It is all hearsay and lies. I’ve had people threatening to come round to my house and beat me up. 'I informed the police. 'It is bad enough Charlene is not around without people making up this disgusting stuff. 'They won’t come and say it to your face, so they say it over the internet and I just want it to stop. Charlene will never be forgotten, but we need closure.' Mrs Downes said messages were left on the social networking site accusing her and her husband of allowing Charlene to be abused, claims they have always denied. It is the first time she has spoken out since cold-case detectives from Lancashire police re-opened the case in November, 10 years after Charlene disappeared. 'Hearsay and lies': The posts include claims that Mrs Downes and husband Rob, 52, (left) were partly responsible for their daughter¿s death . At the time she vanished, the teenager was believed to have been one of a group of girls being groomed for sex with cash, gifts and booze.Detectives said Charlene may have been abused by up to 100 men. In 2007, two Blackpool takeaway shop owners were charged with Charlene’s murder. Prosecutors claimed, based on secret recordings, that her body was chopped into bits and used for kebabs. However, the first jury failed to reach a verdict. A retrial was scrapped and the men cleared because witnesses and the police’s recorded evidence were 'unreliable'. 'It is bad enough Charlene is not around without people making up this disgusting stuff' Karen Downes . The defendants, business partners Iyad Albattikhi and Mohammed Reveshi, later received six-figure compensation payouts for false imprisonment. Mrs Downes had hoped to launch a civil prosecution against them, but said she could not afford to hire lawyers to help her. 'The cost of a solicitor will be about £6,000 to start with,' she said. 'I haven’t got that kind of money. I’m upset and devastated, but what can I say. I’ve just got to live with it.' She also hit out at the police, saying the family has had little support, a claim they have denied. 'Since the case collapsed in 2008, all the police have done is fobbed me off and gone through the same things over and over again,' said Mrs Downes. 'They said the case had been re-opened in November but then they said it has never been closed. 'It can’t be both. 'I’m so mad. I do not have any faith in the police at all. 'I just hope and pray the police help us but they just don’t seem to want to know.' A spokesman for Lancashire Police said cold-case detectives met the Downes family on February 18 and said a family liaison officer had been in contact as recently as last week.

28609,"By . Tara Brady . A husband has been left penniless after his dying wife secretly ran up £48,000 in debts to fritter away before she died. Devastated Lenny Walters, 56, discovered his wife Joyce had forged his signature twice to add cash to their joint mortgage. She died months after she confessed to the loans, forcing her husband of 29 years to sell the family home where they had lived for more than three decades, to cover the debt. Lenny Walters discovered his wife Joyce had forged his signature twice to add cash to their mortgage . Lenny Walters and wife Joyce Walters taken in 2000. Joyce died months after confessing to the loans . Fishmonger Lenny admitted he could not forgive or forget her betrayal despite the fact the love of his life was on her death bed. He said: 'Words cannot describe the pain I felt when the full scale of her betrayal unfolded. 'Even as she was dying, I couldn’t accept her apology. It was the worst moment of my life. Joyce was well loved in our community and I trusted her implicitly. 'To think she could do this to me was beyond comprehension. We’d been together for 33 years. 'This is a woman I shared half of my life with, who I thought I knew inside out and who I trusted implicitly. 'To think she could steal from me with such ease is hard to get my head round. I couldn’t bring myself to forgive her even though she was dying of cancer.' Lenny believed they were close to paying off the £30,000 mortgage on their three-bed, semi-detached in Pembrokeshire, when his wife was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2007. Joyce, 56, whose condition was terminal, underwent chemotherapy in a bid to prolong her life but the cancer had also spread into her bone and brain. Lenny Walters and wife Joyce Walters taken in late 1990s. The couple had been married for 33 years . Photograph of Joyce Walters taken in 1980s: Her husband Lenny said he could not forgive her . Heartbroken Lenny decided to inform their provider Lloyds Bank as the couple had a joint account, although Joyce organised the mortgage repayments, which cost £350-a-month. However, on the day of Lenny’s trip to the bank he received a bombshell text from Joyce admitting to her deceit, before she fled to live with her niece in Surrey. Lenny said: 'Looking back, I think she knew what was coming. Finding out about the cancer was hard enough. 'I loved her just as much as the first day I met her and the thought of living without her was enough to kill me too. 'But when she dropped the bombshell about what she’d been up to at the bank. I was crushed. She texted me and confessed to re-mortgaging the property. 'I had no idea what was going on and couldn’t get any sense from Lloyds because she’d also changed our address, so the one I gave them wasn’t on their system. 'She told me she wouldn’t be coming back - that was it. She was dying and I’d have to fix this mess.'Lenny, who has a daughter, Katy, with Joyce, was showed statements that proved the property had been remortgaged in 2004 - adding a loan of £18,000. Joyce informed the bank that they had moved to a different address - which was actually the address of the resource centre where she worked. In May 2007, six months before she was diagnosed with cancer, she arranged a further £30,000 loan with Lloyds, secured against the value of the property. Lenny Walters, 62, a fishmonger from Milford Haven whose late wife remortgaged his house without his knowledge. Also pictured is his daughter Katy Walters, 33 . Despite the large value of the loan, no one queried that she had put a different address on her application form to their home address. When Lenny confronted his dying wife she confessed and even admitted that she 'fully expected to be pulled in [by police] for fraud', though she never was. A month latter Lenny received a letter from his heavily-medicated wife, reading: 'I know you must hate me, and who can blame you. 'You are a hard-working man, loving, kind and heart of gold. You made me a very happy woman and now I have lost you all because of money. 'This is all my fault not yours. I was spending far too much and it got out of control and I just didn’t know how to get out of it. I didn’t spend it on anything any good either. What a waste. 'I have nothing now. I am in the fight of my life with the cancer, and for the first time in my life I have never ever felt so alone.' In spite of the letter Lenny said he was unable to forgive his wife, who died five months after sending the apology. In April 2012, Lloyds Bank took Lenny to court in order to try to repossess the house. Lenny argued that he should not be penalised because of his wife’s actions because the bank should have been more vigilant in their checks. But despite accepting that he had nothing to do with the fraudulent activity, the bank will not accept any liability in the matter and are determined to recoup the money by forcing him to sell his property. He added: 'They want me to put the house up for auction with a reserve price of £45,000 for a quick sale. 'If I agree, they’ll also refund £3,000 for mis-sold PPI. 'I’ve already spent £10,000 of savings in legal fees but I’ll fight them to the bitter end to keep my home. I haven’t put it up for auction but it is on the market for £60,000. 'There are a lot of unanswered questions, like how she saw the same bank manager 14 times in the space of three years without me being present and how no one thought to query that she gave an address different to the home address. 'I’ve had years of stress fighting this case and, as far as I’m concerned, Lloyds need to be made answerable for their errors and lack of due diligence. 'The money I’d get from the house sale will be negligible. Lenny Walters said he is devastated that the woman he loved left him in such a financial mess . 'After spending 30 years of my life paying off a house, I’ll be forced to rent again, back to square one. 'I’ve always done the right thing and paid my way in life. I don’t think I should be penalised for my wife’s actions and Lloyds’ negligence. 'But the bank don’t care about my pain and distress and the fact that they are making me homeless. All they care about is recovering their money. They are completely heartless. 'And as for Joyce, I’m not sure I’ll ever understand how or why she could do this. I’m devastated that the woman I loved has left me this way.' A spokesman for Lloyds said: 'We are aware of Mr Walters’ case and are working with the customer to help reach a resolution. 'As discussions are still ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment in further detail about the case at this stage.'","Lenny Walters discovered his wife Joyce had forged his signature twice.

72114,"The court said it first needed to consider arguments whether the 9 November vote breached the country's constitution.
It acted on a request from the Spanish central government in Madrid.
The leader of Catalonia, Artur Mas, signed a decree on Saturday calling for the referendum. Many in the wealthy north-eastern Spanish region back him.
But Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy told reporters that the vote was not ""compatible with the Spanish constitution"".
""Nobody and nothing will be allowed to break up Spain.""
He was speaking in a televised statement to the nation after holding an emergency cabinet meeting.
Hundreds of thousands of Catalans joined a protest in Barcelona recently, calling for their right to vote.
Unhappy at Spain's refusal to give Catalans more powers, protesters have been energised by Scotland's recent independence referendum, and many also waved the Scottish flag.
Catalonia's 7.5 million inhabitants make up approximately 16 % of the population of Spain. Yet it is one of Spain's richest and most highly industrialised regions, as well as one of its most independent-minded.
Spain's deepening economic crisis, though, has seen a surge in support for separation.
On 11 September a vast crowd rallied in support of independence in Barcelona, as Catalonia marked ""La Diada"", the 300th anniversary of the end of the city's siege.
Then on 19 September the regional parliament voted by 106 to 28 in favour of granting Catalonia's president the power to hold a referendum, known locally as a ""consultation"".
Mr Mas, who was re-elected in December 2012, says he can use local laws to hold the vote, even though the central government says its blessing is required.
""I can't pretend that this will be easy, but it doesn't work just coming out to protest once a year,"" Mr Mas said on Catalan television at the weekend.
""The future is something you conquer, not a gift, and we have to earn that,"" he added.
A recent poll for Spain's El Pais newspaper showed that 45% of Catalans were in favour of suspending the referendum if the Constitutional Court declared it illegal.
Only 23% would like the referendum to go ahead regardless, the survey suggested.
Mr Mas has only recently become a supporter of full independence. Since 2007, he has spearheaded a push to revitalise Catalan nationalism known as the Refoundation of Catalanism.",The Spanish Constitutional Court has suspended a referendum on Catalonia's independence from Spain if it finds it illegal.
80726,"U.S. President Barack Obama delivers remarks about the launch of the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces . As many as 11 million employees of small businesses in the U.S. face paying more for health insurance under Obamacare, according to a new report into the controversial healthcare bill. The estimate, provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services (CMS), part of the Department of Health and Human Services, also projected that 6 million others face lower rates for health insurance. The report says that this is due to the to the laws requirement that premiums for health insurance can no longer be based on an insurance applicant's age. This means that while older people's premiums are going down, younger people's are going to rise. While the estimate is far from certain, because many small businesses renewed their insurance policies in 2013. Because they renewed before 2014, they were allowed to avoid higher premiums that went into effect, when insurance coverage was required to conform to the new law, on January 1. The estimate is also affected by the report only looking at three specific provisions of the Affordable Care Act. In actuality, employers decisions will be based on more than just three factors, according to information from the CMS. The news that premiums could increase for 11 million could be good news for the Republican party, who have made anti-Obamacare campaigning their number one priority and policy. Obamacare has been rife with problems ever since it was signed into law in March 2010. A typical U.S. insurance site, that allows citizens to sign up for medical and health insurance. Under Obamacare, the rules that exist to help them sign up are different in a way that tries to benefit those on lower incomes . Public polls suggest that the U.S. citizenship generally support Obamacare, but recent and frequent damaging mistakes and errors in its implementation have given the Republican party, who strongly oppose the legislation, ammo against it in their campaigns. Recently, errors in signing up to Obamacare using the website was fraught with error, as the site appeared to be repeatedly broken, prompting people to have to use the mobile site if they wanted to sign up. This, combined with low turnout for signing up in states such as Oregon, which signed up only 33, 808 instead of a projected 146,940, has given the public pause for thought when decided where their allegiances lie. However, despite these mistakes, many governors, both Republican and Democrats . alike, have come to the conclusion that 'Obamacare is here to stay' taking a more 'pragmatic view' of the healthcare legislation. 'We're . just trying to make the best of a bad situation' said Republican Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, who called the health care law 'unaffordable and . unsustainable'. Representative Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado, displays an advertisement from the Thanks Obamacare campaign, an anti-obamacare campaign. Republicans have been widely critical of the new healthcare legislation . He said: 'We're trying to make it work as best we can for the people of Iowa.' Governor Bobby Jindal of Louisiana said: 'I don't think that it's so deeply entrenched that it can't be repealed.' 'But I do think, as we argue for repeal, we have to show folks what you replace it with.' However, . despite a troubled introduction, nearly 3.3 million people have signed . up by February 1 for health care coverage under the law. In addition, the White House reported that 1 million people signed up nationwide for private insurance under the law in January alone. But it still remains unclear whether the administration will reach its unofficial goal of 7 million people by the end of March. 'Obamacare' is the name given to . the Patient Care and Affordable Health Act, legislation that is an . attempt to make healthcare in the U.S, which can often be very . expensive, affordable for those on lower incomes. Healthcare in the U.S. is based around the purchase of health insurance, which, before now, was able to make it expensive for people, or even deny people their services on the basis of factors like age or pre-existing medical conditions. Without medical insurance, citizens in the U.S. have to pay for their own medical care which can be incredibly expensive (a single hospital visit can cost $1,265). A few basic rules under the act are: .","11 million small business employees face paying more for health insurance. This is due to the law that no longer based on an applicant's age. This means that while older people's premiums are going down, younger people's are going up."

Which is a little like beating up a statue, but still... Students have come unhinged over a plan to triple university fees. The government says it had to approve the increase to fight soaring budget problems. Americans are, of course, quite different from the Brits in many ways. But our young people certainly have this in common: Here, as there, tuition rates have steadily risen, job opportunities for graduates have grown more scarce, and the prospects of maintaining the ""good life"" so many younger folks enjoy now have dimmed. And history has shown time and again, that when young people get upset they have a nasty tendency to take it to the streets. Which has me wondering if maybe we're setting the stage for similar unrest here on the American side of the pond. We have a deficit problem.

""You need to get out of here, right now!"" a shop owner shouted at me shortly after the mob sacked his place. ""You're going to get killed."" More than 50 people were killed. Hundreds of others were hurt. It was fascinating, especially the guy I saw carrying a looted refrigerator from Sears entirely on his own, but it was also dangerous, destructive, and in the end, pointless. Note to potential rampagers: Wrecking your own neighborhood does little to improve the conditions that made you mad in the first place. That said, however, circumstances now appear favorable for some sort of similar outbreak of mob violence, given the right catalyst. First, unemployment is high. When people lose their paychecks, they get irritable. Combine the frustration of these folks with a job market that stubbornly refuses to give them any hope and you can see how fear of long-term joblessness can turn into anger","David Frum: London riots, university fees, other protests could spark similar unrest. He says U.S. has a deficit problem, cuts of services, tax hikes, but it's easy to get angry. He says rioters can get angry if job market doesn't give them any hope. Frum: U.S. needs to act quickly to deal with problems, not just retaliate."
47319,"Production fell 1.1% in September from the previous month, the country's statistics agency Destatis said.
The fall was a surprise, with some economists expecting industrial output to rise.
A slowdown in some emerging markets had weighed production down, Germany's economy ministry said.
""After a good development in the first half, German industry is currently experiencing a light headwind from the world economy, in particular due to a slowdown in some large emerging markets,"" the ministry said.
In a three-month comparison, factories produced 0.3% fewer goods in the July-to-September period, with an increase in construction not fully offsetting a fall in manufacturing output.
Ulrike Kastens, an economist at Sal Oppenheim bank, said the data suggested that the economy could not rely on industry to support growth as it heads into the final quarter.
""In view of the problems in emerging markets, it's hard for us to imagine where a quick rebound for German industry should come from,"" she said.","Germany's manufacturing output fell by 1.1% in September, a sharp fall from the previous month."
13368,"PUBLISHED: . 12:22 EST, 1 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:23 EST, 1 March 2013 . Nasa's Curiosity rover has developed a major computer problem on Mars. Engineers have been forced to suspend the rover's work while they attempt to restore a corrupted computer. The team said the rover had been placed in a 'safe mode' to protect it. Help! The last self portrait the rover sent back before it developed a major computer fault . The intentional swap put the rover, as anticipated, into what what engineers said was a minimal-activity precautionary status called 'safe mode.' The team is shifting the rover from safe mode to operational status over the next few days and is troubleshooting the condition that affected operations yesterday, Nasa said. The condition is related to a glitch in flash memory linked to the other, now-inactive, computer. 'We switched computers to get to a standard state from which to begin restoring routine operations,' said Richard Cook of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, project manager for the Mars Science Laboratory Project, which built and operates Curiosity. A Picasso-like self portrait of NASA's Curiosity rover was taken by its Navigation cameras, located on the now-upright mast. Curiosity carries a pair of redundant main computers in order to have a backup available if one fails. Each of the computers, A-side and B-side, also has other redundant subsystems linked to just that computer. Curiosity is now operating on its B-side, as it did during part of the flight from Earth to Mars. It operated on its A-side from before the August 2012 landing through Wednesday. 'While we are resuming operations on the B-side, we are also working to determine the best way to restore the A-side as a viable backup,' said JPL engineer Magdy Bareh, leader of the mission's anomaly resolution team. The spacecraft remained in communications at all scheduled communication windows on Wednesday, but it did not send recorded data, only current status information. The status information revealed that the computer had not switched to the usual daily 'sleep' mode when planned. Diagnostic work in a testing simulation at JPL indicates the situation involved corrupted memory at an A-side memory location used for addressing memory files. Scientific investigations by the rover have been suspended. Resumption of science investigations is anticipated within several days,' said Nasa. Earlier this week, laboratory instruments inside the rover have been analyzing portions of the first sample of rock powder ever collected from the interior of a rock on Mars.",NASA's Curiosity rover has developed a major computer fault.

95099,"A prceless horde of artefacts has been recovered from the site of the first ancient naval battle ever discovered. The find - including helmets, weapons and ancient bronze battle rams - has been rescued from the seabed off the Sicilian coast where they had lain undisturbed for more than 2,000 years. They are the remnants of The Battle of the Egadi Islands - the last clash from the first Punic War - which pitted the Romans against their enemies the Carthagnians and propelled the Romans to Europe-wide domination. Turn back time: Researchers study a rusted helmet that was discovered in the depths of the sea . It looks a little battered! The remnants of a battering ram were amongst the horde of artefacts found . A tablewear jug (left) and amphora-bottle (right) were rescued from the seabed off the Sicilian coast where they had laid for more than 2,000 years . Experts say the finds - which were scattered over some five kilometres and submerged beneath up to 100 metres of sea - represent the first ancient naval battle site ever discovered. British archaeologists hailed the find a 'major discovery' and are now leading the efforts to survey every inch of the nautical battlefield. Jon Henderson, an underwater archaeologist at the University of Nottingham, has been using cutting edge technology aboard a ship aptly titled Hercules to survey the battlefield. He said: 'There has never been an ancient whole battle site discovered before, which is quite surprising when you consider how important sea power is in the Mediterranean. 'It is a major discovery. This is the first major naval battle between the Romans and the Carthagnians. Because the Romans won they were set on the road to Empire and control of the Mediterranean. 'The historical significance is huge, but what is so important is that we are finding battle sites because of changes in underwater technology. 'We are at the cusp of an exciting range of new discoveries.' The finds, including this anchor, were scattered over some five kilometres and submerged beneath up to 100 metres of sea . British archaeologists hailed the find a 'major discovery' and are now leading the efforts to comb the seabed for more . On March 10th, 241BC, the two ancient heavyweights clashed in a huge naval battle off the coast of Sicily. The two powers had been warring for more than 20 years, as the Romans battled for a foothold in the all-important Mediterranean sea. While the Carthagnians were much more powerful on the water, the cunning Romans lay in wait trapping the Carthaginians and blocking off their sea route in a sudden victorious attack. Up to 50 Carthagnian ships were sunk in the bloody attack, killing up to 10,000 men. Around 70 more ships were captured along with their crews, while the rest fled. A project to find the lost battlefield was set up 10 years ago by the Soprintendenza del Mare in Italy and RPM Nautical Foundation. But underwater mapping of the battlefield has just begun. The project has already uncovered some prized artefacts. So far some 11 bronze battering rams used by ships to pummel each other have been fished out of the water, along with bronze helmets and armour. Dr Jon Henderson has been using cutting edge technology aboard a ship to survey the ancient battlefield . So far researchers aboard the ship have found some 11 bronze battering rams used by ships to pummel each other have been fished out of the water, along with bronze helmets and armour . The Battle of the Aegates Islands in 241 BC was a naval battle fought between the fleets of Carthage and the Roman Republic during the First Punic War. It was a victory for the Romans that would lead to their domination in the years to come.Rome lacked a fleet — the ships it had possessed had been destroyed in a previous battle. Yet their enemies, the Carthaginian forces, did little to capitalise on this, allowing Rome to restore its strength and build a new stronger fleet. When the Carthaganians heard about this, they prepared their fleet for battle, and sailed to the Aegates Islands. The Romans sailed out to meet them - but not before stripping their vessels of sails and masts to give them an advantage in rough sea conditions, . By ramming into their enemy's ships and destroying half of the fleet, the Romans won a decisive victory. It was the last battle in the First Punic War, which had raged for 20 years as the two powers fought for supremacy over the western Mediterranean Sea. Dr Henderson said: 'Prior to this project just three bronze rams were known to exist in the whole Mediterranean, and now we have 11, so it is a major change in terms of the amount of physical information we now have about this battle. 'Some scholars had thought that ships were no longer ramming each other and that the rams were just for show. 'But we have found bits of the enemy ships in some of the rams so it's very likely they were ramming each other.' Experts plan to cast the rams and use them to reconstruct what the ancient ships would look like. Archaeologists had spent years scouring the shallow waters off the island of Levanzo, just west of Sicily, searching for the infamous battlefield. But they only finally discovered the site after hearing stories told by old Sicilian divers that ancient lead anchors were lying on the seabed, off the Egadi Islands. Professor of pre-history and Soprintendenza del Mare, Professor Tusa said: 'The stories these divers told led me to speculate where this battle might have taken place. 'To prove my hypothesis I carried out a series of dives and discovered 50 anchors. Local fishermen brought up a bronze helmet from the same area and together with the discovery of the first ram my hypothesis became theory.' The area is so rich in archaeological finds that experts believe it could take decades to fully survey and analyse the data from this site. The artefacts are now being analysed at the University of Nottingham. Dr Henderson said: 'For the first time archaeologists have recovered finds in context from the site of an ancient naval battle. 'We can now begin to say something about the fittings and equipment present on ancient warships and indeed what would have been taken into battle. 'It's exciting because we now have archaeological data to add to interpretations which were wholly based on iconographic representations and the ancient literary accounts.'","Remains of The Battle of the Egadi Islands found off the Sicilian coast.

29254,"These incredibly detailed images are so complex, you’d be forgiven for thinking they were close-up photographs of living cells or images created using algorithms on a computer. But, instead they’re meticulously handcrafted sculptures built using just strips of paper and a scalpel. The artwork, called Outbreak, was designed to show some of the smallest structures found inside the human body, including cells, microbes, pathogens and neurons. London-based paper artist used images and diagrams of microbes, bacteria and cells to create an exhibition called Outbreak. Each petri dish (pictured) contains a loose representation of bacteria. This bacteria is seen spreading across the petri dishes to represent how it 'metaphorically threatens' the development of healthcare . The installation was created by London graduate Rogan Brown. Although each of the images are based on the human biome, which includes microorganisms that live on humans, they are not designed to be scientifically accurate. The human microbiome, or microbiota, . is the collection of microorganisms that live on human skin, in the . saliva and mouth, in the eyes, and in the gut and the rest of the . gastrointestinal tract. It includes bacteria, archaea, fungi and single-celled eukaryotes, which are organisms whose cells contain a nucleus. The human body has about 100 trillion cells, and carries about ten times as many microorganisms in the intestines alone. Some of these organisms are useful for humans. However, most have no known effect. They are, instead, a combination of structures and images within these cells, across parts of the body. Outbreak was inspired by Brown’s participation in a seminar held at the Eden Project in Cornwall. ‘The Eden Project recently won a Wellcome Trust grant to create an exhibition space based on the Human Biome - the bacteria that scientists are only now beginning to understand,’ Brown told MailOnline. ‘The seminar was attended by a number of eminent bacteriologists and a handful of artists. ‘My contribution was really to create a stylised visual representation of this largely invisible microbiological world: I wanted to make something based on electronmicroscope photos of microbes, which gives people a glimpse of this strange, exotic world and that encourages them to see the beauty in it. The artwork (pictured) was designed to show some of the smallest structures found inside the human body, including cells, microbes, pathogens and neurons. Although each of the images are based on the human biome, which includes microorganisms that live on humans, they are not designed to be scientifically accurate . The left-hand image is a representation of a spore, found in bacteria, that is a resistant structure used to help the bacteria survive. The right-hand image is called Bacteria Deleria. It is designed to represent the bacteria that can lead to delirium and confusion, such as those found in brain infections . This sculpture, called Clone, is designed to represent a group of identical cells that share a 'common ancestry.' All the granulosa cells in a Graafian follicle, in the ovaries for example, are clones . ‘This is part of an attempt to change perceptions about microbes from negative to positive as the vast majority of the bacteria in our bodies play a very positive and important role in helping us to break down food, extract vitamins as well as fighting illness and so.’ Brown’s latest project work took four months to complete, and many of the pieces were limited. This is because visual representations of bacteria are often decontextualised electronmicroscope photos, or simplified diagrammatic representations. ‘The lack of visual material is in part due to the infinitesimally small size of bacteria and also to the fact that scientists have little interest in visual representations. 'They ""see"" microbes through complex experiments using very complex laboratory equipment; aesthetics don't really interest them. Other art in Brown's collection show cross sections of fruit kernels. Kernels are typically the softer, usually edible part, contained in the shell of a nut or the stone of a fruit. This paper sculpture reveals the complex structure inside a kernel, such as those found in cherries . The left-hand image shows the cross-section of a pod, similar to a cocoa pod. The seeds of the pod are shown around the centre, protected by the outer shell. Meanwhile, the right-hand image shows the cross section of the seed, that sits inside the pod . ‘So the images you see in Outbreak are imagined representations based on looking through thousands of pictures and diagrams of microbes at different scales and in different states.’ Brown continued that it is the repeated patterns and motifs and fractals of the structures that inspired him. ‘Science is at a very early stage in its understanding of bacteria in the human body; for the moment the scientists are merely identifying the varieties of microbes that inhabit us; the scale of the biome is so vast that it will take many years to do just this, to label and name the different types of microbe. This image represents the growth of bacteria. Brown told MailOnline that it is the repeated patterns and motifs and fractals of the structures that inspired him. He said: 'The aim is to convey the limitations of science when confronted by the immense power, complexity and, above all, scale of nature' Brown's work, including this image of small kernel, is inspired in part by the tradition of scientific drawing and model making, and particularly the work of artist-scientists such as Ernst Haeckel . ‘I make reference to this in the installation by the use of the Petri dish-style domes each containing a different microbial form, but the process is overrun by the sheer excess of bacteria that metaphorically threatens the whole project. ‘The aim is to convey the limitations of science when confronted by the immense power, complexity and, above all, scale of nature.' Other artwork in Brown’s portfolio shows the cross section of fruit kernels and cocoa pods. They are designed to show the complex nature of these organisms and, again, are visual representations rather than scientifically accurate portrayal. ‘I am inspired in part by the tradition of scientific drawing and model making, and particularly the work of artist-scientists such as Ernst Haeckel,’ continued Brown. ‘But although my approach involves careful observation and detailed ‘scientific’ preparatory drawings these are always superseded by the work of the imagination; everything has to be refracted through the prism of the imagination, estranged and in some way transformed.’","The installation was created by London-based artist Rogan Brown.

88990,"By . Deborah Arthurs . Coffees made with camel milk have gone on sale at a UK coffee shop for the first time today. Leading coffee house Taylor Street Baristas is selling the camel milk coffees at its store in Bank, central London and they will also be served at its Brighton store on Saturday. Customers were asked to make a suggested donation of £1 above the standard price of the coffee and all the money raised will go towards the agricultural development charity Farm Africa. Camel milk, which has a 'clean and palatable' taste similar to semi-skimmed cow's milk, is rich in fatty acids and has around half the fat of cow's milk as well as up to three times the amount of vitamin C. It is also rich in unsaturated fatty acids. Camelattes, anyone? The Taylor Street Barista coffee shop chain is to start stocking camel milk drinks in support of developmental charity Farm Africa . The idea was dreamed up by Richard Ford, deputy fresh foods editor at trade magazine The Grocer who is raising funds for Farm Africa by running the Brighton Half Marathon on 16 February. Camel milk It is used in coffees sold throughout the UAE and has been imported into the EU by Emirates Industry for Camel Milk & Products since July last year under the brand name Camelicious. A number of stalls at farmers markets have sold coffees using camel milk, but this is thought to be the first time a major supplier has sold camel milk drinks. UK first? Farmers markets have been known to sell camel milk drinks, but it is thought to be the first time  mainstream coffee shop has supplied coffees using camel milk . Pioneers: The coffee shop is the first chain in the UK to start selling camel milk, which is a popular choice in the Middle East and parts of Africa . Richard Ford said: 'When I first approached Camelicious about my fundraising project for Farm Africa, ordering a 'camelatte' in my favourite coffee shop seemed like a dream. 'Cow, goat and even buffalo milk are all widely available in the UK now and there is no reason why camel milk cannot make it into the mainstream here too.' EICMP deputy general manager and business development manager Mutasher Al Badry said his organisation hoped to build a strong camel milk industry in the UAE and encourage other camel farming areas to do the same. 'Camel milk has always been known in the Middle East, as well as Eastern Africa, but the accessibility for the wider public has always been limited.' Healthy: Camel milk is a nutritious alternative to cow's milk . Camel milk, which is said to be closer to human milk than any other milk, has a number of health benefits for those who choose to drink it. It is rich is vitamins and minerals, especially vitamins B and C, and iron. The drink also has antibacterial and antiviral properties. Further, the milk is a rich source of insulin, making it a great treatment option for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes sufferers. According to the Camel Milk Association, a month-long study showed that people with Type 1 diabetes who drank almost a pint daily improved their blood glucose levels.Camel milk is also a good source of protein, and can often even be drunk by people with lactose intolerance.Currently, it may not be the most popular milk in the world, but it does offer benefits that cow and goat milks do not - including lower cholesterol levels.Traditionally popular in the Middle East, the milk has become popular in the Netherlands and Belgium in recent years where it is generally sold in organic shops.",Taylor Street Baristas is selling camel milk coffees at its Bank store in central London.

47896,"Margaret Delfino donated her 200th pint of blood last week, bringing her total to to more than 25 gallons. Maragaret Delfino has been donating blood since 1954. She has donated more than 25 gallons of blood. Delfino, a 90-year-old great-grandmother in Bakersfield, California, began giving blood in 1954. She donated regularly until 2001, when she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. After five years of treatment, her doctors declared her cancer-free and she then continued donating. Now she brings several family members with her when she donates at the Houchin Blood Bank in Bakersfield, hoping they'll donate, too. Delfino says only a small percentage of people in her area donate blood. ""To think in Kern County that there are only 3 percent who give blood when there are so many who are able to donate,"" she said. Delfino wants to get the message out for more people to donate. ""It can mean the difference between life and death for some people,"" she said. She said she believes that donating blood is one reason she may have survived her cancer. ""Because I donated all that blood, and the doctors were changing my blood, is why I came through the cancer the way I did,"" she said. Delfino has plenty of family support, too, and she would like to see her family members follow in her footsteps. ""She's just an inspiration to all of us,"" said Jennifer Parks, Delfino's granddaughter. ""She's been a huge part of my children's lives, who are now 9, 8 and 5.

22601,"At least 41 people were killed and dozens wounded in a blast Monday at a security forces checkpoint in northwest Pakistan, authorities said. A girl places flowers at a shrine to army soldiers killed by militants who stormed Pakistan's army HQ. About 45 people were injured in the explosion in the Shangla district in the volatile Swat Valley, said Syed Altaf Hussein, a senior government official in the area. The explosion targeted a military vehicle, officials said. The blast is the latest in a string of attacks in the country. On Saturday, militants attacked the army headquarters in Rawalpindi, killing 11 military personnel and three civilians, according to the Pakistani military's press office. Nine militants died in the attack. A total of 39 hostages were freed Sunday morning after being held by five militants at the army headquarters. In a news conference Monday, the top spokesman for the Pakistani military said Saturday's attack was planned by the Taliban based in South Waziristan. Gen. Athar Abbas said intelligence agents intercepted a phone call in which Pakistani Taliban commander Wali-ur Rehman was informed about the start of the attack. Rehman responded by calling for a prayer for the operation to succeed, Abbas said. Abbas said the leader of the operation, who was captured alive, is from Pakistan's Punjab province. Four other militants were from Punjab as well. Five others were from South Waziristan. During the standoff, two of the militants held 22 hostages in a small room, Abbas said. One of the militants wore a suicide vest connected to a mine and a bomb. He sat in the middle of the 22 hostages. Abbas said this room was the focus of the operation and security forces were successful in storming the room and killing the militant with the suicide vest before he could detonate his bombs. Military officials said they have tightened security around army headquarters. The attacks will not deter Pakistan from launching an offensive in South Waziristan, the Interior Ministry said. South Waziristan is one of seven districts in Pakistan's tribal region along the Afghan border. Intelligence analysts consider it a haven for Islamic militants who have launched attacks in Pakistan and targeted U.S. forces in neighboring Afghanistan. A date for the offensive in the area has not been announced. The Shangla district east of Mingora is one of the areas where the military conducted search-and-destroy operations earlier this year. Troops targeted terrorist hideouts and reported the arrest of one militant leader and the death of another. Mingora is the largest city in the Swat Valley, where the Pakistani military is battling Taliban militants for control.

""After eight wonderful years at the BBC, it is time for my next big challenge,"" he said.
""In the last few weeks I've been approached about a number of exciting opportunities and I want to consider these in an open and transparent way.""
Cohen joined the BBC from Channel 4 in 2007 and went on to become BBC One controller in 2010. He was promoted to the director of television post three years later.
His job involved dealing with a series of high-profile disputes and criticisms.
He took the phone call following Jeremy Clarkson's assault on a Top Gear producer, which led the presenter to leave the corporation.
He also apologised to Sir Tom Jones after the singer complained of ""sub-standard behaviour from the executives"" when he was sacked as a judge on The Voice.
And he faced strong criticism this summer after asking celebrities to sign a letter supporting the BBC as it negotiated with the government over the future of the licence fee.
In a statement, Cohen said: ""BBC Television is on brilliant creative form. I feel very privileged to have led Television for the world's finest public service broadcaster and to have worked with so many smart and talented people.
""I'm very proud of the wide-ranging success of BBC Television under my leadership. There has never been a more exciting time for television and digital media.
""I'm looking forward to taking up a new leadership role in this age of intense creative and technological innovation.""
Cohen will leave at the end of November. His new job has not been announced.
In August, he admitted that the BBC could not compete with the finances of Netflix, which meant the streaming service turned down the corporation's offer to co-produce new royal drama The Crown.
The Guardian has reported he is ""considering offers from both UK and US companies"".
BBC director general Tony Hall described Cohen as ""one of TV's great talents"" who had done ""an extraordinary job"" in his time at the BBC.

A thug killed a member of the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing production team with a single punch before boasting: 'I've just smashed someone up,’ a court heard today. Ben Worden attacked lighting expert Paul Gunner, who had been celebrating his 32nd birthday, outside a kebab shop after 'taking exception' when Mr Gunner knocked on the window, a jury was told. In an act of 'thuggish behaviour that had the most tragic consequences,' Mr Gunner died after cracking his head on the pavement when Worden delivered the fatal blow, the court heard. Lighting expert Paul Gunner had been celebrating his 32nd birthday when he was attacked outside a kebab shop in Bexley, south east London . The jury was told Worden, 33, and two pals then ran off leaving his victim for dead, and bragged to some girls: 'I've just beaten someone up. Look at my knuckles!' Mr Gunner, who also worked on BBC2 pop music quiz show Never Mind The Buzzcocks, never regained consciousness after the incident in Bexley, south east London, and was pronounced dead an hour later. Worden handed himself into a police station the next day, but claimed it was a friend who attacked Mr Gunner. Timothy Cray, prosecuting, told Inner London Crown Court: 'We suggest all the evidence will show that this defendant murdered a man he didn’t even know during an unnecessary attack. 'This wasn’t a fight, it was a beating, putting a man down who was effectively defenceless. 'Although he may regret it now, in the seconds that mattered, this defendant, in drink and anger, intended to hurt Paul Gunner and hurt him badly, and that is exactly what he did.' CCTV pictures in the Bexley Charcoal Grill kebab shop shop shortly before Paul Gunner was attacked . Mr Cray added: 'Shortly before 1am in the early hours of Sunday October 16, 2011, this defendant, Ben Worden, was coming to the end of a long night's drinking in Bexley Village. 'He was at the local kebab shop when, for the first and only time in his life, he came across Paul Gunner, a 32-year-old man who had also been out in Bexley. 'Saturday October 15 was Mr Gunner’s birthday and he had spent the evening with his brother Michael and a group of his friends celebrating. 'Up to that point there is no suggestion that Mr Gunner or anyone else in his group had caused any trouble or done anything to draw attention to themselves. The parents of Paul Gunner, Peter and Andrea, at Inner London Crown Court as they attended the trial of Ben Worden . 'Paul Gunner had already got his takeaway. He began to knock on the window of the restaurant to tell his brother where he was or to hurry up. The defendant decided to take exception to Mr Gunner and spoke to him about banging on the window. 'A brief argument then developed between them which almost unbelievably led to the defendant attacking and killing Paul Gunner, who was a complete stranger to him.' The prosecutor said witnesses saw Worden land 'heavy blows' on Mr Gunner at least twice outside Bexley Charcoal Grill kebab shop. He continued: 'The first punch knocked Mr Gunner to the ground. The defendant then walked away across the road and at that moment in time, he had more than taken care of himself. In fact he was telling Mr Gunner to sit down meaning, ""stay down"". 'Unfortunately Mr Gunner, who was now dazed, got himself up and started to follow the defendant. 'Rather than just ignore Mr Gunner or walk away and leave the scene, this defendant decided to hit him again. 'In the second part of the attack he delivered a punch that was hard enough to knock Mr Gunner out cold and cause terrible head injuries as he went back, his head cracking against the road surface. 'Despite emergency medical attention, Mr Gunner never came round and he was pronounced dead just over an hour later at 2.26am.' Mr Cray told the court Worden could have easily walked away rather than hitting Mr Gunner a second time. He said: 'Despite having laid out Mr Gunner, including seeing and hearing his head hit the pavement, he made no attempt to stay and help the injured man. Instead, he fled from the scene with two friends who he had been drinking with that evening. 'Far from showing concern or remorse, his attitude moments afterwards was to boast about what he had done. 'He was pleased with himself. Once he had got away from the immediate vicinity, he saw some girls and said something like, ""Alright girls, I've just smashed someone up- or beaten someone up- look at my knuckles"". 'He held up the hand he had used to kill Paul Gunner. 'In all, his actions amounted to thuggish behaviour, random street violence that had the most tragic consequences.' Worden, of Welling, south east London, denies murder. The trial continues.

75987,"But politics, here and across the world, is perhaps moving outside familiar currents, into choppy waters, leaving mainstream politicians unsure if they are waving or drowning at the voters.
Take my fellow passengers, as I stuck a microphone underneath their noses and asked political questions that no reasonable person would want to answer before breakfast.
But most wanted to have their say, and it wasn't always what I expected.
I was braced for some pithy comments about senior politicians, but hardly what came: one was described to me as a ""Marxist Zionist war criminal"", even though the individual concerned is none of these things.
These three men - who described themselves as ""nationalists"" - didn't like anyone else any better. Politicians were all the same, in it for themselves, and they wouldn't vote for any ever again. Well, maybe UKIP. But probably not.
Three other passengers declared that they had never voted and never would.
Four middle-aged women said they were Labour - ""father was always Labour, so am I"" - but quickly added that they are all the same: ""In it for themselves, and take a third of your money.""
A scientific, judiciously balanced opinion poll this was not. Still, my trip to Gravesend captured a certain mood.
There was a deep distrust of politicians, a distaste for them that bewilders those in Westminster.
It was as if the Age of Insecurity met the Death of Deference and they had a child, born swaddled in contempt - I christen it The Disconnect.
It is one of the underlying stories of our age, and I intend to bang on about it quite a bit, in these columns and on The World This Weekend.
In the UK, two events have forced politicians to look voters in the eye.
One was the Scottish referendum, a close shave with the end of a nation.
It also gave the Scottish National Party more prominence, more members and soon more power.
And in the south of England it is the rise of UKIP that has forced Team Westminster to examine what the future might hold.
It is a situation that has been reflected by events in the US. The Tea Party, which is not a party, but a hydra-headed movement of like-minded malcontents, loathes Obama, but doesn't have much time for many Republicans either.
Supporters have a hearty distaste for Washington's ways, for Washington professional politicians, and are careful to call themselves Conservatives rather than Republicans. They talk of ""taking our country back"".
Even as the Republicans were in the middle of winning a stunning victory in this week's mid-terms, one leading Tea Party activist, Erick Erickson, was writing: ""In 2014, the American public has shown that it hates Washington DC, and the Republican leaders in Washington are demonstrating why.""
He added: ""Many of those GOP (Grand Old Party = Republican) Senate candidates who squeaked into office are, in my view, political philanderers - by which I mean that while they pledge their troth to conservative principles, they still carry on outrageous affairs with Big Government.""
In Europe the far right are on the march. They have increased their vote, most recently in Sweden.
But it is France that worries many in the political centre, not only in Paris, but even more in Brussels and Berlin.
They see a real possibility of President Marine Le Pen in the Elysee Palace in 2017 - the National Front at the heart of Europe.
Neither the Tea Party nor UKIP share these parties' fascist roots and they both passionately reject any suggestion of racism.
So I am in no way suggesting all these movements are identical.
But there is little doubt their voters' discontents are similar: the sense of a world that is changing too fast, that is slipping though their grasp.
They would all find solace in the Tea Party cry ""take our country back"" without wanting to spell out from what or whom.
The seminal book on UKIP, Revolt on the Right, identifies many supporters as ""the left behind"": older, poorly educated, poorly paid.
Partly this is a reaction to the global financial crisis, and globalism itself.
There are winners as well as losers and even as the the banks and the rich bounce back, others see no sign of recovery.
While an elite feel as comfortable in Boston or Birmingham, Berlin or Beijing, those left behind on the runway may find solace in a closer, and older, identity.
Protectionism and closed borders seem attractive ways of shutting out the threatening world.
This is part of the tale, but not the whole story.
The leaders of UKIP and the Tea Party whom I know are hardly poor and unskilled. Many are well-heeled, and well-educated.
While there is no doubt the main beneficiaries of The Disconnect are on the right, some parties on the left are growing too.
The Greens say they now have 20,000 members, the SNP boast of their increase while the Left party in Germany is the fourth largest in parliament and new movements are doing well in Spain and Greece.
Still, many mainstream politicians don't get it.
Here's a test. How many times after the Rochester by-election will you hear the term ""protest vote""?
It is a term banned from my personal lexicon. Of course people do vote differently in by-elections from general elections, when, in effect, they are choosing a prime minister.
But the idea that a vote is a mere protest underscores a profound disrespect for voters by the media and the main parties.
They look on voters as if they were a petulant five-year-old, who marches out the door clutching a teddy bear and one T-shirt, declaring that she's leaving home.
Indulgently, the parental parties look on, knowing she will be back long before teatime - indeed before she gets to the end of the road.
Likewise the parties think ""their"" voters will have their little strop over a war or a failed economy and return to a proper way of doing things, voting for one main party or another - or daringly perhaps a third - come the general election.
It hasn't dawned on them that the conventional way of voting may be what you could call an ""under protest vote"" - the least worst choice of those who might form a government - that may not reflect what they really want or believe.
The economic crisis has left a sour taste towards the parties who take turns in taking power.
In France, a disliked centre-right government has been replaced by an even more unpopular socialist one.
In the US, Obama, elected on a wave of hope, was elected again in 2012 but given a kicking in 2010 and an even more profound beating this week.
In the UK, an unpopular Labour government has been replaced by a coalition that has failed to win hearts and minds.
In short, all over the world, people want to scrawl on their ballot paper ""none of the above"".
I wonder how much this is because politics is disconnected from the world of choice we live in.
I could pause in my writing and take two minutes to choose a bewildering array of electronics, or exotic fruit or styles of shirts at the click of a trackpad.
Or I could take a break and pop down the road and order a skinny flat white, an espresso or an americano, some with or without chocolate or froth.
But my political choice extends to going to a local school every five years and choosing an often ideologically incoherent bundle of policies and then sitting back and watching for another five years.
Some in the main parties are very worried by all this implies.
There will be a hunt for solutions before the election.
Because it is beginning to dawn that the little five-year-old who'll be back repentant in time for tea has grown up, moved out, bought her own flat and is looking for others to love.
""There'll always be a room for you here,"" the parties will insist.
The next few months will show if it is too late for that.","It's not often that I get a chance to write about politics, but it's the way it works."

The New Zealand man was mistreated by his step-father for as long as he could remember, while his mother remained powerless against the man who beat her behind closed doors. 'There were times when it was late at night and I'd be woken up because of screaming, I could hear him beating my mum in the lounge,' Ben told the New Zealand Herald. Ben Smith, from New Zealand, was bullied by his step-father and neglected by his mother, eventually leading him to self-harm . 'I just felt cowardice, there was nothing I could do about it.' Only a teenager at the time, Ben sought to find affection in other places and became dependant on relationships. It was when he was between relationships, halfway through year 10, that he turned to self-harm after seeing examples in blog posts. Clearly deep in depression, Ben secluded himself to his room and began to cut himself regularly with blades where he hoped no one would notice the scars. 'It was in a period between relationships. I wasn't getting any affection there, I wasn't getting any affection at home, and I felt like I had no feelings, so with self-harm I felt pain,' Ben told the New Zealand Herald. His life was turned around however after a confrontation with his mother. 'I was just sick of the way I was treated. I said like, 'Mum you have to either get rid of him or me.' And she said, 'He gets home in about two hours, you'd better be gone by then,' he said. Since that day, Ben has barely looked back. He moved in with his maternal grandmother after tracking her down and has since started an audio engineering course. Although he's had to temporarily leave the course behind and move on to full time work due to his grandfather being diagnosed with cancer, Ben leads a far happier life.","Ben Smith, from New Zealand, was bullied by his step-father and neglected by his mother.

33848,"For the second straight year, youth and adult membership in the Girl Scouts has dropped sharply, intensifying pressure on the 102-year-old youth organization to find ways of reversing the trend. According to figures provided to The Associated Press, the total of youth members and adult volunteers dropped by 6per cent over the past year — from 2,994,844 to 2,813,997. Over two years, total membership is down 11.6per cent, and it has fallen 27per cent from a peak of more than 3.8million in 2003. While the Girl Scouts of the USA have had an array of recent internal difficulties — including rifts over programming and serious fiscal problems — CEO Anna Maria Chavez attributed the membership drop primarily to broader societal factors that have affected many youth-serving organizations. Smart cookies: For the second straight year, youth and adult membership in the Girl Scouts has dropped . 'Parents and families are less financially stable, frequently working two jobs or more, leaving little time to volunteer or take their children to extracurricular activities,' she said. In hopes of stemming the decline, the Girl Scouts are revamping their online platforms with new toolkits. One is aimed at streamlining the process of joining the Girl Scouts; another seeks to help volunteer troop leaders plan an entire year of meetings and activities with a single online visit. 'These tools will dramatically decrease the amount of time a volunteer has to spend preparing so that they can spend it serving the girls,' Chavez said. A crucial challenge, she said, is supporting the current ranks of volunteers and recruiting more adults to join them. A breakdown of the 2014 figures shows 809,413 adult leaders and 2,004,584 youth members. In 2003, there were about 2.9million youth members and more than 900,000 adults. In some regions, a shortage of volunteers is forcing Girl Scout councils to turn away girls who want to join. Chavez said there are about 30,000 girls on waiting lists nationwide. 'The need for what Girl Scouts has to offer is not decreasing — more than ever girls need our time and our commitment,' she said. 'Our challenge is to meet them where they are with enough caring adults to serve them.' Last year, the Girl Scouts enlisted First Lady Michelle Obama to make a video pitch for more adult volunteers. This year, there's a national recruitment campaign on Facebook. Campaign: Last year, the Girl Scouts enlisted First Lady Michelle Obama (pictured planting seedlings at the White House with Girl Scouts in 2012) to make a video pitch for more adult volunteers . Just two years ago, the Girl Scouts celebrated their centennial with a host of upbeat activities, but it's been a rough stretch since then. There was disgruntlement in some regional councils related to a deficit-strapped pension plan, as well as revenue shortfalls that prompted the national headquarters to trim about one-fourth of its staff through buyouts and layoffs. Many alumnae — including some who were active as volunteers — complained publicly about the closure of some Girl Scout camps and what they perceived as a misguided shift away from camping and other traditional outdoor activities. Chavez defended the changes, which included new programs seeking to boost girls' competency with money matters and encouraging them to pursue careers in science and technology. The Girl Scouts also have defended their decision to enter a business partnership with Mattel, the manufacturer of Barbie dolls. There's now a Barbie patch that girls can wear on their uniforms and a Barbie Girl Scout doll. Two consumer advocacy groups — the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and the Center for a New American Dream — have urged an end to the partnership, saying Barbie is a flawed role model for little girls. If there's a broad theme to the Girl Scouts' current outreach efforts, it's to depict its programs as invaluable in helping girls grow up to be leaders, particularly girls disadvantaged by poverty and racial or ethnic disparities. The Girl Scouts Research Institute recently compiled a comprehensive study, 'The State of Girls,' that assesses how the organization can help address social, economic, and health issues affecting the 26 million girls ages 5 to 17 in the U.S. That mission — as well as the membership problems and the new outreach strategies — will be discussed next week at the organization's national convention in Salt Lake City. Some other youth organizations also have been losing members, for reasons including competition from youth sports leagues and a perception by some families that they are old-fashioned. The Boy Scouts of America lost 6 percent of its membership last year; its youth membership has dropped from 3.3 million to about 2.5 million since 2002. The Boy Scouts alienated some conservatives last year by deciding to accept openly gay boys for the first time, while angering gay-rights supporters by maintaining a ban on gays serving as adult leaders . By contrast, the Girl Scouts have long had inclusive membership policies, although there have been some defections by families who felt the organization had become too liberal. American Heritage Girls, formed in 1995 as a Christian-oriented alternative, now claims more than 35,000 members.","The total of youth members and adult volunteers dropped by 6per cent over the past year.

16188,"Meanwhile, like-for-like food sales in the quarter were down by 0.9%.
In May the firm's new boss Steve Rowe unveiled plans to revive the retailer's clothing and homeware business, with lower clothing prices and better style.
The firm said consumer confidence weakened in the run up to the June 23 European Union referendum in the UK.
But it said it was too early to quantify the implications of Brexit.
In early morning trade, shares in M&S, which have fallen 29% over the last three months, were down by 1.2% to 290.6p.
M&S also said that this year its summer sale began on 5 July, two weeks later than in 2015, a move that would reduce total sales.
The firm said the impact of moving the summer sale and running fewer promotions than last year accounted for 5% of the like-for-like sales fall.
Analysis: Emma Simpson, BBC Business Correspondent
The latest headlines from Marks are bleak. In fact they're the worst like-for-like sales in clothing and homewares for a decade.  But the underlying picture is less grim, if you strip out the effects of price cuts and promotions and the clearance sale now falling into the second quarter of the year.
The wider clothing market is also having a pretty torrid time. New figures from Kantar Worldpanel showed fashion sales fell in the year to 5 June, compared with the previous year.
This is the first annual sales decline in six years. The wet weather in June hasn't helped. As if he didn't have enough to contend with, Steve Rowe now has to deal with the impact of Brexit - although he and lots of other retailers are still trying to gauge what the effects will be.
He says he's going to hold his nerve for the long term success of the business. Those nerves are likely to be tested in the months ahead.
""We continued to reduce the number of promotional events during the quarter, including just one 'cyber day' compared with six last year,"" the firm said, adding that it had repriced some 1,000 clothing lines since January.
Those 1,000 clothing lines have seen price cuts of around 17% since January, with some seven million items affected.
Chief executive Steve Rowe said the food business ""continues to strongly outperform a deflationary market"", with the 0.9% fall in like-for-like sales reflecting the timing of Easter.
He said the firm was ""confident that our strategic priorities and the actions we are taking remain the right ones to deliver results for our customers and our business"".
Mr Rowe also said that consumer confidence started to weaken in November, which continued through May and in the run-up to the EU referendum:
""We are operating in uncertain times and consumer confidence remains fragile,"" he added.
Today's first-quarter figures from M&S are worse than analysts' forecast a 5% to 8% drop for clothing sales.
M&S said its full-year guidance remains unchanged: ""We continue to manage the business for the challenging market environment.""
Richard Lim, chief executive of research consultancy Retail Economics, said: ""M&S's clothing figures are painfully weak, and fail to stem the loss of market share to other, more-agile, multichannel competitors.
""Its tireless efforts to revive the struggling clothing business have failed to resonate with its core customer base.""","M&S has reported a 0.9% fall in sales of clothing and homewares in the first quarter of the year, compared with the previous year."
78069,"Lawyer Aamer Anwar confirmed files will be handed to the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC).
The SCCRC will decide whether there are grounds to refer the case to the appeal court.
Megrahi was convicted in 2001 of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 which killed 270 people.
He is the only person to have been found guilty of Britain's worst act of terrorism.
The Libyan's widow Aisha and his son Ali met recently with Mr Anwar.
It is believed they will present concerns over the evidence which convicted Megrahi, including that given by Maltese shopkeeper Tony Gauci, who died last year.
He was jailed for 27 years but died of prostate cancer aged 60 in 2012 after being released on compassionate grounds in 2009.
Megrahi lost an appeal against his conviction in 2002, with the SCCRC recommending in 2007 that he should be granted a second appeal.
He dropped the second attempt to overturn his conviction in 2009, ahead of his return to Libya. He continued to protest his innocence until his death.
The Pan Am flight exploded at 31,000ft over Lockerbie, in the south of Scotland, on 21 December 1988.
As well as 259 people on board the aircraft, 11 residents of Lockerbie died on the ground as a result of a giant fireball caused when a wing holding thousands of gallons of fuel exploded on impact.
Relatives of some of the victims - led by Dr Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died on Pan-Am Flight 103 - have already attempted to appeal against the conviction of Megrahi.
The families had argued they should have the right to carry forward the miscarriage of justice appeal for Megrahi.
However, three judges at the appeal court in Edinburgh ruled in July 2015 that this would not be possible under Scots law.
The families' action was not supported by the Victims Of Pan AM Flight 103 group in the United States, which said there was ""nothing new"" in the appeal.",The family of Libyan bomber Abdel Fattah Megrahi are to file a formal appeal against his conviction for the 1988 Lockerbie bombing.

Clarke replied: ""What I would like to see is a path to make sure that not only are we gender diverse but ethnically diverse. What I don't want this to be is empty words.

""The $200,000 covers the bonuses and allowances as promised and the $190,000 is for the bronze medal,"" Takasu told BBC Sport.
""I had travelled from Tokyo prepared to reward them anyway, and to watch them win the bronze inside the stadium was very fulfilling,"" he added.
Before arriving in Rio, Nigeria's 'Dream Team VI' were held up in Atlanta, USA, because of a problem with the payment for their flight, and they only landed in Brazil just hours before their opening 5-4 win over Japan.
Nigeria also had a troubled build-up to their quarter-final against Denmark after the players boycotted a training session in a dispute over pay.
""This team showed resilience and fought the hardest to achieve success, despite all their problems - some people would have given up but they didn't,"" said Takasu.
""In everything we must always let people understand that they are appreciated and not just in football but generally in life.""
Coach Siasia, who becomes the most decorated African football coach at the Olympics having won a silver medal in Beijing in 2008, thanked Takasu for his generosity and support.
""We can't thank doctor Takasu enough because what he has done is amazing and unbelievable, we didn't see this coming when we set out for the Olympics"" Siasia told BBC Sport.
""It's not just about the money. You can't equate his gesture in figures or words, to find a big supporter far away in Japan travel down here to cheer and back us is unbelievable.
""I can only say a big thank you on behalf of my team and country, we pray God continue to bless him abundantly,"" Siasia added.
Nigeria, the 1996 Olympic football champions, are now the most successful African country in Olympic men's football, and the first African country to complete an Olympic medal sweep having won a sliver medal in Beijing in 2008.
Takasu's swift financial reward is in sharp contrast to the unfulfilled promises back home.
Some members of Nigeria's Super Eagles - led by Stephen Keshi, who passed away in June - are still waiting for the houses they were promised by the government for winning the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations in Tunisia.
Keshi is the fifth member of the so-called 'Golden Generation' of Nigerian footballers from 1994 to pass away, after Uche Okafor, Thompson Oliha, Rashidi Yekini and Wilfred Agbonavbare.
Africa's wealthiest businessman, Aliko Dangote, has failed to fulfil his promise to reward Nigeria's team with $1m for winning the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations.
Nigerian economist and banker Tony Elumelu's promise of $500,000 for the Super Eagles' Nations Cup success in South Africa remains outstanding.
The country's squad members who won the first Fifa Under-16 World championship in 1985 were only rewarded after a 30-year wait.
However, the rewards came too late for Kingsley Aikhionbare, who died in London in 1996. At the presentation to the players, a minute's silence was held in his honour.",Nigeria's men's football team have been rewarded with a hefty sum in Rio after a successful World Cup campaign.

According to The National Enquirer the larger-than-life character, who shot to fame on TLC'S Toddlers & Tiaras and currently stars in the spin-off series Here Come Honey Boo Boo, has had four daughters by four different men - one of which she cannot identity. The three men the 33-year-old grandmother can name have all served time in prison for crimes including sexual exploitation, arson and burglary. Finding fame: She now stars in the spin-off show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo along with her family . Honey Boo Boo, whose real name is Alana Thompson, was fathered by David Michael 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, 40, who currently lives with the family at their home McIntyre, Georgia. In 1998, he was sen­tenced to five years in the nearby Montgomery Prison for robbing a series of campsites and setting fire to at least one camper. Meanwhile her eldest sister, 17-year-old Anna 'Chickadee' Shannon - who gave birth recently - didn't know her father, David Dunn, 34, until he was released from prison work detail. When she was four he was sent to  court for a child support hearing and in 1995 he returned to prison when he was sentenced for stealing a handgun and again in 1998 for stealing cartons of cigarettes.

He told  The National Enquirer: 'Anna looks just like me. They want­ed me to sign away my rights to . Anna, but I refused. 'I don’t know who my own daddy is, and I always want . Anna to know who her father is. But June won’t let me see her.' The father of Honey Boo Boo’s 15-year-old sister Jessica 'Chubbs' Shannon, is Michael Anthony Ford, 35, who dated her mother just a few months before she became pregnant. In 2005 he served more than two years in prison for the sexual exploitation of a child over the Internet putting him on the sex offender registry. He was also charged with passing bad checks and for shoplifting at a Walmart where he worked. According to Ford he has paid around $300 a month in child support for years but is still denied access to he daughter and has only met with her five times. The father of Honey Boo Boo’s 12-year-old sister Laury is said to be unkown and a source told The National Enquirer: 'There are all kinds of family stories about who Lau­ryn’s dad is. I don’t think June even knows who it is. 'We’re convinced June never got married . to any of her kids’ fathers because she gets child support and welfare . payments for each of those kids.' Despite her unorthodox life­style, June’s father, Marvin Shannon, says he’s proud of his daughter and tunes into the show every week. Honey Boo Boo’s mom June, 33, has also had run-ins with the law. Court records show she served time for cashing bad checks in 1998 and for stealing $3,300 from a safe in a McDon­ald’s she was managing in McDonough, Ga., in 2004, although those charges were later dismissed.

A mugshot of her surfaced this month as well as details of her arrest which took place in Henry . County, Georgia. According to Starcasm, . there are also additional court reports which show that the . mother-of-three was the defendant in two child support cases around the . same time, which may explain the theft charges, though it is not . entirely clear. It . came just days after learning that child services made an unannounced . visit to her and husband Mike Thompson's family home in rural McIntrye, Georgia in March of this year. The coupon queen, as she is . commonly referred to, was arrested in a location that is more than . halfway to Atlanta when measured from her current home, suggesting that . she may have been trying to escape police. The family were visited by the Georgia Division of Family and Children Services in March, according to The National Enquirer. A . source told the magazine that authorities who made the visit 'found . reason to bring the case to court' but a 'court-appointed attorney' for . June convinced the judge to 'throw it [the case] out'. The source said investigators were called to the home as a result of June and Mr Thompson's unorthodox, and highly-publicised, parenting methods which include feeding Alana caffeinated drinks as well as roadkill for dinner. The family now star in their . own spin-off reality series, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, which has also . showed Alana go mud belly flop diving, adopt a pet pig named Glitzy, . attend local food auctions with June and help her buy more than a dozen . packets of chocolate milk powder, during one supermarket visit, using . discount coupons. The source added: 'Honey Boo Boo's upbringing raised eyebrows with neighbours.' The . initial visit by authorities is said to have occurred 'shortly after . filming began' on the new TLC series which premiered on August 8. It . attracted 2.2million viewers.

'Go Go Juice' incident, which saw Alana being fed the liquid after . having downed 15 bags of Pixy Stix, tubes of powdered sugar commonly . referred to as 'pageant crack', attracted negative criticism of its own. June was filmed instructing Alana to take 'two big gulps' from an . unlabelled bottle. Within seconds, the change was apparent and the . pageant hopeful was seen rapidly swinging her arms over her head and . spinning around on the floor, exclaiming: 'My Go Go juice is kicking in . right now!'

Rental mental: Increasing numbers of young people in Britain are choosing not to buy their own properties . An Englishman's house may be his castle - but buying his own could be becoming as much a thing of the past as knights in shining armour. New figures reveal nearly half of young Brits are . no longer interested in owning their homes - bucking a trend that is more akin to French and German renting culture. Today's figures come alongside news that house prices in parts of central London have rocketed by 116 per cent in the past eight years - with Mayfair homes outstripping this at a staggering 139 per cent increase in value. This outpaces the retail price index by . 86 per cent, while the average UK house price has dropped by 19.3 per cent in real terms over the same period. And while an overwhelming 93 per cent of Brits aged between 55 and 75 said they still saw owning their own property as the 'ultimate goal', just a third of under-35s felt the same way. Just over half of Brits aged 35 and under live in a home they do not own, according to the survey by financial protection specialist LV=.. And found 42 per cent . of them are simply not bothered about owning their own home - . even though many said they could afford to. This changing outlook mirrors the culture in Germany and France, where long term renting is the norm. Germany has the greatest proportion of renters in Europe as 61 per cent choose to rent, rather than own their home. It . is seen as a perfectly acceptable alternative brought about largely by . the reluctance of banks to loan money for mortgages - and it’s clear the . UK is now following suit. Only . half of the French live in their own properties - with 52 per cent . renting - due to a boom in property prices in recent years. With British banks also tightening lending criteria, the notion of long term renting is gathering momentum here as well. And while . the previous generation expected to own their first home by the age of . 25, those aged 20 to 35 said they can't see themselves putting down a deposit until . they’re at least 36. Attitudes have changed too, with almost three quarters said the notion that it’s shameful . to never own a property is ‘completely out of date’. More than three quarters of tenants said . the Government's 'Help To Buy' scheme has not motivated them to put a . foot onto the property ladder. And . given the latest figures from London, it's easy to see why even . successful young city workers may be less enthusiastic about finding . their own place. James . Williams is a 32-year-old IT worker from Winchester, Hampshire. He has been renting for . nine years and has no intention of buying his own property. He said: 'I’m happy to continue renting at the moment. It’s such a big commitment to buy my own house. 'It’s so hard to get a mortgage from the bank these days and it’s just easier at the moment to keep renting.' More than three quarters of tenants said . the Government's 'Help To Buy' scheme has not motivated them to put a . foot onto the property ladder. And . given the latest figures from London, it's easy to see why even . successful young city workers may be less enthusiastic about finding . their own place. Prime . Central London - where prices have more than doubled since 2005 - is made up the affluent areas of Mayfair, Knightsbridge, . Belgravia, Chelsea, Marylebone, Notting Hill, Kensington, South . Kensington. After Mayfair, the top performing area was Knightsbridge, where values are up 133 per . cent compared with eight years ago. It was only in . Kensington and South Kensington that prices didn’t more than double over . the eight-year period - although they still increased by 97 and 88 per . cent respectively. And last week, figures from the Halifax's monthly house price index showed a 5.4 per cent increase in the average value of a home, from £160,292 to £170,231 compared with the same period last year. Figures from LSL Property Services released at the same time showed there had been a 45 per cent increase in the number of first-time buyers in July compared with the same month in 2012. But today's figures show the number of renters has also risen - from 2.4 million in 2005 to 3.8 million in 2011-12. This 58 per cent increase comes despite the rising cost of rent. London living: Park House in South Kensington, . which was recently declared the most expensive house in the capital at . £105 million - 640 times the average house price . The average renter in Kensington and Chelsea is looking at a monthly cost of over £4,000 for a two-bedroom property - although in Bexley in South East London, renters can expect to pay an average of around £830 a month. This was in comparison with the whole of the South East, where the cost of renting - £1,152 per month - consumes almost half of the average person's monthly salary, and £947 per month - 39 per cent of monthly income - in the rest of the country. In the survey of 4,710 Brits, most of those who did not want to buy a house (17 per cent) named not . wanting to be tied down as their main reason for renting instead. After this came being unsure about the area (13 per . cent) and having no desire to buy (10 per cent) are their main reasons. Meanwhile, 7 per cent would rather spend their money on other things than putting it into property. The . majority of 20 to 35 year old tenants - 72 per cent - said they were either married . or in a relationship and earning an average of £34,084 a year. Lucian . Cook, director of research at Savills, described the . increase in prime central London against the rest of the country as 'unprecedented'. London                                                     7.2% . North East                                                5.9% . North West                                               4.5% .

""I have received a formal transfer request from Leon,"" said Coventry development director Steve Waggott.
""There had been indications over the weekend that this would happen but I was only formally notified on Monday morning after he arrived at the training ground.
""It's deeply disappointing when a player expresses a desire to leave the club in this way, especially when he has become such a firm favourite with supporters because of performances over the past 12 months.""
Clarke, who is League One's top scorer this season with 15, with a further three in cup competitions, has maintained the run of goals that began when he arrived from Charlton on a two-and-a half-year contract last January.
""With a year and a half left on his contract, we are in a position where we will only let him leave if the deal is right for Coventry City,"" added Waggott.

32954,"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . James Wignall, 16, was left 'staggered' after police called at his home to speak with him about his skipping 'frightening' his neighbour's horses . A teenage boxing champion has been visited by police following claims he was scaring horses by skipping in the street. James Wignall said he was left 'staggered' after officers accused him of frightening his neighbour's horses as he trained in the country lane outside his home in Croston, near Chorley, Lancashire. The 16-year-old, who has won 14 of his 17 fights so far including a North West title, said: 'I thought it was a joke at first. Two officers came out - just for that.' The visit came on a Saturday evening - the busiest night of the week for Lancashire's police force. And it came just months after the constabulary confessed they were they were no longer attending certain categories of crime including 'routine' burglaries. Personal visits have now been replaced with telephone calls. James, who is back in full training after taking time out of the ring for his GCSEs, regularly spends up to 45 minutes exercising with the rope outside his front door. His mother Carol said: 'It is crazy. Surely the police have much better things to be doing on a Saturday night than chasing up a complaint like this. 'I couldn't believe it when I opened the door and they were standing there. It is not as if he is breaking the law.' James, whose last fight was a victory over Tyson Fury's cousin Walter, took to the street with his skipping rope because his garden is not big enough. He said: 'You need a hard surface - grass is no good. But I've been in the road skipping for years. It is not as if I just started. 'The horses were in a field opposite, behind a huge hedge. I wasn't aware I was spooking them. There are tractors thundering down this lane and they don't seem scared of those. 'I'm not making a lot of noise and, as far as I'm aware, it's not against the law because this is a public highway. The teenage boxing champion, who has won 14 of his 17 fights, said police were concerned that his skipping in the country lane by his house in Croston, near Chorley, Lancashire could scare horses in a nearby field . 'And it is not like I'm just messing about. I'm serious about my sport. I'm back in the ring in September and my ambition is to turn professional one day. 'First I'm hoping to box for England and then Great Britain.' Mrs Wignall added: 'James has been boxing since he was eight. He's been skipping in the street for all that time too. Then, completely out of the blue, we get a visit from two officers saying he's been upsetting the horses across the road. 'I just find it bizarre. He's a good boy and he is dedicated to his sport. It's not as if he's hanging around street corners at night.' A Lancashire Police spokesman said: 'Two officers made a reassurance visit to the address. They spoke to both parties involved and no further police action was deemed necessary.'","James Wignall, 16, was left 'staggered' after police visited his home to speak with him.

Rays of hope were emerging today as the forecast suggested that the worst of the winter weather may finally be over. Winter Storm Vulcan hit hard on Wednesday across the Midwest and Northeast but by Thursday afternoon snowfall had tapered off. Snow stopped falling in upstate New York and southern New England this morning while Vermont would see its last flurries late in the afternoon. Scroll down for video . The snow was already melting today in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. A winter storm system delivered frigid temperatures to much of western Pennsylvania, but far less snow than was forecast . That's more like it! The start of spring appeared to be back on track as temperatures climbed across the U.S. on Friday . In Maine, snow would continue into Thursday evening. Snowfall today should be less than an inch in Upstate New York and southern New England, according to the Weather Channel. Vermont received between one and three inches - dramatically lower than the two feet earlier predicted by forecasters. The Northeast would remain blustery and cold but the snow flurries were diminishing by the hour. Temperatures would stay around 10F in upstate New York and New England with temperatures up to 30F predicted in Pennsylvania and New Jersey south to the Virginias.

Don Margoni, from St. Joseph, Michigan, hikes along a snow-covered trail at Riverview Park, in St. Joseph today. The temperatures looked set to increase over the weekend . Much of the Midwest was dry on Thursday with isolated rain or snow showers in northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and northwest Michigan. To the relief of those in the region, who have battled one of the hardest winters on record, no significant snow accumulations are expected. Temperatures peaked in the 30s across the Great Lakes and upper half of the Ohio Valley.  Milder 40Fs and 50Fs were expected from Minnesota southeast to Kentucky. The weather forecast was dramatically . different from the heavy snow that pummeled the Midwest and Northeast . just 20 hours earlier.

A trooper responding to an accident was pinned between vehicles, said the Ohio State Highway Patrol, which confirmed the deaths. One vehicle lane opened about four hours after the first accident. The initial crash involving 16 . vehicles left two people dead: Grzegorz Piwowarczyk, 42, a truck driver . from Palatine, Illinois; and Hannah Matheny, 20, a passenger in a car . from Parma, Ohio, the Ohio State Highway Patrol said on Thursday.

Gloucester City Council unveiled the company in 2011 as a developer and says it is ""working with Stanhope"" to find a solution.
The company has not commented on the development.
Stanhope signed a contract with the council in 2012 and has until March 2016 to put in a planning application.
That application had been expected in March.
City council leader Paul James said both parties have ""obligations"" and they are ""trying to find the best and the quickest way to deliver a scheme"".
Mr James confirmed that the redevelopment of the city's bus station will go ahead as planned.
I've been told that Stanhope PLC is seriously considering the viability of the King Square development.

59123,"An Argentine prosecutor said Friday there is enough evidence to continue an investigation into whether President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner hid Iran's alleged role in a deadly 1994 bombing, a probe that paused after a different prosecutor died mysteriously last month. Federal Prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita filed a 61-page report essentially endorsing what prosecutor Alberto Nisman claimed before he died in January: that evidence shows Fernandez and other top officials tried to cover up Iran's alleged involvement in the bombing that killed 85 people at a Jewish center in Buenos Aires. Pollicita sent his report to a judge, who is expected to examine it next week after he returns from vacation. The judge can determine whether the case can proceed to trial. Nisman, a special prosecutor investigating the 1994 bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association, alleged last month that Iran was behind the attack, and that Fernandez, to help sweeten a trade deal, covered up Tehran's involvement. That trade deal, Nisman alleged, involved cash-strapped Argentina receiving Iranian oil in exchange for meat and grain. Nisman made the allegation in a nearly 300-page report. But on January 18, one day before he was to testify before lawmakers about his allegations, he was found dead in his apartment with a gunshot wound to the head. Nisman filled with fear before his death, friend says . In his trash can, investigators say, was a 6-month-old draft warrant for Fernandez's arrest. Fernandez initially called it a suicide, but a test found no gunpowder residue on Nisman's hands. Fernandez said a few days later that she didn't believe Nisman killed himself, alleging that some members of the country's intelligence agency fed Nisman false information about a cover-up and were responsible for his death. The President and the other accused government officials deny any cover-up in the bombing. Anibal Fernandez, the President's general secretary, said the allegations against Fernandez are ""a clear maneuver to destabilize democracy"" in the South American country. He also said the investigation lacks ""judicial value"" or ""importance."" About 10 years ago, Nisman was appointed as special prosecutor to investigate the bombing by then-President Nestor Kirchner, Fernandez's late husband. Conspiracy theories aplenty in wake of prosecutor's death . CNN's Rafael Romo, Elwyn Lopez and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.",Federal Prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita files 61-page report.

73646,"By . Sophie Jane Evans for MailOnline . Texas's top criminal court has thrown out a law banning 'upskirt' pictures - because it restricts photographers' right to freedom of expression. The Court of Criminal Appeal struck down part of the anti-'creepshot' statute, which criminalised the taking of surreptitious images in public for the purposes of sexual gratification. These included revealing photos of women - often called 'upskirting' or 'downblousing' - that were taken without their consent. Rejecting the law on Wednesday, Judge Sharon Keller claimed it was a violation of federal free-speech rights and a 'paternalistic' intrusion of a person's right to be aroused. Rejected: Texas's highest criminal court has thrown out a law banning 'upskirt' pictures - because it restricts photographers' right to free speech and is a 'paternalistic' intrusion of a person's right to be aroused . She said that photos - like paintings, films and books - are 'inherently expressive' and therefore protected by the First Amendment, according to the Houston Chronicle. 'The camera is essentially the photographer's pen and paintbrush,' wrote Judge Keller in her opinion. 'A person's purposeful creation of photographs and visual recordings is entitled to the same First Amendment protection as the photographs and visual recordings themselves.' Under the 8-1 ruling, which supported a previous decision made at the 4th Court of Appeals in San Antonia, Texans could take surreptitious images for arousal or sexual gratification. Peter Linzer, who teaches constitutional and First Amendment law at the University of Houston, told the newspaper: 'It's hard to see how you could make taking a picture a crime.' Case: The Texas Court of Criminal Appeal (pictured) struck down part of the anti-'creepshot' statute, which criminalised the taking of surreptitious images in public for the purposes of sexual gratification . The appeal, which questioned why some free speech can be treated as unlawful behavior while others are not, stemmed from a case involving a man charged with improper photography in 2011. Ronald Thompson, in his early fifties, was charged with 26 counts of improper photography after taking underwater pictures of children, aged 3-11, dressed in swimsuits at a San Antonio water park. Prosecutors claimed that the constitutional right to free speech, including taking public photographs, should not be a cover behind which lawbreakers can hide. But Thompson's attorneys claimed the statute did not distinguish 'upskirt' photography from 'merely photographing a girl in a skirt walking down the street', meaning it could criminalise paparazzi journalists, arts patrons, pep rally attendees and 'even the harmless eccentric'. Surreptitious: Rejecting the statute, Judge Sharon Keller said that photos - like paintings, films and books - are 'inherently experessive' and therefore protected by the First Amendment . Judge Keller appeared to agree, saying: 'Protecting someone who appears in public from being the object of sexual thoughts seems to be the sort of ""paternalistic interest in regulating the defendant's mind"" that the First Amendment was designed to guard against.' But she added: 'We also keep in mind the Supreme Court’s admonition that the forms of speech that are exempt from 1st Amendment protection are limited, and we should not be quick to recognize new categories of unprotected expression.' She also admitted that 'upskirt'-type images are intolerable invasions of a person's privacy. During the past 13 years, at least 151 inappropriate photography cases have been filed in Harris County. One saw a 12-year-old girl sentenced to a year's probation for surreptitiously taking a photograph of a classmate in a school dressing-room, even though the image did not show nudity and was deleted minutes later.","Court of Criminal Appeal struck down part of anti-'creepshot' statute.

The supermodel and her celebrity friends took the £150-a-night Craigellachie Hotel at the weekend - a rural Speyside getaway - as they celebrated nutritionist Rose Ferguson’s 40th birthday with a Burns-themed bash. They were joined by the likes of Noel Gallagher, Nick Grimshaw and Sadie Frost for a wild weekend of partying on the banks of the River Spey – an area once known as a favourite destination of Queen Victoria. Scroll down for video . Supermodel Kate Moss and her husband Jamie Hince leaving the Craigellachie Hotel on Sunday night . Kate Moss brought a dose of rock ‘n roll glamour to the Craigellachie Hotel - a rural retreat in Speyside dubbed ‘the Cotswolds of Scotland’ The 120-year-old country hotel has recently been re-opened after a £3m refurbishment. It features a renowned whiskey bar called The Quaich, which has one of Scotland’s biggest selections of single malt whiskys, and which stocks almost 1,000 bottles. The group also partied at the hotel’s newly-installed Copper Dog pub – where they tucked into a supper of haggis, neeps and tatties. The party was a traditionally Scottish affair, with a piper playing happy birthday on the bagpipes. The area is perhaps an unlikely destination for the supermodel. It is better known as an ‘angler’s paradise’, and the River Spey is famous for salmon, sea trout and brown trout fishing.

He came across the hotel by chance after travelling to the area with his father who had been evacuated to the area during WW2. He said: ‘When I first stayed at The Craigellachie I instantly fell in love with the place. However I was saddened that it had become run down and lost some of its spark. ‘For the next year or so I kept my eye on the sale of the hotel hoping that someone would buy and restore it, and then I made the snap decision to buy it myself.

Speyside features the largest concentration of Scotch whisky distilleries in the country including Glenfiddich and Macallan . The hotel also features a billiards room and a basement cinema room which can be used for private screenings . ‘Most of my businesses are related to bars and restaurants in London and internationally so I really hadn’t considered a hotel in the Highlands of Scotland. ‘However, there is something special about The Craigellachie and Speyside. There is a real sense of community in the area and I really want The Craigellachie to continue to be part of that.’ Throughout the hotel each of the 28 bedrooms has been restored, maintaining original features such a fireplaces and antique furniture, the en-suites have also been refurbished in keeping with the traditional feel of the hotel.

97964,"By . Rebecca Evans for the Daily Mail . Rick Parfitt has told how he came an ‘inch away from dying’ of a heart attack that has convinced him to finally tame his hard-living ways. The Status Quo guitarist, 65, was still drinking a bottle of wine a day and smoking 30 cigarettes, despite a long line of serious health scares. But it was not until he suffered his second heart attack three weeks ago that the father of two young twins finally received the wake-up call he needed to give up alcohol and cigarettes. Scroll down for video . Rick Parfitt, with his wife Lyndsay and twins Tommy, left and Lily Rose, right, pictured at home in Spain . ‘I’ve made a pact with myself,’ he said. ‘That part of my life is over as I do not want to die, I want to live.’ Speaking for the first time about the ordeal, Parfitt described how he was lying alone in the cabin of his luxury tour bus near the Croatian city of Pula when he felt the first telltale pains in his chest. It had been less than eight hours since the multimillionaire had finished a sell-out gig in Austria and in that time he had drunk a bottle of wine and smoked ten cigarettes. ‘I was an inch away from dying,’ he said. ‘I remember the bus stopping at about 4.30am in the middle of nowhere and I started to feel very ill. ‘I felt a terrible pain, in my chest and down both arms and across my shoulders. I didn’t know if it was a heart attack or not but I suspected it was. It felt like an elephant starting to sit on your chest. ‘You don’t know whether you’re going to die or not. You lay there in incredible pain not knowing what to do with yourself. There’s no relief, you just hope you don’t die, because I was lying there dying I guess.’ Parfitt – who had a quadruple heart bypass in 1997, a throat cancer scare in 2005 and his first heart attack in 2011 – managed to wake up his personal assistant Paul Ashcroft, who called an ambulance. Before his last heart attack, the 65-year-old was still smoking 20 cigarettes a day and drinking a bottle of wine . The musician, who along with Francis Rossi helped found the hugely successful British rock band 47 years ago, was taken to a local hospital before being flown back to the UK in a private jet for emergency surgery. While on the operating table, he had another heart attack. It meant Status Quo, who have had a string of hits including Rockin’ All Over The World and opened the Live Aid concert in 1985, were forced to cancel a number of gigs across Europe. Parfitt, who lives in Marbella with his third wife Lyndsay, 54, and six-year-old twins Lily and Tommy, said: ‘I’ve had 50 years of smoking and drinking and abusing my body. ‘There comes a time when you have to look at yourself and think, “Right, that’s it, it’s now time for a change”. All my life I’ve defied the doctor’s orders, thinking that I’m made of steel. Rick Parfitt, pictured with his first wife Marietta, left and his second wife Patie, right, at Live Aid . ‘But as stupid as this may sound, I’m pleased I’ve had this heart attack because I couldn’t see a way out of my bad habits.’ Parfitt enjoyed a hedonistic lifestyle throughout most of his years as a rock star – at one point spending £1,000 a week on cocaine and drinking at least a bottle of vodka a day. He stopped taking drugs 11 years ago but continued to smoke and drink heavily, even after having a stent fitted three years ago. He was released from hospital four days after falling ill on August 2 and was due to perform a few days later. But at the insistence of his doctor, Parfitt pulled out of the gig. Speaking from a boutique hotel in Kingston, Surrey, he said: ‘It was the first time ever that I’ve missed a gig and it was a very odd feeling because even though I wasn’t there, I lived the gig in my mind.’ Parfitt, right, with his third wife Lyndsay, said he has not touched a drop of alcohol in three weeks . Parfitt has now abstained from alcohol or cigarettes for three weeks – the longest time since the age of 15 – and he says he has never felt better. ‘There are so many advantages I never realised to being sober,’ he added. ‘When I wake up in the morning I want to get up and get the day going and I can’t tell you how much better I feel. ‘My wife has been begging me to sort myself out, telling me “You’re going to die if you don’t stop”. I realise now for the first time in my life that if I carry on I will die. I don’t regret the things I’ve done but I look back and it’s incredibly frightening the way I’ve lived my life. ‘In the light of sobriety now, sitting at home in Spain with my feet up out on the terrace on lovely warm evenings, thinking, “God, you just didn’t realise”.’ ‘I’ve always loved the fun side of life and had a good sense of humour and the fact you don’t drink doesn’t separate you from your natural sense of humour.’ The musician, who is performing tonight with Status Quo in Norfolk, added: ‘I’m going to enjoy my life so much more now. I’m ready to rock, I can’t wait.’ Status Quo tour the UK in December. Tickets are on sale from LiveNation.","Rick Parfitt, 65, was drinking a bottle of wine a day and smoking 30 cigarettes.

A total of 1,967 bodies were exhumed from 200 graves from the 1800s
The Bishop of Blackburn Rt Rev Julian Henderson led a service at 12:00 BST at the memorial gardens reburial site in Wainwright Way.
He acknowledged the support given to the project ""particularly in the light of the sensitivities involved"".
""I am grateful for the care taken by contractors and archaeologists in overseeing the work to ensure this will continue to be a site of remembrance for future generations,"" he said.
The land where the bodies were found was formerly the burial ground at the old St Peter's Church which opened in 1821 in Blackburn.
The large number of children discovered was put down to a lack of good sanitation and medicines leading to a high mortality rate.
Experts believe one of the men buried at the site was a soldier injured in the Crimean War.
St Peter's Church, which would have seated 1,500 parishioners, became dilapidated in the mid-20th Century and was demolished to ground level in 1976.",A reburial service has been held at a graveyard in Blackburn where hundreds of bodies were found.

32665,"While President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping enjoy the Californian sunshine this week, a different kind of heat threatens Xi in his troublesome backyard, Tibet. Nearly 120 Tibetans have doused themselves in gasoline and set themselves alight in protest against Chinese occupation and repression. Most have died. Theirs is not the only form of protest. In November, students gathered in their hundreds in Chabcha (known in Chinese as Gonghe) county, Qinghai province, to protest the use of Mandarin, rather than Tibetan, as the language of education. In April, unemployed Tibetan graduates in Machu county, Gansu province, protested that Chinese immigrants were taking jobs, while last month, thousands of Tibetans converged on a pilgrimage site on Naghla Dzambha mountain to prevent a Chinese company mining it. The default Chinese response to protest is to use force. In its official human rights report this year, the U.S. State Department described repression in Tibet as ""severe,"" noting abuses such as ""extrajudicial killings, torture [and] arbitrary arrests."" In March, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee described Tibet as among the world's ""most repressed and closed societies."" The cycle of repression and protest goes on. Just last week Tenzin Shirab, a 31-year-old nomad, died after setting himself on fire. In 2011, the self-immolation of another young man, Mohamed Bouazizi in Tunisia, was said to be the catalyst for the Arab Spring, an outpouring of long-repressed desire for freedom that was hailed by world leaders. But you will search in vain for any stirring words on Tibetan freedom from President Obama or other world leaders. Western politicians perform a careful dance in relation to Tibet. Those who elect them want them to speak out for freedom and human rights; China, reported to hold more than one-fifth of the United States' total foreign-held debt, wants them to shut up. Realpolitik dictates appeasement: electoral politics requires tough talk. The result is a mess. There have been countless official ""expressions of concern"" about the situation since the self-immolations started to spread two years ago, and we are constantly reassured that private channels are being used to apply pressure to China. Officials and junior ministers are permitted to issue calls for restraint. But there is a ceiling above which such statements do not go: leaders remain mute. President Obama has not publicly addressed the issue of human rights in Tibet since taking office. Secretary of State John Kerry has made one careful comment since his appointment, but there is no evidence he raised Tibet during his visit to China in April. China recently threatened commercial consequences for the UK unless Prime Minister David Cameron apologized for meeting the Dalai Lama in private last year.

The authors of the WEC report said a vacuum in energy policy since the election was deterring investors needed to create new electricity supplies.
But the government said it was still a world leader in energy policy.
It said it was committed to securing energy supplies through nuclear and shale gas.
The criticism from the WEC follows a complaint from the UN's chief environment scientist that the UK was turning away from renewables, just as they were being embraced by the rest of the world in the run-up to Paris climate talks this month.
The WEC report ranks countries on their policies to keep the lights on, bills and carbon emissions down. It says the UK has been a leader in these policies.
But its says the government's drastic withdrawal of subsidies for wind and solar power has deterred investors needed for new energy supplies.
Electricity has become comparatively more expensive, and the UK remains on a ""watch-list"" over how it will secure its future energy supply.
The report warned the UK faced the run-down of nuclear plants and the closure of coal-powered stations, alongside ageing infrastructure - meaning its ranking is set to fall in future assessments.
It urged the government to ensure consistent policy to secure and maintain investments while reforms to the energy system are being implemented.
Britain still gets an AAB rating from the council and is still in the world's top four. But that may be a let-off, because the report was written before damaging revelations in a leaked letter that the government has misled people over its progress on EU renewable energy targets.
The government denies misleading Parliament to believe that it will hit its mandatory 15% renewable energy target in 2020.
But the letter makes clear that the shortfall of approaching 25% in renewables has been hidden from the public - and over several summer months in which subsidies were being cut, journalists were consistently told that the EU renewables targets were still being met.
Energy Secretary Amber Rudd told MPs the government remained committed to the targets, which will be achieved by greater focus on renewable heat and transport, rather than electricity.
She added: ""I recognise, as that letter does, that we don't have the right policies, particularly in transport and heat in order to make those 2020 targets, but we have four to five years and I remain committed to making those targets.""
A spokesman for her department, commenting on the WEC report, said: ""We've made record investments in renewables and are committed to lower-carbon secure energy, such as nuclear and shale gas, which will help keep the lights on for future generations.""
Energy analysts are baffled as to why the government is blocking onshore wind and large-scale solar power, as these are among the cheapest options for hitting the renewables target.
The UN praises the UK for its international role on climate, especially in helping developing countries get clean energy supplies like wind and solar.
But the head of the climate negotiations said she noted concern among international allies over recent UK policy changes.

The secret ballot took place at Lampeter, Ceredigion.
Those who voted in favour fell short of the two-thirds needed for change.
Sixty one of 120 members present voted for such ceremonies to be allowed, while 50 voted for no change and nine to allow blessings.
The Archbishop of Wales, Dr Barry Morgan, said: ""It would be a very brave or perhaps a very foolish Bench of Bishops who were to bring the bill before the governing body at this stage.
""Because that might just rip the church apart and lead to the acrimony that has been absent from this debate.""
The governing body is made up of the Bench of Bishops - the six diocesan bishops - plus 51 clergy and 86 non-clerical representatives.
A majority vote of 66% within each of these groups is required to change church law, but this was not achieved.
The vote could still trigger a long process towards making changes, although any alteration to the constitution would require a new bill to be passed.
The Archbishop said earlier that it would be for the Bench of Bishops to decide how to take the issue forward after the result of Thursday's vote.
However, he said any alteration would require ""quite a long convoluted complicated process"".",The Archbishop of Wales has urged the Bench of Bishops not to bring a bill to the governing body to allow blessing ceremonies.

A man said to have been released from a secure mental hospital against his wishes was yesterday being questioned over the murders of his mother and sister. John Jenkin, 23, had been sectioned after an apparent suicide attempt in the week before the double murder. According to a relative, he had a history of mental health problems and had pleaded in vain to be kept locked up because he feared harming himself or someone else. Katie Jenkin, left, and her mother were found dead at family home in Millom. John Jenkin, right, who was arrested on suspicion of murder, was released from a secure mental hospital against his wishes . Police were called to the family’s . terraced house in Millom, Cumbria, at 8.40am on Saturday and found the . bodies of Alice McMeekin, 58, and her university student daughter Katie . Jenkin, 20. The family’s new pet collie, Fenn, was . also killed. Jenkin, who was described as a Goth, was arrested nearby . on suspicion of murder. He was said to have doted on his mother and younger sister, but the heavy metal fan was also obsessed with the occult. Cumbria police have not revealed how the women died, although no gun was used in the murders. Friends and neighbours were shocked by . the murders of the  animal-loving divorced mother-of- two and her . daughter, who was  studying in South Wales and was on  a weekend visit . home. Yesterday a neighbour recalled seeing . the suspect in the street at 3am on Saturday and also hearing screams . coming from the pebble-dashed house. ‘I was coming back home at 3am with my . girlfriend and I was walking up the back street and he was walking . around and I looked at his face and it was like looking into space, . there was nothing there,’ he said. ‘Then I went home and I heard a lot . of screams. It sounded like the screams of a dog. I went into my . backyard and I heard these piercing screams I will never forget.’ He did not contact the police, but . more noise was heard at around 8am. ‘It sounded like someone telling a . dog to shut up,’ said the neighbour. Police discovered the bodies at the family home and have not revealed how the two women died . Police were called and found the . bodies. Jenkin, who is unemployed, spent much of his time on his . computer and listening to music. According to a relative, he had . suffered mental health problems for some time. ‘He’s had a very dark past, but I don’t want people to think he is some kind of monster, I just feel sorry for him,’ she said. The relative said he was sectioned . under the Mental Health Act for attempting to slit his wrists and then . allowed home again in the days before the tragedy. She said he had told . health workers that he feared he would harm himself or someone else if . he did not stay in a secure psychiatric unit. ‘John begged people for . help, but he didn’t get it,’ she said. Friends said John Jenkin was close to . his family. One friend, who asked not to be named, said: ‘He idolised . his mum and his sister. His little sister was his world, and his mum was . too.

25483,"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . PUBLISHED: . 08:48 EST, 30 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:49 EST, 30 October 2013 . Trenches 23,000 feet deep, psychedelic spirals of lava and the highest known mountain in the solar system - these are just some of the highlights see by the Mars Express spacecraft over the past decade. Mars Express, launched in 2003, has now orbited the planet nearly 12,500 times, providing scientists with unprecedented images and data collected by its range of scientific instruments. The data have been used to create an almost global digital topographic model of Mars' surface, providing a unique flyby video. Scroll down for video... Mars Express (pictured) was launched in 2003 and has now orbited the planet nearly 12,500 times . The images in this video were taken by the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HSRC) and were put together by the DLR German Aerospace Center as part of the ten years of Mars Express celebrations. ‘For the first time, we can see Mars spatially – in three dimensions,’ said Ralf Jaumann, project manager for the mission at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). Mars Express reached its destination on 25 December 2003 – and caused an initial shock. The HRSC took its first close look down towards Mars and sent back an almost plain white image. This was the first of many images of a crater taken from the spacecraft's camera at an altitude of 277 km . As well as images from the Mars' Express, Nasa's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity has been capturing images from the ground. The above southward uphill view was taken when the rover began to ascend the northwestern slope of 'Solander Point' on the western rim of Mars' Endeavour Crater. The view combines five frames taken by Opportunity's navigation camera on the 3,463rd Martian day, or sol, of the rover's work on Mars. Opportunity had begun climbing the hill on Sol 3451 and completed three additional uphill drives before reaching this point. The rover team is using the rover to investigate outcrops on the slope. The northward-facing slope will tilt the rover's solar panels toward the sun in the southern-hemisphere winter sky, providing an important energy advantage for continuing mobile operations through the upcoming winter. ‘Everyone just swallowed,’ recalled Mr Jaumann. Scientists were worried that the camera had failed. But one of the nine different channels of the camera – the infrared channel – was still showing weak contours of the surface of Mars. The solution to the problem was quickly found; the sensitivity of the camera close to Mars was much greater than that expected by the researchers, meaning that the first image was overexposed. Two Mars orbits later, on 10 January 2004, and with the correct exposure time, the first of many successful images was acquired from an altitude of 277 kilometres. Since then an almost complete 3D global view of the Red Planet has been created from the numerous images. The scientists put the camera images together piece by piece like a jigsaw puzzle, creating a global map of Mars. Of the 145 million square kilometres of the surface of Mars, 97 million have already been covered at very high resolution, where one pixel corresponds to less than 20 metres on the surface. Almost the entire surface of Mars has now been imaged at a resolution of better than 100 metres. The 3D view of the valleys, canyons and lava flows is possible because of the unusual imaging principle used by the camera. Valles Marineris pictured here is a system of canyons that runs along the Martian surface east of the Tharsis region. At more than 4,000 km long and 200 km wide, the Valles Marineris rift system is one of the larger canyons of the solar system . Nine light-sensitive detectors sweep the surface in sequence from nine different observation angles. This data is then processed into three-dimensional images by the DLR planetary researchers. ‘We can see the entire topography almost as well as if we were standing on Mars ourselves,’ said Mrs Jaumann. Although the conditions on Mars are no longer suitable for the existence of liquid water, at some time in its past water must have flowed over its surface, scouring out deep valleys in the highlands and creating huge outflow valleys three to four billion years ago. Using the camera's super resolution channel, images can be acquired that are so rich in detail that geological processes in which water was involved can be seen. It is likely that there were periods of flowing and standing water during the history of this planet, which is so dry and dusty today. Of the 145 million square kilometres of the surface of Mars, 97 million have already been covered at very high resolution, where one pixel corresponds to less than 20 metres on the surface . This means that different climatic conditions must have been predominant in the planet’s early history. This is also clearly visible in the three-dimensional camera images showing structures near the equator that have been caused by glaciation. ‘The Mars Express mission was due to end after one Mars year – or about two Earth years,’ said Mr Jaumann. But during the past 10 years the European Space Agency (ESA) has kept extending the mission. The spacecraft is now due to continue orbiting Mars until the end of 2014. Mr Jaumann added: ‘That is actually the bottom line on the past 10 years; everything is still functioning perfectly and we are still acquiring new data that is important for Mars research.’","Mars Express was launched in 2003 and has now orbited the planet nearly 12,500 times.

72298,"The 28-year-old woman called Farkhunda was beaten to death after being accused of burning a copy of the Koran, although witnesses say she did not.
It took just four days for the verdicts to be reached. Eight men were sentenced to 16 years in prison and 18 others found not guilty.
The incident led to widespread protests against the treatment of women.
A decision in the case of 19 policemen accused of failing in their duty to prevent the attack is expected on Sunday.
Farkhunda's brother told the BBC that the family were not satisfied with the verdict and that all of the main defendants should be put to death.
Farkhunda had argued with an amulet seller about his practice of peddling charms to women at the well-known Shah-Du-Shamshaira shrine, which is within walking distance of the presidential palace and Kabul's main bazaar.
The amulet seller is one of those sentenced to death on Wednesday.
In the course of the argument Farkhunda was accused of burning the Koran and a crowd overheard and attacked her.
In confession statements read in court, some of the accused admitted they had been drawn in by the claims. An official investigator has said there is no evidence she burned the Koran.
There have been mixed reactions among the Afghan public following the court's decision.
Some have welcomed it and say Farkhunda's family have finally been given justice.
However, the Afghan judicial system is widely seen as corrupt and many others have criticised the court's proceedings.
Kangaroo courts are common across the country, especially in areas where the government does not have full control and where tribal elders and local strongmen act as a self-appointed judiciary.
Even in the cities where people can resort to the courts, cases can face long delays and corruption is chronic. The police force is more focused on fighting an insurgency than upholding the rule of law.
The trial today may provide some justice for Farkhunda but it does not reflect the reality of efforts to counter crime and violence across Afghanistan.
Violence against women, and violence in general, are common in a country that has been at war for over three decades.
But even against that backdrop, the attack on Farkhunda on 19 March shocked many Afghans, taking place as it did in the heart of the capital and under the eyes of the police.
Farkhunda was beaten to death before her body was driven over by a car, dragged through the streets and then set on fire.
Some of the attackers recorded the brutal killing on their cell phones and footage was later uploaded to social media sites, including some that appeared to show a policeman taking part in the attack and pushing Farkhunda onto a roof.
Correspondents say that had it not been for the videos and the nature of the incident, it would have gone unnoticed like hundreds of similar cases, especially in rural areas, many of which never make it to court at all.
The case is not the first where the justice system has rapidly handed down death sentences for a high-profile crime - in October five men were hanged for a gang rape in Paghman district.
In that case, as in the current trial, there were concerns from rights activists over the speed and fairness of the convictions.",A court in Kabul has sentenced eight men to death for a brutal attack on a woman in March.

38415,"Health chiefs say a register would alert GPs to the specific needs of adults and children with autism and help tailor services for them.
The National Autistic Society said it would ""help improve the health and wellbeing of autistic people"".
But getting a quick diagnosis was still an issue, a child autism charity said.
Autism is a lifelong, developmental disability that affects how a person communicates with and relates to other people, and how they experience the world around them.
GPs in England already keep a register of patients with learning disabilities, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence thinks patients with autism should be easily identified by healthcare professionals too.
NICE says a register - which would be anonymous outside a patient's surgery - would help staff to adapt their approach to suit patients' needs.
For example, doctors might need to take time to explain information clearly, nurses could vaccinate children at quieter times of the day, and surgeries could turn down lights for those with sensory problems.
Robyn Steward, 30, has autism and lives in south London. She says going to the GP can be a difficult experience.
""I used to dread ringing up. I have lots of appointments and the receptionists are very understanding.
""But a lot of autistic people aren't verbal and don't find it easy.
""GPs assume a level of understanding but they need to give us more processing time and more time to go through issues.""
She says a flag on medical records telling GPs about an autism diagnosis could make things easier.
And finding out how many autistic people there are in each local area is ""really important"", Robyn says.
""Adults are often under-supported.
""If you know there are lots of women in one area then you can set up a woman's group.
""It's about looking at the needs of the community.""
Mark Lever, chief executive of the National Autistic Society, welcomed the autism register proposal but said it was not the only answer.
""It must be accompanied by continued efforts to improve GPs' understanding of autism so they can recognise the needs of different autistic people and provide the right care and guidance.""
Mandy Williams, from the charity Child Autism UK, said a register could also help track how many people have autism and ""enable better planning of services in the future"".
But she added: ""It doesn't address the more fundamental problem of actually getting a diagnosis in the first place.""
The guidance from NICE over an autism register will now need to be accepted by NHS England before it is put into practice in GP surgeries in England.","GP surgeries in England could be able to keep a register of patients with autism, NHS England has said."

81666,"A woman who was told she probably only had flu when she went to hospital suffering cold sweats and pains in her arm was diagnosed four days later with cancer - on the same day her late sister was also diagnosed with the disease. Tara Deacon is now trying to fulfill her bucket list after Hodgkin's lymphoma returned and doctors said there was nothing more they could do, seven months after younger sister Jade passed away after her own brave battle. Tara, 26, from the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, first started feeling unwell one night in 2010, when she began suffering sharp pains and bouts of cold sweats. She drove herself to the Nambour Hospital but decided to leave when she was forced to wait for hours and still had not seen a doctor. Tara Deacon (left) and sister Jade supported each other through chemotherapy, radiation treatment and their bone marrow transplants about four years ago . Lymphoma is the most common blood cancer and the third most common childhood cancer in the World. The causes of lymphoma are not yet known. Exposure to radiation and certain chemicals puts some people at higher risk. For people diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, prognosis is generally good, with a five year survival rate of more than 87% in Australia. People diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Australia have a five year survival rate of 71%. 'I thought I was having a heart attack from those sharp pains,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It took forever to see someone at the emergency room that night and my partner needed to go to work. 'I told the receptionist to not worry about it and I would just go home and sleep through it.' 'The lady told me that it could just be a cold or flu so I thought it wasn't anything serious and left.' Tara returned the next day, when she had a CT scan of her abdomen and a bone marrow biopsy. At the same time, she noticed her sister Jade, who was with her at hospital, had a 'massive lump on her neck' so she got checked too. Four days later, the sisters were both told they had Hodgkin's lymphoma by a specialist at the Royal Brisbane Hospital. Tara  remembers started noticing sharp pains down her right arm and chest after dinner in 2010 and rushed herself to hospital . Sadly, Jade (right) passed away in February at the age of 22, leaving her now five year old daughter Acaica (left) in the care of her dad and Tara . While there is no known genetic link with the disease, the sisters supported each other through chemotherapy and radiation treatment and their bone marrow transplants about four years ago. 'We supported each other through the tough battle - we just kept going,' Tara said. Despite her determination, Jade died in February at the age of 22 when her body failed to accept her donated bone marro. Her death left her then four year old daughter Acaica without a mother, and in the care of her dad and aunt Tara.

In Australia in 2011, there were 1371 deaths caused by non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 72 deaths caused by Hodgkin lymphoma. Lymphoma Australia chief executive Sharon Millman spoke to Daily Mail Australia, and said that lymphoma awareness in Australia needs to be on par with awareness of breast cancer and prostate cancer. 'Every two hours someone is diagnosed with lymphoma, and every five hours we lose someone to the disease,' 'At the moment a lot of people don't know anything about it, so we want to raise awareness so that when people are diagnosed they at least know what it is.' Ms. Millman noted that often people aren't even aware that lymphoma is anything to worry about, despite it being the fifth most common cancer in the world. 'We don't want people to be afraid of the unknown. We want them to have the facts and be equipped to deal with it.'

94675,"FIFA is facing the prospect of losing two of its biggest sponsors after airline Emirates decided not to renew its contract and electronics giant Sony also considering ending its links with the world governing body. The confirmation comes four months after a number of FIFA's official World Cup partners expressed concerns about the negative publicity surrounding the latest allegations of corruption. Emirates' contract expires next month and the Dubai-based airline has confirmed it will not renew its sponsorship. FIFA said it has known of the decision since 2012. FIFA president Sepp Blatter is facing the prospect of losing two of the organisation's biggest sponsors . It is understood Qatar Airways - owned by 2022 World Cup hosts Qatar - is considering becoming a sponsor in its place. FIFA confirmed that Emirates will not be renewing its deal and that talks are ongoing with Sony. Samsung, which is a major Olympic sponsor, may take over from Sony. Both Emirates and Sony are among FIFA's official partners - the six top tier sponsors who provided hundreds of millions of pounds in sponsorship income to the world governing body. FIFA said in a statement to the Press Association: 'Emirates had already informed FIFA back in June 2012 about the restructuring of its sponsorship concept and FIFA respects this. Due to the ongoing negotiations, we cannot give any further information about future partners in this category at this stage. 'The current contract with Sony still runs until 31 December 2014 and we are currently in on-going discussions with Sony.' Emirates also confirmed its plans, saying in a statement: 'Emirates can confirm that a decision has been made not to renew the sponsorship agreement with FIFA past 2014. This decision was made following an evaluation of FIFA's contract proposal which did not meet Emirates' expectations.' In June, a number of partners including Sony made public their concerns about the effect of continuing negative publicity around FIFA. It followed publication of fresh allegations of corruption surrounding World Cup voting and elections for FIFA positions. Conservative MP Damian Collins wants Chuck Blazer (above) investigated for alleged World Cup bidding fraud . Adidas, the sportswear firm which is perhaps FIFA's most important partner and has a deal until 2030, said at the time: 'The negative tenor of the public debate around FIFA at the moment is neither good for football nor for FIFA and its partners.' Japanese electronics giant Sony said in June the corruption claims should 'be investigated appropriately' and called for FIFA to observe 'its principles of integrity, ethics and fair play'. FIFA earned more than £230 million from sponsors and other marketing partners last year. Meanwhile, a Conservative MP has called for the Serious Fraud Office to investigate World Cup bidding after claims that the FBI persuaded a FIFA executive to bug his meetings during the London 2012 Olympics. Damian Collins says reports that Chuck Blazer agreed to take a tiny, secret microphone into meetings with other football officials should persuade the SFO to investigate. The New York Daily News reported that Blazer, the American former FIFA executive committee member, agreed to take a bug hidden inside a key ring into meetings, some of which took place in London. He was under investigation by the FBI and tax authorities for millions in unpaid taxes, the newspaper said. Those he invited to the meetings included Russia 2018 organising committee chief Alexei Sorokin and Frank Lowy, the head of the Australian 2022 bid, but it is not known whether they did actually meet Blazer. The SFO said last week it does not have the jurisdiction to investigate World Cup bidding but Collins believes the latest reports on the FBI should make it reconsider. Collins told Press Association Sport: 'If the FBI investigation includes meetings that Chuck Blazer held in London during the Olympics, then that should come under the jurisdiction of the SFO.' US attorney Michael Garcia has finished his investigation into bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, won by Russia and Qatar respectively. England also bid for the 2018 tournament but was eliminated in the first round of voting. Garcia's report is now being studied by the head of FIFA's ethics adjudicatory chamber, German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, but he has said he will not publish it in full. Collins wants the SFO to demand FIFA send it a copy of the Garcia report.",Emirates' contract expires next month and the Dubai-based airline has confirmed it will not renew its sponsorship.

57572,"The announcement was made in Egypt, which has been leading mediation efforts.
People in Israel and Gaza give their reaction to the news:
I'm now really satisfied that after eight days of bombing we have a ceasefire.  We were really scared about a possible ground invasion, especially after leaflets were dropped.
We've lost a lot of people this week. I know of a family about half a mile from my house that has been wiped out. I haven't been outside since the operation started but I will go out tomorrow and I expect I will see lots of damage.
People are celebrating in the streets, we've been in a war but we are now hopeful that the siege might be lifted.
I studied a Masters degree at Oxford and only returned to Gaza just two weeks before the bombing started. I'm unemployed at the moment but I hope to start looking for a job.
I hope the ceasefire will last, I believe both sides want peace.
I'm quite upset that we have a ceasefire. I believe Israel hasn't achieved anything. About an hour after it was declared I heard one of the Iron Dome rockets bringing down a missile.
Public opinion here is that we don't want a ceasefire. I believe we've lost in the eyes of the world - I think in a few months time we'll pay for this.
There is great sympathy for the Gaza citizens; they're as much victims of Hamas as we are.
I've amazed myself with how stoic I've been recently. Were it not for my partner I wouldn't have gone to the stairwell of my home as I feel that living on the north-east side of the building we occupy is a safe spot.
People are amazed when they see me out in the town shopping, but I've been very pragmatic about this whole situation. I'm not going to leave Ashkelon. I've been here for six months and my partner is Ashkelonian.
We realise that the average man in the street in Gaza is not the enemy, we should be working with them. What we need is peace.
I've just seen on the TV that the ceasefire has been announced. I am delighted. It is what we want.
I am the breadwinner looking after 11 family members including my wife, two children, parents and five sisters.
We have spent a whole week now in the house since the escalation of air strikes. It is very hard to go outside, it's just not safe. The bombs are targeting civilians and they fall from the air and also come from warships. We are watching the news all the time when we can and we haven't slept.
Every day, the electricity is turned off for eight hours. It's winter here so it is cold but inside the house we are OK. We have enough food and water but medicines are running out. My elderly father has a heart condition and I haven't been able to get any medicine for him. Everything is closed. I can't go to work and I can't go to the shops.
Lately I've seen lots of trucks evacuating people from north of Gaza. The refugees are staying in UN schools.
People don't want this situation to continue, we all want this ceasefire. There has to be an end to this cycle of violence.
I worry so much for my children. My son, who is five years old, has started to think that this way of life is normal. He was watching the TV looking at the children dying, my wife quickly jumped up and turned off the TV but he shouted: ""I want to see this."" Later he said that he didn't want to do his homework ""until the war ends"". I am so worried that he knows what war is like.
The ceasefire is good. I'm glad, I believe that many people had hoped for more to be achieved at the peace talks in Egypt but it's good to have some time out from the conflict.
I've lived through previous ceasefires and obviously they haven't worked to bring about long-term peace. Sadly, I don't think this ceasefire is any different. Hamas wants to eliminate Israel, so they won't give up.
I wish they would give up.
My friend in the south hasn't left his home in a week now. He says that riding the bus is too dangerous so everyone is staying indoors. Also, some universities have closed and a lot of the students have moved to the north where it is a bit safer.
I heard on the news about the bomb blast which hit a bus. But it was quite far from where I am. In Tel Aviv it has actually got a bit better because all the attacks are in the south. Generally, Tel Aviv has had fewer rockets so no alarms.
Life is a bit better but it is very depressing.",The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has been declared.
97915,"But the moment that shot him to global fame was not on the field - it was in the commentary box.
Gummi Ben - as he is known - roared out a sustained, high-pitched torrent of joy when his national side scored a last-minute goal against Austria.
The goal saw Iceland through to the last 16 of Euro 2016 and knocked the Austrians out.
And Gummi Ben's response was so loud, so boisterous, so exuberant, that his commentary has ricocheted around the world.
BBC Sport - Euro 2016
Gummi Ben, who became a commentator after hanging up his boots in 2009, has been fending calls off all day.
""It's been quite strange and actually hectic, because the phone hasn't stopped ringing,"" he told the BBC.
""But I'm really enjoying it! It's part of the job.""
Gummi Ben admits he doesn't have a clue what he said when Arnor Yngvi Traustason scored.
And even when his own commentary was played back to him on BBC radio, he still couldn't be quite sure.
But, thanks to Icelandic website The Reykjavik Grapevine, we have a translation. Here is part of it:
""It's three against two. Emmi (Theodor Elmar Bjarnason)! Go into the box! Go into the box! EMMI!""
""Ahhh… YES!…(Emmi passes to Arnor Ingvi Traustason)... Y-E-E-E-S! (ball hits back of the net) Yes, Yes, YES, YES, Y-E-E-E-S!
""We are winning this! We are through to the final 16! We are through to the final 16! We are beating Austria!
""The voice has gone! But that doesn´t matter! We have qualified!
""Arnor Yngvi Traustason scores! Iceland two, Austria one! What? The final whistle has been blown here, and never, ever have I felt so good!""
As a nation of 332,529 people (roughly the population of a small UK city), Iceland does not traditionally pack a massive punch on the stage of world football. In fact it has no professional clubs.
But internationally they are on the rise.
Here is how the 21st Century has stacked up for them so far.
To qualify for the Euros, they beat Turkey, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Kazakhstan and Latvia. But never have they qualified for an international tournament.
So you can see why Gummi Ben got so excited.
And his unbridled enthusiasm echoed across social media.

43672,"But it has been more than 40 years since the UK last got around the negotiating table and it could be a little rusty. Here are four key requirements to getting a good deal.
When it comes to trade deals, the devil is in the detail. Trade deals have grown incredibly complex - the recently concluded deal between the EU and Canada runs to almost 1,600 pages and covers everything from fisheries to  financial services.
Successful negotiations require a skilled - and large - team, but the UK has not negotiated a trade deal since 1973. The EU has 596 trade negotiators and the UK urgently needs a similarly sized team to craft new deals with major trade partners.
A first step will be to bring back the handful of experienced and expert UK nationals in the European Commission. They will know what to expect when facing European negotiators across the table.
Successful negotiation involves clearly identifying your own trade interests and not simply reacting to the other side's. The UK Government must know what it wants from any deal, what it wishes to keep off the negotiating table and the concessions it is willing to make.
This is not easy. A well-prepared government will have consulted extensively with businesses, small and large, as well as consumer groups and trade unions. UK-based banks need to be able to operate across the EU single market.
Communities in the North need manufacturing industries which serve that market, potentially creating thousands of jobs. But access probably comes at the price of accepting freedom of movement for EU citizens and paying contributions to the EU budget.
Getting a good deal requires strong leadership which galvanizes the whole of the government's machinery, across ministries and non-governmental stakeholders.
Positions taken in the trade negotiations should be backed up by communication between national leaders where necessary. Any sign of disunity is likely to be exploited by opponents in a negotiation.
As a rule of thumb, 80% of a trade negotiation is preparation, 20% execution. Important decisions are made before formal negotiations commence. The UK government should start to prepare immediately, capitalising on the time it has to form a stellar negotiating team, precisely define its national interests, and flesh out a strategy.
Going into the negotiations, the UK will need an astute strategy to get a good deal with the EU and with other trading partners. Intelligence on the other side's negotiating position and bottom lines will be crucial, as will an anticipation of how they will react at each turn.
The UK will need to have identified all potential sources of leverage, and potential allies within Europe and beyond.","The UK has a long history of negotiating trade deals with the European Union, and it's no surprise that it hasn't negotiated a deal since 1973."

80241,"Jason McGovern, 19, died after being attacked on a night out in Omagh, County Tyrone, on New Year's Eve, 2012.
No-one has been convicted of the killing, although several people have been sentenced over a fight involving Jason and his friends that night.
Jason's brother Niall said the family feel they will never get justice.
A County Tyrone man acquitted of the ""one-punch killing"" was on Friday given a four-month suspended sentence for affray on the night of Mr McGovern's death.
Mark Donnelly, 23, from Greencastle was acquitted of his manslaughter in June.
""It's just someone to take responsibility is what would mean a lot to us - I don't think we'll ever get that sense of justice,"" Mr McGovern said.
""I think that's what makes it even harder, not only losing Jason, but no-one's taken responsibility, and that's hard to deal with.""
He added: ""We thought we had a strong case at the start of proceedings and look how it went.
""Nobody's been held accountable.""
There were two incidents involving Jason and his friends on the night.
In the first, outside a bar, a friend of Jason's jaw was fractured in an attack. A number of people - including Mark Donnelly,  23, from Greencastle, who was cleared of Jason's manslaughter - were convicted for their roles in that attack.
Jason, who was studying performing arts at college, was injured after being punched in a second incident in the car park of a different pub.
He died at a friend's home hours after the incident.
Niall McGovern said the family's lives had been in limbo for the last four years.
""We're just glad we can put an end to that legal process and get on with our lives,"" he said.
""It's not the outcome that we would have liked, but we're just glad we can start moving on with our lives and start grieving.
""Every time something happened in the case, Jason's face was in the paper and it brings it all back home.""
Niall McGovern said his brother had done nothing to provoke either incident that night.
""Jason definitely wasn't a provoker of any situation,"" he said.
""Looking back it was just a pointless argument that he didn't play any part in - he was just the victim.
""Whenever we saw the CCTV footage and you could see Jason, that was his role, the peacekeeper, the friend, he was the person who looked after people on a night out.""
Jason was one of three brothers, from the village of Tydavnet, whose mother has MS.
Niall McGovern said his brother loved to help his mother and his death and been particularly difficult for her.
""He's a big loss in her life,"" he said.
""My mother's MS, she can't go through her own grieving process. She's very much immobile and she's doing everything in front of everyone, she can't close the door or go to a different room.""
Niall McGovern was at his girlfriend's house in Galway when he received the news that his brother was dead.
""I went into the house and the phone rang, it was Dad broke the news to me,"" he said.
""It's unexplainable just the feeling that comes over you, I've never felt anything like that before.""
""Even now, looking back, it's still hard to take in and hard to believe, the type of person Jason was, that something like that could happen to him.""
He said the only consolation he could take was that his brother had lived his life to the full.
""He was friends with everyone, there was no-one he wouldn't get on with, he'd chat with everyone, young and old,"" said Niall McGovern.
""I suppose that's the only positive thing that you can take out of it - even though his life was short he made the most of it, he lived it to the full.""",The family of a man who died after being punched in the head has said they will never get justice.

72103,"The Labour leadership challenger said his party should not give the Tories a ""blank cheque"" on negotiations.
But rival Jeremy Corbyn said Parliament had to ""work with"" the result of the referendum.
Ministers said they would deliver on the ""decisive"" referendum verdict.
The UK voted to leave the EU by 52% to 48% in a referendum on 23 June but the manner and timing of the country's departure remains uncertain.
The prime minister has said she will not begin the formal legal process of separation by activating Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty this year, insisting that a ""sensible and orderly departure"" from the EU will take time.
However, she has come under pressure from some senior Conservatives to begin the process in early 2017 amid press speculation about possible delays.
Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Smith said the British people were ""lied to"" by those campaigning to leave the EU and they deserve to have a say on the terms of the exit.
He told BBC Radio 5 live: ""It would be irresponsible of Theresa May to simply trigger Article 50 and sleepwalk out... Labour still believes that we should be a part of the European Union.""
Mr Smith says he will ""fight tooth and nail"" to keep the UK in the EU and said that under his leadership, Labour would oppose the triggering of Article 50 in a future Commons vote unless certain conditions were met.
He rejected accusations he was trying to override democracy, saying if Labour believed working people were worse off by the settlement he could ""legitimately put it back to the British people"".
""Theresa May says that 'Brexit means Brexit' - but nobody knows what Brexit looks like,"" Mr Smith said.
""It could involve trashing workers' rights and environmental protections, opening our NHS up to foreign competition, making it harder for us to trade with our neighbours and damaging our economy.""
He added: ""Under my leadership, Labour won't give the Tories a blank cheque.
""We will vote in Parliament to block any attempt to invoke Article 50 until Theresa May commits to a second referendum or a general election on whatever EU exit deal emerges at the end of the process.""
It is not yet known whether Mr Smith will have the chance to vote against Article 50.
A legal challenge is under way to try to ensure Parliament has a say before Article 50 is triggered, but the government says this can happen without the need for a Commons vote.
Mr Smith is pressing the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, whom he is seeking to topple, to match his commitment.
In the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Mr Corbyn called for Article 50 to be invoked immediately but he has since distanced himself from the comments, saying he misspoke and due time was needed for the UK to determine its negotiating strategy.
Article 50 gives the sides two years to negotiate the terms of the split, with any extension having to be agreed by all 28 EU members.
At a campaign event in London, Mr Corbyn said: ""People voted for a variety of reasons, but nevertheless they voted.""
He set out what would be his ""red lines"" for Brexit, including full access to the EU single market, retention of workers' rights and allowing EU nationals in the UK to remain.
Sam Tarry, Mr Corbyn's campaign director, told BBC News Mr Smith's Article 50 pledge would cost Labour ""an awful lot of seats"".
""If he wants to use parliament to block, you know, us going into Brexit, I think that would be deeply unpopular with millions and millions of working class, potentially Labour, voters all across the country,"" Mr Tarry said.
""I think we need to have a bit more of a considered position.""
Most Labour MPs supported a vote to stay in the EU - but the Labour Leave campaign said Mr Smith's pledge was ""electoral suicide"".
""It is time for the Labour Party to put behind itself the divisions of the past and accept the result of the vote,"" said John Mills, Labour Leave's chairman.
Sir Patrick McLoughlin, the chairman of the Conservative Party, said: ""The result of the referendum was clear and decisive and we in the Conservative Party will deliver on the people's verdict.
""Whether it's Jeremy Corbyn or Owen Smith, Labour are too divided and out of touch to make a success of Brexit.""
In his round of interviews, Mr Smith also faced questions about his use of the word ""lunatic"" at a campaign event.
""What you won't get from me is some lunatic at the top of the Labour Party,"" he told party members in Hammersmith.
Mr Corbyn's campaign urged him to apologise, saying his comment was offensive to people with mental illness.
Mr Smith told the Today programme he had not been referring to Mr Corbyn but had been referring to himself and apologised to anyone who was offended by the use of the word, saying his language would be ""less colourful in the future"".","Owen Smith has said he will ""fight tooth and nail"" to keep the UK in the European Union until Theresa May commits to a second referendum or general election."

3560,"By . Laura Collins In Denver . PUBLISHED: . 13:12 EST, 31 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:10 EST, 31 December 2013 . One of Denver’s most publicized celebrations of the legalization of the sale of recreational marijuana has been cancelled, just hours before the New Year brings an end to the state of Colorado's prohibition of the drug. The City of Denver took the extraordinary step of hand-delivering a letter threatening to rescind the liquor license of the downtown venue at which the party, dubbed Cannabition, was due to be staged. The letter also threatened legal action against all sponsors and participants in the all-day party, planned by cannabis tourism company 420tours. Cancelled: Party organizer Matt Brown had planned to hold a celebration of the new rules on marijuana . The move serves as a warning shot for any who view the New Year and the new law as heralding a free-for-all for public cannabis consumption. In a statement to MailOnline, 420tours founder and party organizer Matt Brown said: ‘It is unfortunate that the City of Denver has chosen to take such a hardline stance against the idea of adults assembling to legally celebrate the unprecedented milestone represented by Amendment 64.’ Cannabition had been intended as the major organized celebration of the historic legal change. Organizers had hoped to stage the party at the city’s NORAD Dance Club but at 4pm on Friday afternoon Denver Department of Excise and Licenses delivered a letter to club owners. The letter stated: ‘We … dissuade you from hosting the event; however, if you go forward, we will exercise any and all options available to the City of Denver to halt the event and hold the business owners responsible for violations of law. ‘We are also ready to hold individual attendees responsible for violations of City ordinances prohibiting public consumption of marijuana.’ On Monday afternoon, after much argument and negotiation, Mr Brown and the club owners admitted defeat. Barred: An all-day party, due to be held at Norad dance bar, has been shut down . New era: Colorado marijuana growing facilities and dispensaries have been preparing for the new rules, with the introduction of marijuana-infused drinks . Munchies: Edible marijuana products are also being introduced in the state . It is the clearest sign yet that the . City of Denver, under statewide and even worldwide scrutiny, is . determined that the licensed sale of marijuana on January 1 should not . be confused with a free-for-all in public consumption of the drug. But it is a bitter blow for Mr Brown, who said it is too late to find another venue for the highly publicized event. He said: 'It is disingenuous for the city to tell the world that Colorado is open for business when such major questions remain regarding what happens after ""seed to sale"" when the whole point of amendment 64 is to responsibly consume cannabis without fear or retaliation.' In reality, though the sale of cannabis in licensed premises is legal, public consumption is not and Mr Brown is one of many pushing for the nascent legislation to go further and permit public consumption, as well as sale, albeit under controlled circumstances. But, with Colorado under intense public scrutiny, it is perhaps unsurprising that those tasked with enforcing the new law on January 1 should be concerned with just that and remain intolerant of any attempts to stretch it beyond the liberties so newly granted. Know the law: Michael Elliott, Executive Director of the Medical Marijuana Industry Group, points at some of the laws that will accompany the legalization of recreational marijuana on January 1 . Amendment 64 is the first legislation to set up a framework to regulate and tax sales of recreational marijuana. It not only decriminalizes it but establishes a legal market for the drug, licensing cultivation, processing and retail. It is illegal to give or sell marijuana to a minor. You must be over 21 to purchase the drug. Those from instate can buy up to 1 oz in any form. Anyone form out of state can buy half that quantity and must consume it before crossing state lines. Retailers . must be licensed and currently all such licenses have been issued to . growers and retailers already providing medical marijuana which has been . legally available in Colorado for a decade. Recreational . marijuana will be taxed at 15 per cent excise and 10 per cent sales tax – . higher than that sold to holders of a medical certificate, or ‘red . card.’ It is illegal to . drive high. An initial legal limit of five nanograms of THC per ml of . blood was set but it has been suggested that this could be waived for . drivers testing above this cutoff who show competence to drive. It is illegal to consume marijuana in public.",Cannabis tourism company had planned all-day party at Denver's Norad dance bar. Officials threatened to rescind liquor license of the downtown venue. Party organizer Matt Brown said it is too late to find another venue.
20924,"Proud grandfather: Bill Cassidy, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senator from Louisiana, has announced that his 17-year-old daughter is having a baby out of wedlock . A conservative Louisiana Republican seeking to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu announced Thursday that his unwed 17-year-old daughter is pregnant. Bill Cassidy, a U.S. congressman and medical doctor, is challenging Landrieu, a three-term incumbent, in a race that Republicans view as important in their quest to reclaim the U.S. Senate from Democrats. 'Earlier this year, Laura and I learned we will become grandparents this summer,' Cassidy said in a statement provided to the Times-Picayune of New Orleans. 'Our children have been the greatest blessing of our lives and we welcome our grandchild as a joyous addition to our family. 'Our daughter now faces a more challenging future than her peers. She has our unconditional love and support.' The 17-year-old mother-to-be will be a senior in Baton Rouge High School in the fall. The baby is due sometime this summer. The Cassidy campaign did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Bill Cassidy is a physician specializing in the treatment of liver disease. His wife, Laura Layden, is a retired breast cancer surgeon. The couple have three children: a son and two teenage daughters. His campaign website states that Cassidy 'works to promote the culture of life and protect the unborn.' Cassidy and Mary Landrieu, the senior U.S. senator from Louisiana, have clashed over the issue of abortion in the course of the campaign. Landrieu publicly criticized a law restricting abortion rights that was signed by Gov Bobby Jindal last month, Politico reported. The centrist Democrat explained that she has a nuanced position on the subject of abortions with the voting record to prove it. Bitter rivals: Cassidy (left) is seeking to unseat three-term incumbent Seantor Mary Landrieu, whom the GOP hopeful has described as the pro-choice candidate in a pro-life state . ‘I’ve voted against late-term abortion, I voted for access in the … pre-viability [period],’ she said. ‘Although I personally believe that life begins at conception, I believe the last place the government needs to be is in the church, in the doctor’s office or in the bedroom.’ But Bill Cassidy has disputed his opponent's position, painting her as a pro-choice candidate. ‘She has supported using U.S. taxpayer dollars for overseas abortions and most folks, even if they are pro-choice, don’t care for that,’ Cassidy said. On his part, Cassidy has backed a bill passed in the Congress that bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy on the federal level. In a recent interview, the Senate hopeful described Louisiana as a 'pro-life' state where most of the constituents are Catholics and evangelicals who support the rights of the unborn.","Bill Cassidy, a U.S. congressman and medical doctor, is seeking to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu.

9345,"Warren Gatland's unbeaten team face Grand Slam-chasing England at Twickenham on 12 March.
Prop Jenkins has a calf strain while second-row Charteris missed the 19-10 win over France with a knee injury.
""Luke Charteris is back running and Gethin Jenkins is progressing well,"" said forwards coach Robin McBryde.
Charteris missed the win over France after injuring his knee against Scotland and is not playing for his club Racing 92 this weekend.
The former Newport Gwent Dragons captain will be assessed on his return to the Wales squad on Sunday.
Record cap holder Jenkins, who made his 122nd appearance for Wales off the bench against France, has a history of calf muscle problems.
McBryde said the Cardiff Blues loose-head's experience in managing the injury means he is not ruled out of the game at Twickenham.
""It's a testament to him that he's lasted as long as he has with his re-hab,"" said McBryde.
""It's frustrating for him because he's done as much as he can to stop it happening again, but it has recurred.
""But he's more than aware what he needs to do to get himself back fit.""
Wales are hoping to complete a historic double by beating England twice at Twickenham in the same season, having won there in the 2015 World Cup in September.
McBryde believes Wales will need to be at their best against an England team who have ""a spring in their step"" after wins over Scotland, Italy and Ireland.
The former Scarlets hooker coached Wales against Japan in 2013 when Eddie Jones - now in charge of England - guided the Brave Blossoms to a 23-8 win in Tokyo to level the series 1-1.
Wales were without a number of front line players who were on tour with the British and Irish Lions in Australia, but McBryde still rates the new England coach highly.
""He's a pretty good guy, he tells it like it is and he has a wealth of knowledge,"" he said.
""They seem to have a spring in their step again there. In fairness to what Eddie's done there, the players seem to be buying in to it.
""He's won three out of three. He couldn't have hoped for a better start and momentum is on their side so it just makes it a little more difficult for us.""","Wales props Gethin Jenkins and Luke Charteris are recovering from a calf muscle injury, according to their coach."
98798,"But the #hairgate scandal that unravelled at the weekend in fact centres around a famous novelist, the Canadian prime minister and his well-groomed Liberal opponent.
It's one of several episodes in an eventful election campaign - with voting still two months away.
Writer Margaret Atwood thrust the upcoming Canadian parliamentary elections into the international media spotlight after a satirical article she wrote about Prime Minister Stephen Harper's hair (yes, hair) appeared on the National Post website, then disappeared after several hours.
It reappeared again with several lines missing, prompting the novelist to ask, ""Um, did I just get censored?""
The novelist tweeted about the mysterious disappearance of her article hours after it was first published on Friday, and soon #hairgate started to trend on Twitter.
People mocked the amount of coverage it was getting, likening it to the media attention Donald Trump has been awarded in recent weeks.
...even Margaret Atwood found time to joke about it...
A senior National Post vice-president later told The Star the article was taken down because fact-checking had not been completed and questions remained over whether it was ""aligned with the values of the National Post and its readers"".
How did the flowing locks of politicians become an election issue anyway?
It began in May - three months before the polls were even announced - when the Conservatives released a new video ad dubbed ""The Interview"" mocking the coiffure of Justin Trudeau, leader of Canada's Liberal Party.
Four people sit in a conference room mulling over CVs of candidates for a job interview (presumably the post of prime minister), ""lets talk about Justin,"" one man says. ""I see he's enclosed his picture,"" a woman on the panel responds.
They go on to question Mr Trudeau's credentials and attack his policies for being too lightweight, finally concluding he's ""just not ready"". The video ends with one panellist quipping, ""nice hair though"".
Mr Trudeau's hairstyles have long been a subject of interest in the Canadian media, with thousands of words dedicated to his thick wavy locks.
""It's a tangential way of saying he's not serious enough, that it's all about his looks and his personality and there's not enough substance to his policies. He's a celebrity not a politician or a leader, that's what they are trying to get say,"" CBC News politics producer Chris Carter tells the BBC.
In 2013, the Liberal leader decided to ditch the tousled and unkempt look for a shorter, cleaner cut, which observers in Canada interpreted as a bid for him to win the Liberal leadership contest (which he did).
Stephen Harper's hairstyle has also been under scrutiny, with comedians noting with glee how it has ""remained unchangeable and quite consistent"", says Mr Carter.
The article by Mrs Atwood that caused such a stir included the suggestion that it was Mr Harper with the hair problem and not his Liberal opponent.
One of Stephen Harper's supporters hit the headlines last week when he verbally abused a group of journalists questioning the prime minister's knowledge about an ongoing expenses scandal that dates back to 2012.
CBC reporter Hannah Thibedeau was confronted by an unnamed man who, using explicit language, told her she - and the rest of the media - was a ""lying piece of ..."" after she grilled him about the Mike Duffy case, a senator facing charges of bribery and fraud.
The self-professed Conservative supporter went on to accuse the group of journalists of lying on their tax returns, saying it amounted to the same thing as the Duffy scandal.
A Conservative spokesman later apologised, saying the man's behaviour was unacceptable, the channel reported.
In what is probably a first for any election campaign, Canada has introduced the world to its (maybe) first dragon-slaying and alien-busting politician.
Meet Wyatt Scott, an independent candidate standing in a district near Vancouver whose promotional video showcasing his extraordinary skills has received more than 1.2m views on YouTube.
In it, Mr Scott can be seen flying a giant goose, landing on a dragon and laser-eyeballing what appears to be giant robot.
It's not the only election campaign video to cause a ripple. In April, comedian Scott Vrooman published a satirical video calling the Senate a ""gilded chamber filled with corruption and sleazy back-scratching"".
He claims to be standing for the upper house despite seats there being appointed not elected.
Meanwhile, Darth Vader has entered the race. That's according to a campaign sign that appeared on a lawn in the town of Penetanguishene, Ontario, a week ago.
A picture of the ""campaign sign"",  whose slogan reads ""Darth Vader. Together we can rule the galaxy"", quickly went viral on social media, prompting some Canadians to ask where they could purchase one.
It turns out a man called Nic Gorissen created the signs after becoming frustrated by different parties pestering him to vote for them, the CTV Barrie news site reports.
But it's not the first time the dark lord of Star Wars has appeared in election campaigns. Some 16 men named Darth Vader registered to vote in Ukraine's parliamentary polls last year.
And finally, as if that wasn't enough excitement with just 55 days to go before the polls, there are rumours that the brother of Toronto's controversial former mayor, Rob Ford, may throw his hat into the ring for Conservative leadership if Stephen Harper fails in the election.
""Doug said if it's a minority government, Harper's going to step down. He wants to run for leadership,"" Rob Ford said of his brother, Doug, in an interview with Bloomberg news three days ago.
The comments drew a strong response from the Twittersphere, with some comparing Ford's possible bid for Canadian prime minister to Donald Trump's US presidential campaign.","It's a joke, it's a joke."
11584,"After discussing the vote to leave with other EU leaders, he said trade and security co-operation would be vital whatever the shape of future links.
But he said immigration was a ""great concern"" among UK voters and squaring this with access to the EU single market would be a ""huge challenge"".
Germany's Angela Merkel said the EU must ""respect the result"" of the vote.
But German politicians have insisted the UK cannot ""cherry-pick"" aspects of the EU.
Earlier on Tuesday, Chancellor Merkel said the UK must accept free movement if it wanted to retain access to the single market.
Mrs Merkel said the Brexit vote had been discussed ""very intensively and deeply"" at the dinner meeting with EU leaders.
""We all regretted the result and made clear that the legal procedure must be that the UK invokes Article 50.
""Mr Cameron said he would hand it over to the new government to do... we all agreed that before that point, there can be no formal or informal negotiations.""
Mrs Merkel said Mr Cameron expressed how he had expected a different result in the referendum, but she added that ""We are politicians; we can't spend a long time mourning"".
She also said that ""Publicly... we can see no way to turn this around. It's not a time for wishful thinking, but of contemplating the reality.""
She added that talks would be ""on the basis that we expect the representative of the UK to say what idea he has about withdrawing from the EU"".
""The request to withdraw will say what sort of relationship the UK wants. But there can be no quasi-negotiations.""
European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the UK did not have ""months to meditate"" on activating Article 50, which will trigger talks on the country's withdrawal from the EU.
""If someone from the Remain camp will become British prime minister, this has to be done in two weeks after his appointment,"" he said.
""If the next British PM is coming from the Leave campaign, it should be done the day after his appointment.""
Mr Cameron had been explaining the outcome of Britain's referendum to the EU's other 27 leaders at a meeting of the European Council, expected to be his last after he announced his intention to stand down in the wake of the Leave vote.
He told reporters the discussions had been ""calm, constructive and purposeful"".
He also said that ""while Britain is leaving the European Union, it will not, it should not and in my view it won't turn its back on Europe"".
The PM, who has said it will be up to his successor to decide how to proceed with talks on the terms of Britain's separation from the EU, said there was ""universal respect"" for the UK's decision to leave despite a ""tone of sadness and regret"".
While the EU wanted more information about the UK's negotiating plans going forward and a ""clear model appearing"", he said there was an acknowledgement that this would take some time and ""no great clamour"" for talks to begin straight away.
The prime minister warned that intransigence over freedom of movement could scupper any chance of a UK-EU trade deal with whoever takes over from him, saying there was a ""very great concern"" over immigration ""coupled with sovereignty and the ability to control these things"".
He said that he wished he had won the referendum, but it was right to hold it to try to settle the question of the UK's role in the EU.
Mr Cameron said: ""You fight for what you believe - if you win, good, If you lose, you have to accept the verdict.""
He also said Britain and the rest of the EU wanted to have the ""closest possible"" relationship as the country leaves the union.
Downing Street said his message to EU leaders was that if they want a close economic relationship with the UK after Brexit, they cannot ""shy away"" from the migration issue.
A government source said: ""He believes that one of the key issues in the referendum campaign, and therefore why a lot of people voted to leave, is this sense that there was no control on the scale of immigration and freedom of movement. That was one of the factors.""
Earlier on Tuesday, hundreds of pro-Remain supporters gathered outside Parliament to demonstrate about the consequences of Brexit.
And hundreds also turned out in Cardiff, at an event which included speeches from Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood and racial equality activist Shazia Awan.
Other rallies in Manchester and Oxford were abandoned amid fears about crowd sizes, and a protest in Liverpool was postponed until next week.",David Cameron has said he will hand over the decision to withdraw from the European Union to the new government.
91498,"""House husband"" David Harris told his partner Hazel Allinson he had become a cricket umpire and had to travel away from his Sussex home, jurors were told.
Prosecutor William Boyce QC asked Harris if he had ever been in a village cricket team, and he said he had not.
Mr Harris, 68, denies three counts of soliciting to murder Ms Allinson.
The court heard Mr Harris, a former TV producer who worked on The Bill, told Ms Allinson tales about his village cricket club involvement so he could travel to London to be with Ugne Cekaviciute, whom he had met in a brothel.
Mr Harris is accused of trying to get rid of Ms Allinson and get full ownership of the £800,000 house they shared in Amberley to run off with Ms Cekaviciute, whom he previously had admitted to being ""besotted with"" and spending £50,000 on her.
The court heard Mr Harris's ""story"" was he was too unwell to play cricket and had been persuaded to umpire - and as a driver he had to do the matches furthest from where he lived.
Cross-examining, Mr Boyce said: ""You never got the local matches. The whole thing was an elaborate lie dreamed up by you to deceive Hazel to get regular away days with Ugne.
""You would tell Hazel you were an umpire on Arundel Castle Cricket Club. It was all a complete fabrication.""
Mr Harris replied: ""It was.""
Jurors heard Mr Harris also lied to Ms Allinson that he had to support his brother in hospital while he was on ""suicide watch"".
Mr Harris said: ""That's correct. This whole thing completely blew out of proportion.""
And Mr Boyce asked him: ""You could make things up with considerable ease and make it sound convincing, couldn't you?""
Mr Harris replied: ""At times, yes.""
The defendant previously conceded he had handed over enough information for potential hitmen to find and kill Ms Allinson but insisted he was ""in control"".
Mr Boyce said: ""May I suggest this is truly absurd.
""You were recruiting these people because you were at your wits' end and could see no way out.""
But Mr Harris replied: ""Yes, I was at my wits' end. You suggest I'm a liar and deceitful but I'm not a murderer and neither would I ever consider murdering Hazel.""
The case continues.","A ""liar"" accused of trying to get rid of a woman he had been ""besotted with"" has told a court he was ""at his wits' end"" in his plot to kill her, a court has heard."
41170,"Ed Miliband knows he has a problem and can sense an opportunity.
The problem is Labour's lack of economic credibility - something every opinion poll confirms.
The opportunity is the chance to paint the Tories as not merely serious about cutting borrowing but ideologically obsessed with it.
He and Ed Balls believe that their lack of credibility is rooted not in the lack of understanding of their detailed economic policies, but in their perceived inability to say ""no"" to more spending.
Hence the headline from this speech is a warning that ""unprotected departments"" ie any other than the NHS and overseas aid, will face real cuts every year under Labour until the deficit is cleared.
What either of the Eds could have said today is that their alternative approach to the economy would allow them to borrow a lot more and spend more, at least in the short term.
This is because they are only committed to balancing the CURRENT deficit so can still borrow for capital or investment spending.
In addition they have said they will clear the deficit as soon as possible - which sounds tough but allows them two or three years more than the current coalition plan.
Ed Miliband's five principles of deficit reduction - spelt out in today's speech - are a restatement of his existing rhetoric.
The most important one captures his belief that if the next government helps deliver higher wages - through the living wage, skills programmes, crackdowns on the abuse of the low paid etc - they will be rewarded with a higher tax take and, therefore, less borrowing.
His analysis - shared by many economists - is that the Tories have been running very fast on cuts only to find themselves with borrowing barely moving.
The strategic aim of ""the speech that remembered the deficit"" is not just to convince wavering voters that Labour is serious about cutting borrowing, but to allow them to argue that, unlike their opponents, they won't risk public services or the the public finances when they do it.
One thing the speech, as briefed, does not contain is any new example of how Labour would actually cut spending.
UPDATE 1:20pm: The 1930s comparison was made first not by Labour or the BBC but by the OBR so is not spurious BUT - and it is a BIG but - it refers to one thing and one thing only - the SHARE of the national cake taken by spending on public services
It allows Labour to hint that it's back to the soup kitchens and kids with no shoes with the Tories which it isn't because it is ALSO true that spending in real terms under the Tory plan will end up the same as it was in 2002.
Just as the 1930s isn't as terrifying as it might at first sound, the 2002 comparison isn't as reassuring because since then the population's got bigger and older and demands more in the way of health & social services etc
Another way to look at the same thing is to ask whether we're getting more like America or Singapore who spend around 35% of their GDP on the state or more like Germany or Scandinavian countries that spend in the mid 40s.",The Conservatives have a problem with borrowing and the opportunity to paint them as ideologically obsessed with it.

95260,"David Cameron is delaying a controversial appointment by Speaker John Bercow over fears it could ‘embarrass the Queen’. Government sources said the Prime Minister was effectively sitting on Mr Bercow’s decision to appoint Australian catering manager Carol Mills to the £200,000-a-year post of Clerk of the Commons, in charge of running Parliament. Mr Bercow’s selection has been criticised by MPs on all sides, warning that Miss Mills lacks the knowledge to advise Parliament on constitutional matters. Scroll down for video . Commons Speaker John Bercow is under pressure to let MPs grill the Australian Parliamentary aide Carol Mills, who is the front runner to become the new House of Commons clerk . No 10 yesterday confirmed the Prime Minister had not forwarded the nomination to the Queen for approval, despite having had it for at least ten days. A spokesman said: ‘It is an important role and for the individual to be able to carry it out successfully, they need support from MPs across the Commons.’ The comments come after senior MPs raised concerns over Ms Mills's lack of knowledge about Westminster procedures. The prestigious £200,000-a-year post combines the clerk's duties as a key constitutional adviser with the role of Commons chief executive. In an effort to defuse the row, Mr Bercow has indicated he wants to split the functions into two jobs as soon as possible. The suggestion has failed to appease critics who are planning a potentially damaging showdown with the Speaker when the Commons returns from its summer break next week. There have been calls for a confirmation hearing before a committee, and a motion could be tabled in the House to force the issue. Ms Mills, currently head of the Department of Parliamentary Services in Canberra, was recommended for the role earlier this month following an open recruitment process with a selection panel led by Mr Bercow. He is believed to be keen to bring in an outsider to press ahead with modernisation of the House, rather than promoting deputy clerk David Natzler. The Prime Minister is responsible for passing the recommendation to the Queen to be finalised. The text of a motion that could potentially be tabled by Tory backbencher Jesse Norman next week has been circulated. Reports suggest up to 50 MPs have already pledged to support it. It would apparently stop short of demanding Ms Mills appointment be abandoned, merely insisting there should be a confirmation hearing. The mooted text reads: ‘That this House believes that the recommendation of Ms Carol Mills to be Clerk of this House should be subject to, and contingent upon, a pre-appointment hearing and report by a select committee.’ Mr Bercow has been under mounting pressure to delay the appointment. Former foreign secretaries Jack Straw and Margaret Beckett last week added their voices to a cross-party campaign to let MPs grill Mr Bercow’s top choice to become the next House of Commons clerk. It came after Ms Mills finally broke her silence over the controversy surrounding her proposed appointment. Former Foreign Secretaries Margaret Beckett and Jack Straw have called for Ms Mills to appear in front of a Parliamentary committee to scrutinise her appointment . Ms Mills, a senior aide in the Australian Parliament in Canberra, said she was ‘disappointed’ that colleagues in Australia had declared that she had ‘no parliamentary knowledge or experience’. It came after an email was leaked from the Australian clerk of the Senate, Rosemary Laing, to the Commons authorities which warned against her appointment. Responding to the memo Ms Mills said: ‘It would not be appropriate for me to comment further in a personal capacity at this time,’ she said. ‘As a senior parliamentary officer, I take seriously my responsibilities to promote and uphold the values and code of conduct articulated in the Commonwealth of Australia Parliamentary Service Act 1999.’ Ms Laing apparently cited an incident in which CCTV cameras were used in the Australian Parliament to track someone pushing an envelope under the door of a senator's office late at night. The episode is being investigated, as cameras are supposed to be used only for security and to prosecute illegal activity. But Ms Mills said her Department of Parliamentary Services ‘looks forward to the opportunity to explain to the committee the basis of its view that use of the CCTV footage was in fact authorised, and wholly consistent with parliamentary privilege’.",David Cameron is delaying decision to nominate Carol Mills as Commons clerk.

2544,"Fifty-five years after Maria Ridulph vanished from a small-town street corner while playing in the snow, a former neighbor was sentenced to life in prison for kidnapping and killing the brown-eyed second-grader. Jack Daniel McCullough, who was 17 and known as John Tessier back in 1957, was finally identified two years ago by Maria's childhood companion as ""Johnny,"" the blond man with the ducktail haircut who offered the girls piggyback rides and carried Maria off into oblivion. McCullough, who worked as a police officer for a time in Washington state, was convicted of child abduction and murder after a two-week trial in September. He continues to assert his innocence. In court Monday, McCullough claimed he was framed by corrupt police and prosecutors. He pointed at a white box on the defense table that he said contained 4,000 pages of FBI reports from 1957. He said agents interviewed 1,800 people and cleared him. And then, his hand still resting on the box, he urged the judge, ""Your honor, in the name of justice and fairness, open the box and view the truth."" Judge James Hallock had ruled the documents inadmissible at McCullough's trial. The case is believed by investigators to be the oldest cold case to go to trial and result in a conviction. McCullough was sentenced under laws that were in effect in 1957. Suspect in 1957 cold case charged as fugitive . After the 90-minute hearing, snowflakes fell on Ridulph's brother, Charles, and sister, Patricia Quinn, as they stood on the courthouse steps and said they were relieved Maria had finally received justice. ""This has been a nightmare for our family,"" Charles Ridulph said. Quinn added that the crime ""changed Sycamore. People were afraid."" McCullough, now 73, was questioned during the first days of the investigation but was never considered a suspect because he seemed to have the perfect alibi: He and his parents said he was miles away in Rockford, enlisting in the Air Force and taking a physical. He left Sycamore days after Maria's disappearance and served in the Air Force and then the Army. He was stationed for a time in Vietnam, rose to the rank of captain and was awarded the Bronze star for bravery in combat, his lawyer said. The murder case went cold, but Sycamore never forgot about Maria Ridulph. On the 40th anniversary of her disappearance, a monument was erected outside Sycamore's police station. It says, in part: ""This is in memory of Maria Ridulph who on December 3, 1957, was kidnapped while playing near her home. She was found murdered in the spring of 1958. This also is in honor of the great people in our community that reached out in love and compassion."" McCullough's youngest sister, a baby at the time of the crime, contacted an Illinois State Police tip line in 2008 and told investigators that her dying mother had pulled her close in her hospital room years earlier and, referring to Ridulph's murder, said, ""John did it. John did it, and you have to tell someone."" Janet Tessier added that her mother was agitated and emotional at the time and ""expressed a great deal of guilt,"" according to a transcript obtained by CNN. After state police reopened the case, they interviewed a former girlfriend in Florida and eventually poked holes in McCullough's alibi. A government-issued train ticket fell out of the back of a photograph the woman mailed to police, and an expert authenticated the ticket and said it had not been used. Kathy Sigman Chapman, who was playing with Maria the night she was abducted, picked that photo of McCullough out of a police lineup in September 2010. Although she had viewed hundreds, if not thousands, of photos before, it was the first time she'd been able to identify ""Johnny."" She testified that she was certain she had identified the right man. Illinois girl's body exhumed in 1957 slaying . The girls had been excited as the first snowflakes of the season fell on the evening of December 3, 1957, Chapman recalled. They asked to go back outside after dinner. The Tessier family lived around the corner and two blocks down Center Cross Street from Archie Place, where the girls' families lived. Because he was older, Maria and Kathy did not know John Tessier, a high school dropout. ""Johnny"" asked the girls if they liked dolls and if they'd like to ride in a truck, bus or train. Maria ran home and returned with a favorite doll. Then Chapman left Maria alone with Johnny and went home to fetch her mittens. When she came back, they were both gone. She alerted Maria's brother, Charles. A massive search began, which continued throughout December. Maria's doll was found by a neighbor's garage. The missing child case drew dozens of FBI agents to this small farming community about 60 miles west of Chicago. FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover demanded daily updates, which were shared with President Dwight Eisenhower. The disappearance of the 7-year-old with the perfect Sunday school attendance was national news for a while as 1,000 volunteers scoured fields of corn stubble for clues. Maria's remains were found in the spring by a retired couple looking for mushrooms under the melting snow. She was 120 miles from home, in a field near the town of Galena and not far from a river campground where the Tessier family spent vacations.","Jack Daniel McCullough was convicted of kidnapping and murder in 1957.

99138,"By . Steve Robson . PUBLISHED: . 12:18 EST, 11 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:34 EST, 11 June 2013 . Jailed: Mark Cox, 22, was jailed for three years after pleading guilty to burglary, possessing a CS gas weapon and possessing a police uniform today . A police officer’s son who broke into a women's house and stole 50 pairs of knickers has been jailed for three years. Mark Cox, 22, stole a set of house keys belonging to former school friend Emma Pinches, 21, after attending a party at her Northampton home in February. The hospital porter then used the keys to let himself in to the property while Ms Pinches was out and steal her underwear. The call centre worker became suspicious when she gradually noticed items of lingerie were missing over the next couple of weeks. She only suspected Cox may be behind the thefts when she received a text from him on March 2 to ask whether she would be out with her boyfriend that evening. Police then searched Cox’s home in Northampton and found ‘vast quantities’ of women’s underwear under his bed. Officers also discovered CS gas spray as well as a police helmet, handcuffs, jacket and stab vest. Last month Cox pleaded guilty to two counts of burglary, one count of possessing a weapon designed for the discharge of CS gas and possessing a police uniform. Magistrates heard he bought the police uniform as 'memorabilia' because his father and grandfather were both police officers. He has since received counselling in a bid to overcome his underwear addiction. Cox was jailed for three years at Northampton Crown Court today. Rumbled: Ms Pinches suspected Cox was responsible for the underwear thefts after he texted her asking if she would be going out with her boyfriend one night . Sentencing him, Judge Rupert Mayo, said: 'I take a very dim view of this crime. I’m not concerned about your fetish or what you stole. 'I’m concerned about how you planned this burglary by taking her keys, and how you made sure she was out when you visited her home. 'The fact this was almost a stalker-like relationship makes it altogether worse.' Cox had told the court he bought the police uniform items off eBay to use for role play sex with his ex-girlfriend. He admitted he had an underwear fetish and regularly bought knickers and bras from Ann Summers. Prosecuting Jenna Allen told the court: 'When police searched his home they found vast quantities of ladies underwear. 'Ms Pinches' DNA was found on the knickers, after Mr Cox claimed he bought them all himself. Underwear: Defence said that the actions were driven by a fetish but that he had not vandalised the property . 'When Mr Cox was questioned by police, he claimed he worked as an officer with Thames Valley police. 'This later turned out to be a lie, showing there are sinister undertones in his behaviour.' At an earlier hearing magistrates were told the items were stolen at a time when Cox was being 'driven by a fetish' for women’s underwear. Defending, Maxine Krone said: 'He knows he has done wrong and has never offended before. 'Despite his crimes I can’t see how he would pose a threat to anyone'. Speaking after the sentence Ms Pinches said: 'I’m shocked - it’s a longer sentence than I was expecting. 'I do feel sorry for his family but he deserved to be punished for what he did to me. From what police told me, Mark wasn’t remorseful when he was initially caught. 'I don’t know how he feels now, but hopefully this sentence will teach him a lesson and he won’t try it again. 'No one else should have to go through it. The idea of it still creeps me out. I’m just happy it has all come to a close and I can move on with my life.'","Mark Cox, 22, stole house keys from Emma Pinches, 21, in Northampton.

53778,"Liz Nicholl told BBC Sport her organisation was not responsible for standards at the governing body because ""we don't live in the velodrome"".
But she did admit UK Sport could have been ""more inquisitive"".
Nicholl also said British Cycling had been ""courageous"" to apologise after bullying and sexism allegations.
An independent investigation into the culture at British Cycling began last year after former riders complained about their treatment.
A report on the findings has been delayed for legal reasons, but publication is imminent.
And a 39-point 'action plan' of reforms overhauling governance and welfare policies has now been introduced.
The credibility of British Cycling was left ""in tatters"" according to one MP this week, after revelations that no records were kept of medical treatments for riders.
Nicholl said she was ""shocked and disturbed"" by the failure, and that there were various ""fires"" at the governing body.
""This is a governing body that has not had its eye on culture and behaviours,"" she said.
""But it is listening, and has committed to actions that should address that, so I'm optimistic for the future.""

The controversy comes with UK Sport facing scrutiny over its removal of funding for various sports, including badminton and wheelchair rugby.
The latter has started a crowd-funding campaign to replace the £3m it lost.
UK Sport has warned British Cycling the £26m it is due to receive for elite performance leading up to the Tokyo 2020 Games is now in jeopardy, although it has previously held the organisation up as a flagship for other sports.
However, Nicholl denied her organisation's 'no-compromise' strategy may be partly responsible for a 'win-at-all-costs' culture at the troubled governing body, and that there should have been more oversight.
""We fund 36 other sports... we provide support and guidance, we check, we challenge, but we don't live in the velodrome,"" said Nicholl, who last week accused British Cycling of feeding UK Sport ""a very light-touch version"" of a 2012 internal review.
""If there's a perception, then I will apologise to anybody who thinks we may have had a part to play in that.
""Could we have been more inquisitive? Yes. But we're an investor, and not embedded in any sport. We're only as good as the information that is shared with us.""

With other sports now being asked to improve their governance and duty of care towards athletes and staff, Nicholl was asked if she would be prepared for Britain to win fewer medals if the focus shifted from winning to welfare.
""There won't be less success,"" she said. ""If you address duty of care there will be more success because you create an environment which is very positive, so I think we'll see the results getting better.""
The review into British Cycling's culture began last year after former technical director Shane Sutton, who was later cleared of eight of nine allegations, was found to have used sexist language towards cyclist Jess Varnish.
Varnish, 26, was dropped from British Cycling's elite programme in April, and says she has been frustrated in her attempts to find out why.
She has not yet given up hope of resuming her career.
British Cycling chairman Jonathan Browning told BBC Sport: ""She is absolutely open to re-entering the programme. There's no restriction in terms of Jess' ability.""","British Cycling's chief executive has said she is ""optimistic"" for the future of the sport, despite the failure to improve its culture."

And so far Windows Phone owners have had to live without a similar feature to the one that Apple rolled out in October 2011. But a video that claims to show Microsoft’s forthcoming digital assistant has been leaked online. Scroll down for video . The leaked video shows Microsoft's digital assistant, called Cortana, running on what seems to be a Windows Phone 8.1 handset (pictured) Windows Phone 8.1 is the upcoming third generation of Microsoft's Windows Phone mobile operating system. It is expected to be unveiled next month and is rumoured to feature a swipe-down notification centre and the Siri-like personal assistant, according to The Verge. The digital assistant is expected to be called Cortana and this video leak adds weight to the rumour. Cortana is said to be poised to replace Bing Search. Just like Apple's Siri, users will be able to talk to it and ask questions. The assistant has a start-up process that asks users lots of questions to tailor its suggestions from the onset. Windows Phone 8.1 is expected to make its debut at the Build Developer Conference in April, where it is rumoured that Nokia will also launch two new Windows Phone handsets. The UnleashThePhones video shows Microsoft's assistant, called Cortana, running on what seems to be a Windows Phone 8.1 handset. Microsoft describes the personal assistant as ‘a personal assistant on your phone, ready to help with reminders, suggestions, tasks and lots more’. Cortana seems to make use of location, voice input, text messages email information and contacts as well as browser and search history to learn about a user’s habits after they sign into their Microsoft account. It asks questions such as ‘What are a . couple of the most enjoyable parts of your everyday evenings?’ and ‘When . you think about food, what’s most important to you these days?’ so it . can offer tailored suggestions. This . set-up feature is different to Apple’s Siri or Google’s Now, which asks . questions to tweak suggestions later on instead of asking a user’s . preferences from the outset.

The website claims that the assistant is still ‘a work in progress’ so its appearance may change.

Similar Montana and New Mexico court rulings are based on judicial decision and do not mention a time line. Mandated by State Law: . Oregon . Vermont . Washington . Mandated by Court Ruling: . Montana . New Mexico - Bernalillo County only . Other Facts: . The specific method in each state varies, but mainly involves a prescription from a licensed physician approved by the state in which the patient is a resident. Physician-assisted suicide differs from euthanasia, which is defined as the act of assisting people with their death in order to end their suffering, but without the backing of a controlling legal authority. In Oregon, ""the physician must be a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) or Doctor of Osteopathy (D.O.) licensed to practice medicine by the Board of Medical Examiners for the State of Oregon. The physician must also be willing to participate in the Act."" In Vermont, ""only a doctor of medicine or osteopathy licensed to practice medicine in Washington may write this prescription...A physician, nurse, pharmacist, or other person shall not be under any duty, by law or contract, to participate in the provision of a lethal dose of medication to a patient."" In Washington, ""only a doctor of medicine or osteopathy licensed to practice medicine in Washington may write this prescription...participation is entirely voluntary. Health care providers are not required to provide prescriptions or medications to qualified patients."" Statistics: . The process of reporting applications and deaths also varies by state. Only those states where physician-assisted suicide is mandated by law have a reporting process. Oregon has had a physician-assisted suicide law on the books since 1997, and has shown a steady increase in both prescription recipients and the number of deaths. At its height, in the year 2012, 85 deaths from physician-assisted suicide were reported. According to the 2013 annual report, since 1997, prescriptions have been written for 1,173 people and there have been 752 reported deaths. Washington - According to the 2013 annual report, since 2009 prescriptions have been written for 549 people and there have been 525 reported deaths. Vermont - Since May 2013, physician reporting forms have been completed for two people, according to the Department of Health. Timeline: . June 1997 - The U.S. Supreme Court rules that state laws banning physician-assisted suicide do not violate the Constitution in the case Washington v. Glucksberg. The court left the matter of the constitutionality of a right to a physician's aid in dying to the states. October 27, 1997 - Oregon's Death with Dignity Act becomes law. Passed in a 1994 election with 51% of voters in favor, the law was delayed initially because U.S. District Judge Michael Hogan issued an injunction and then ruled it unconstitutional. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling and the injunction was lifted when the U.S. Supreme Court referred the matter back to the state in 1997. November 1998 - American pathologist and assisted suicide advocate, Jack Kevorkian, known as ""Dr. Death,"" videotapes the death of Thomas Youk, submits it to CBS's 60 Minutes, and it is broadcast on television.

23027,"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been frozen in the public mind by four images. There's the surveillance photo that the FBI says shows him carrying a backpack among the people who thronged the finish line of last year's Boston Marathon -- a backpack that federal agents say held one of the bombs that killed three people and maimed more than 200, severing limbs from many of them. There's the one of a blood-smeared Tsarnaev staggering from beneath a tarp on a trailered boat as a small army of law enforcement holds him in its sights. That ended the pursuit that began when the FBI handed out the first picture. Then there's the gauzy image of a placid, tousle-haired teenager that appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone three months later. That one sparked outrage among many of the survivors and prompted numerous outlets to pull the issue, which featured a lengthy profile of the suspect. And there's the one from his last public appearance -- a sketch of Tsarnaev in an orange jumpsuit standing in a courtroom, repeating ""not guilty"" to the litany of charges against him. As the dignitaries and the survivors and the rescuers gathered in Boston on Tuesday afternoon to mark the anniversary of the bombing, Tsarnaev was sitting in a cell on a former Army installation about 35 miles away. He's scheduled to go to trial in early November, when prosecutors will ask a jury to put him on death row. His lawyers have laid the groundwork for a case that argues that Tsarnaev, now 20, was under the ""domination and control"" of his brother Tamerlan, who was killed in the chase. His defense team is led by a lawyer known for cutting deals to spare the lives of her most notorious clients. But they're facing long odds, said New York lawyer Ronald Tabak, a leading expert on capital cases. ""They're up against the huge amount of pretrial publicity, the negative nature of most of that publicity and the fact that this was a crime that affected the entire area,"" he said. Even if the defense can convince the jury that most of the blame lies with Tsarnaev's dead brother, ""They still have to deal with several people being killed and many other people being injured for no reason that would make sense to just about anybody, other than someone who was mentally ill or believed in terrorism,"" Tabak said. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was seven years older, a onetime Golden Gloves boxing champion and an increasingly radical adherent of Islam, according to associates. Investigators say the Tsarnaev brothers tried to bolt from Boston after the FBI released their pictures on April 18, killing a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer in the process. Tamerlan was run over by his kid brother as they battled police who were closing in, according to the indictment against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. In the past year, investigators also linked Tamerlan to the slayings of three men in a Boston suburb a year and a half before the bombings. It was a particularly grisly scene: The heads of the three victims were pulled back and their throats slit ear to ear with great force, marijuana was spread over the bodies in what investigators called a symbolic gesture, and several thousand dollars in cash was left at the apartment. In court papers, Dzhokhar's lawyers argued that the killings demonstrated that his brother ""was an all-powerful force who could not be ignored or disobeyed."" They've also raised questions about whether Tamerlan suffered from mental illness and suggested his ""paranoia and distress"" were fueled by an FBI attempt to recruit him as an informant. The government responded last week that it has no evidence agents ever tried to recruit Tamerlan. It says Dzhokhar Tsarnaev downloaded jihadist literature to his computer, including the first issue of al Qaeda's Inspire magazine -- the one that shows how to build a bomb from a pressure cooker, the type of weapon used on Boylston Street. The indictment against him describes how the brothers test-fired guns and bought fireworks that held 8 pounds of explosives. And it recounts the messages scrawled inside the boat where Dzhokhar was found -- messages that accused the United States of killing ""innocent civilians"" and warned, ""Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop."" The Tsarnaev family originally came from Chechnya, a war-torn corner of southwestern Russia where Islamist guerrillas have been battling government forces for a decade and a half. Both brothers were born in Kyrgyzstan; Dzhokhar had become an American citizen, while Tamerlan's application was still pending when the bombing occurred. In 2011, Russian intelligence had asked the FBI to keep tabs on Tamerlan, who had become an increasingly devout Muslim. The FBI said Moscow believed ""that he was a follower of radical Islam"" and was preparing to head for Russia ""to join unspecified underground groups."" FBI agents checked out the tip, found no information linking Tamerlan to terrorism and asked the Russians to let them know if they had anything else to support their claims, according to an inspector general's report released last week. There was no response, the report concluded. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers might be able to spare their client's life if they can show jurors that Tamerlan held ""an unusual sway"" over his brother, Tabak said. They might also be helped by the fact that the state of Massachusetts hasn't had capital punishment since 1984, indicating that jurors drawn from the state are less likely to put someone to death, he said. But because this is a federal case, the jury will be drawn from a broader pool -- and that pool may include more conservative suburban or rural residents who are more inclined to support executions, said Tabak, who leads the death penalty committee of the American Bar Association's Section of Individual Rights and Responsibilities. In the meantime, Tsarnaev awaits his date with a jury. And in Boston, a grim anniversary will soon give way to another year's marathon.

Fox, who is playing French statesman Charles de Gaulle in The Patriotic Traitor, stopped acting, swore back and refused to continue.
But he told Radio 4's Today programme he was sorry and should have dealt with the situation better.
""Can I just start by apologising to the other 199 people in the theatre for my use of language,"" said Fox on Thursday's programme.
""It was a very emotional part of the play and I was very upset about it and am upset about how I behaved.""
The Patriotic Traitor centres on the relationship between French president de Gaulle and the politician Philippe Petain, played by Tom Conti, during World War Two.
Formerly close friends, the two men ended up on opposite sides in the conflict.
Fox told Today that the audience member had ""started muttering and heckling"" early on in the play.
""It became so loud and impossible to deal with,"" the actor explained.
But he went on to acknowledge that he should have handled things in a different way rather than start swearing himself.
""I really should have had a little speech prepared and gone: 'Excuse me sir, you can either leave, or whatever'. But instead, in the heightened emotion of the thing, I told him to erâ€¦""
Fox added: ""The dynamic of the theatre and the storytelling process to me seems that there is a fourth wall through which the audience watch... therefore if someone is hell-bent on heckling they are ruining it for everybody... it becomes an unperformable play.""
Fox said he had spoken to his actor father James after the performance, who had advised him to ""prepare a little speech"" and speak to any disruptive audience member politely.
The actor said Wednesday's audience had been ""very nervous"" as a result of his outburst the previous night.
Fox is a member of the famous acting dynasty that includes his father James, best known for The Servant and Downton Abbey.
His uncle Edward is famous for, among other things, starring in 1973 movie The Day Of The Jackal and also portraying King Edward VIII in ITV's Edward & Mrs Simpson.  Fox's cousin Emilia is the star of Silent Witness on BBC One and her brother Freddie is known for Cucumber on Channel 4.

A man has been arrested for defacing national monument Pompeys Pillar after he etched a love message just three feet from the historic Captain William Clark’s signature, made in 1806. The carving, which reads ‘Cole + Shpresa 10/10/2013’ with a love heart, was found by shocked deputies at the famous monument in Montana. Ignoring the warning signs, security cameras and railings, a man from Minnesota admitted to the crime, which has been described as a ‘senseless act of vandalism’. 'Senseless vandalism': A man has been arrested for creating this graffiti, found just three feet from the 1806 signature of Captain William Clark which made Pomeys Pillar a landmark . The man, who had been visiting the tourist attraction with his wife, now faces charges under federal law which protects national monuments. The 1806 signature is one of the last remaining pieces of physical evidence of the Lewis and Clark expedition, the first explorers to cross the western region of America. Jonathan Peart, the director of Friends of Pompeys Pillar, told 3KRTV.com: ‘This belongs to all of us - to you, to me to every American out there and to deface this is just a senseless act of vandalism and violence to something that has historical and cultural importance.’ National monument: Deputies were alarmed to find the carving so close to this historical etching, one of the last remaining pieces of physical evidence of the Lewis and Clark expedition . A silent alarm alerted Bureau of Land Management (BLM) deputies that someone had climbed over the guard rail on October 10. A man and a woman were questioned and their contact details recorded but it was not until a week later that the love message was found by an employee. Reviewing security footage, the suspected culprit was soon found according to Peart. He said: ‘These National treasures should be treated with respect and those who don't need to be punished.’ The man is yet to be officially identified as the BLM continues to investigate. According to WDEF.com, Montana/Dakotas BLM spokesman Melodie Lloyd said that the suspect had been apprehended and charges are yet to be filed. Historical importance: The man faces felony charges for defacing Pomeys Pillar (pictured), a 150-foot sandstone butte in the Yellowstone Valley . To remove the graffiti will cost between $4,000 and $5,000, according to the Friends of Pompeys Pillar. The monument is open to the public on foot every day of the year but barriers restrict visitor access to the signature. Captain William Clark scrawled his name and the date, July 25, 1806, on the 150-foot sandstone butte in the Yellowstone Valley after his return to America. The signature looks as it did some 200 years ago. The monument, 25 miles northeast of Billings, Montana, attracts some 50,000 every year. It was named a national monument in 2001.

AUSTRIA'S exclusive Swarovski crystals firm has been accused of profiting from the forced labour of teenaged girls living in Austrian care homes during the 1960s. The company, beloved of celebrities ranging from David Beckham to Paris Hilton and Jennifer Lopez to Nicole Kidman, says it has ordered an urgent independent enquiry into the allegations which surfaced in Austrian news reports this week. The claims state that the youngsters at the notorious St. Martin state-run care home near the Swarovski Austrian plant at Schwaz were employed to do 'piece work' on the crystals which are used in jewellery, fashion accessories and clothing. Reports stated they were paid next to nothing for their efforts. Forced labour: Swarovski has been accused of profiting from the forced labour of girls doing 'piece work' on crystals to be used in jewellery and fashion accessories . One girl - now aged 61 and identified as Johanna P. in an account in Austrian daily Kurier - claimed: ‘I was given a box with lots of little stones, tiny crystal stones. I had to lay the stones on pre-designed templates. ‘We worked from seven or eight in the morning until five or six in the evening. It was assembly line work. I do not remember getting a penny for my work.’ The homes housed many girls who had been sent there by their parents because they were unmarried teenage mothers. A former resident identified only as Hermine R. said: ‘It was exploitation of these young mothers. It was made out to be good work, but it was piece work. Love the bling: Celebrities around the world adorn their bodies, accessories and homes with Swarovski crystals including Katie Price, left, who has crystal studded tiara, piano and TV and Paris Hilton, right, who has a crystal encrusted mobile phone . ‘You would have expected youngsters . like us to have been paid good money but it was all collected by the . bosses who ran the place. 'This was exploitation of young girls who at 16 had become mothers and were assigned there by their parents or the state.’ The last names of both women were witheld from reports in accordance with Austrian media laws regarding privacy. The . reports stated that between 20 and 25 ‘nimble fingered’ girls were . employed on the Swarovski assembly line out of the factory and that most . of the work for the girls aged between 15 and 18 was implanting . crystals on to straps. St. Martin earned notoriety because of its strict regime and the fact that . the only 'crime' that most of its inhabitants had committed was falling . pregnant in the strictly Catholic region. Following . the report on Tuesday it emerged that two other Austrian companies - a . jam and marmalade making concern called Darbo and a light bulb . manufacturer - also took advantage of the cheap labour which was . arranged though the offices of the local authority before a stop was put . to it entirely. Encrusted mp3: David Beckham, pictured with wife Victoria, has an mp3 player that is studded with 12,000 Swarovski crystals . Swarovski board spokesman Markus Langes-Swarovski said an independent historian will be appointed to probe the claims. He said: ‘This has made me very concerned. I know nothing of such charges in connection with Swarovski thus far. 'An independent historian will be entrusted with the search for the facts.’ Swarovski is beloved the world over by admirers of bling: as well as necklaces, earrings and watches adorned with the firm's crystals, David Beckham has an mp3 player that is encrusted with 12,000 Swarovski crystals. Paris Hilton has a cellular phone encrusted with them while Jennifer Lopez's wedding band of white gold encrusted with Swarovski sparklers while Nicole Kidman appeared on the red carpet of the 2008 Oscars wearing a necklace that was a combination of diamonds and Swarovski crystals.

8081,"Building Design Magazine said judges failed to see how University College London's building on Caledonian Road was ""fit for human occupation"".
It said the majority of rooms lack adequate daylight, offer little privacy and a significant number have no direct view out at all.
UCL said the building complied with all necessary planning regulations.
The magazine's annual Carbuncle Cup competition claims to recognise the worst architectural projects.
Designed by Stephen George and Partners for UCL, judges said what was once a historic red brick warehouse has now been largely demolished despite being protected.
It said: ""The original frontage has been retained in a cynical gesture towards preservation.
""But its failings go deeper: this is a building that the jury struggled to see as remotely fit for human occupation.""
Executive editor and Carbuncle Cup juror Ellis Woodman added: ""There is no small irony in the fact that the building stands on the same street as HMP Pentonville.""
The runner-up for the Carbuncle Cup, Castle Mill housing at Oxford University, is also student accommodation, while Redcar Beacon - also known as the Vertical Pier - came third.
Islington Council had refused planning permission for UCL's building, however that was overturned by the inspectorate.
Councillor Paul Convery, who chaired the council committee which turned down the planning application, said permission was refused for reasons including the poor quality of the design and the poor quality of amenity for students.
""We were very disappointed that the government inspector overturned the council's decision and granted planning permission for this building.""
UCL said: ""A challenging aspect of the building design was the need for us to incorporate the faÃ§ade, which is listed, into an appropriate hall of residence.
""The design evolved through in-depth and extensive consultation with Islington Council's planning, conservation and urban design officers and we are happy with the outcome.
""The final design complies with all necessary planning regulations in respect of outlook, amenity and natural daylight.""","A student accommodation building on the same street as HMP Pentonville has been judged as ""retrofit for human occupation""."

It is over additional payments for tasks which the janitors say are ""dirty, unpleasant, involve regularly working outside or heavy lifting"".
Janitors first walked out in March and are set for further action on 20 April.
Cordia said they had given Unison three opportunities to outline their issues and that the matter was considered by a committee before being rejected.
A spokesman for the facilities company said: ""Cordia has completely exhausted all internal processes after negotiations with Unison and is not required to convene a meeting to further negotiate when at this stage there is no possibility of a settlement.""
But Unison said janitors were entitled to the Working Context and Demands Payment which ranges from about £500 to more than £1,000.
Sam Macartney, Unison branch officer, said: ""We want justice for jannies in Glasgow.
""The city's parents, carers and the wider public will be rightly astonished that the employer is refusing to even meet these hard-working janitors and their trade union.""
Industrial action over the payment began on 19 January when janitors began boycotting a number of duties.
Unison said Cordia were using ""spurious arguments"" to justify not awarding the payment.","Janitors in Glasgow are set to go on strike over a new payment for their ""dirty, unpleasant"" duties."

Reading's inconsistent season sees them lie 15th in the second tier, with little hope of reaching the play-off places.
Manager Steve Clarke was dismissed earlier in the campaign and former Royals boss Brian McDermott was brought back.  Although he has struggled to make an impact in the league, McDermott has guided the club to their fourth FA Cup quarter-final in seven seasons.
The hard-working Hal Robson-Kanu missed two clear opportunities - a first-half header was tipped over by Baggies keeper Ben Foster and he shot agonisingly wide after running clear in injury time.
Despite falling behind, the hosts continued to battle and earned their reward through two set pieces, both of which were headed home, as well as a neatly taken third.
In a largely forgettable opening 45 minutes, the two sides mustered just one shot on target but the match livened up considerably in the second once former Manchester United man Fletcher had struck the first goal.
However, West Brom's poor run at Reading continues, the Midlanders having failed to win away to the Berkside side for 11 straight games - a sequence stretching back to January 1995.
The Baggies were outplayed for large spells by their Football League opponents and can now concentrate on survival in the top flight, where they sit eight points above the relegation zone.
At the final whistle, Chris Brunt went over to the stand in which the visiting supporters were housed and was hit in the face by a coin. The midfielder remonstrated angrily with the crowd and had to be ushered off the pitch by captain Fletcher.

Matthew Lawton was shopping with his wife Amanda, 38, and his son Bradley at an Iceland store in Sheffield, when he claims a security guard asked them to leave. Mr Lawton claims his autistic son had been putting his hands in the freezers and was running up and down the aisles in the store. Iceland contends Bradley was potentially endangering himself and other customers 'by striking the lids of freezer cabinets while wearing a heavy ring'. Matthew Lawton, pictured with his wife Amanda and his son Bradley, seven, have claimed 'discrimination' after they were asked to leave an Iceland store in Sheffield because their son, who has autism, was running around the store and putting his hands in freezers; the family has been given a £20 voucher from Iceland . The Iceland store in The Moor, Sheffield, where the Lawton family was asked to leave by store security . The 40-year-old claims the security guard at the store on The Moor, accused him of not being able to control Bradley. He said: 'I am absolutely furious. He wasn't in a bad meltdown, but to be told you can't control your son is absolutely disgraceful. I couldn't believe it.' Mr Lawton said he explained to the security guard that his son had autism, and later called Iceland's head office to complain.The store sent him a £20 voucher. Mr Lawton said: 'I want to use the incident to raise awareness of disabled discrimination. 'Because Bradley doesn't need a wheelchair, people sometimes don't realise his condition. 'I'm very passionate about the fact that awareness isn't there and often it's the older generation that frown or don't seem to understand.' Mr Lawton said his family had suffered 'discrimination'. Iceland has said that it is investigating the incident and will take 'any action that may be appropriate'; pictured above is The Moor Market, where the Iceland store is located . He said: 'When you have someone in that job, you have to have an awareness about what you can and can't say. It's discrimination. 'I think we're a little bit behind in this country.' A spokesman for Iceland said the company is 'opposed to all forms of discrimination'. 'We are well aware of, and sympathetic to, the issues faced by the parents of autistic children and we try our utmost to make allowances for sometimes challenging behaviour in store. However, we must also have regard for the safety of our other customers and staff.' The spokesman said a security guard approached the Lawtons and asked them 'to calm' Bradley down and warned they they would have to leave the store if they couldn't. Iceland gave the family a £20 voucher, the spokesman said, as a 'gesture of goodwill'. 'We offered them as a gesture of goodwill and have already returned to shop in the same store, and we hope to see them and their son in store many times again in the future.' Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a condition that affects social interaction, communication, interests and behaviour. It includes Asperger syndrome and childhood autism. Children with ASD can display challenging behaviour, which can sometimes appear physically aggressive. The condition can also include behaviours like pica (putting inedible things in the mouth) and repetitive hand flapping, tapping or twisting. The world can be a confusing, isolating and daunting place for a child with autism and it is their difficulties with communication and social interaction that are often the root cause of difficult behaviour. The child's behaviour is not caused by bad parenting, the National Autistic Society says. Because of these difficulties, children can find it hard to communicate their needs or to understand what other people are saying to them, or asking them to do. Children with an ASD may not understand 'social rules' - the unwritten rules that govern social situations, such as how loud or quiet they must be, what behaviour is appropriate in public places, how close to stand to other people or how to take a turn in conversation. This is especially true if children find themselves in a new, unfamiliar situation. Therefore, social situations or new situations can be daunting and unpredictable. This can cause considerable frustration and anxiety which, if it can't be expressed any other way may result in challenging behaviour.

Steve Wright's weekly BBC 2 programme has been ruled to have breached the corporation's guidelines . It is the gentle Sunday morning radio show that encourages its listeners to phone in with heartfelt dedications for their loved ones. But fans of Steve Wright’s weekly BBC 2 programme were surprised to discover their romantic messages were not getting through…because it was pre-recorded. Sunday Love Songs has been ruled to have breached the corporation’s guidelines by failing to explain music requests made during the show would not be broadcast the same day. The audience was told to phone in ‘any time’ with romantic song choices and messages, without an explanation the show’s script was finalised three days earlier. It meant some listeners wasted time and money on calls when their requests had already missed the cut off point. They also spent time listening for their messages when there was no chance they would be included on the show, broadcast between 9am and 11am every Sunday. The BBC Trust’s editorial standards committee said the failure to inform listeners properly breached guidelines on accuracy and interacting with the audience. It upheld a complaint by a listener who only discovered the show was not live when it was announced a reference to entertainer Andy Williams had been recorded before his death. The show is recorded on Fridays, but the playlist and script are decided each Thursday, meaning requests made after that point could not be considered for the next show. An answerphone message to callers only made this clear after they had already left a request. The BBC amended the on-air and phone messages to make it clear dedications would be considered for future programmes rather than the one being broadcast at the time of the call. The BBC Trust has upheld a listener complaint ruling the show breached Corporation guidelines . But the committee ruled the updated message still breached accuracy guidelines because it was not made clear requests would have to be made before the Thursday deadline to be included in the Sunday show. The committee found the fact the show was presented ‘as live’ despite being pre-recorded was not a breach of editorial guidelines. It added the BBC did not intentionally mislead its audience, saying: ‘the problem was essentially one of clarity.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘In light of the Trust’s findings on clarity for people leaving dedications for the programme, we have revised the wording in order to ensure the process is absolutely clear for listeners.’ Steve Wright is best known for presenting Radio 1’s Steve Wright in the Afternoon The veteran DJ, 58, moved to Radio 2 in 1996.",Sunday Love Songs ruled to have breached corporation's guidelines.

It plans to show Valve's Dota 2 international competition as well as global tournaments for Counter Strike.
But one expert wondered where the audience for the channel would was going to come from.
In a statement, Ginx boss Michiel Bakker said the channel aimed to give esports ""significant mainstream TV exposure"" that would complement the online streaming of gaming that many watch.
He said he hoped that making the channel available to Sky's millions of customers would help people discover esports for the first time. It would also give established fans a different perspective on competitions and tournaments, he added.
The channel will face significant competition for its audience as many gamers prefer to watch gaming streams online. Many follow regular gamers on the Twitch streaming service, on YouTube and Facebook or via sites run by game makers to broadcast top tournaments.
Earlier this year, Activision Blizzard bought the Major League Gaming firm as the start of a plan to make competitive gaming more accessible.
Increasing numbers of established broadcasters are also starting to put gaming tournaments on mainstream channel. Last year, the BBC aired the highlights of the quarter finals of Riot Games' League of Legends world championships. And, in the US, the sports network ESPN has also started to focus more on pro-gamers.
A report published earlier in 2016 by Deloitte predicted that global revenues from esports will rise by 25% this year to $500m (Â£353m). Its regular audience will likely top 150 million people globally, it predicted.
Alec Meer from gaming news site Rock, Paper Shotgun wondered who would be watching the tournaments and gaming-themed shows.
""It is difficult to imagine what the channel could possibly do to entice people away from watch-anywhere esports with favoured commentators and streams on YouTube and Twitch and back to broadcast TV,"" he said.
Many young people had simply ""abandoned"" TV in favour of web video, he added.
""Perhaps it's in with a chance if it can bag exclusive rights, as with football, but even if it does there's so much other esports out there that there's simply no way of cornering the market,"" Mr Meer told the BBC.
""Good luck to 'em,"" he said. ""It's nice to see more gaming on TV for sure, but I rather suspect it's far too late at this stage.""",A new esports channel is to be launched in the UK next year.
65279,"Games studio Blizzard Entertainment no longer operates servers for the original WoW, which was first released in 2004, so some fans run their own.
On 10 April, a popular fan server known as Nostalrius, with 150,000 active members, was closed after the threat of legal action by Blizzard Entertainment.
Blizzard has not responded to the BBC.
World of Warcraft is an online multi-player game in which players explore a vast landscape, complete quests and interact with other gamers.
The original game from 2004 has since been updated with new instalments that some players say have materially changed the experience of the game, so some fans have set up their own servers to play the original, ""vanilla"" WoW.
Blizzard has previously said it had no plans to reopen access to the ""classic"" game.
""We realise that some of you feel that World of Warcraft was more fun in the past than it is today, and we also know that some of you would like nothing more than to go back and play the game as it was back then,"" wrote a Blizzard community manager in 2011.
""The developers however prefer to see the game continuously evolve and progress, and as such we have no plans to open classic realms or limited expansion content realms.""
The decision to close fan-run server Nostalrius, which had attracted 800,000 players during its year online, has prompted anger from parts of the online gaming community.
Many who commented on the closure acknowledged the fact that running servers such as Nostalrius was technically illegal but said Blizzard should support non-profit fan-driven projects to keep the game going.
""World of Warcraft meant a lot, to a lot of people,"" said YouTube gamer Jon Jafari in a widely-shared video.
""It might seem silly because it's just a game... but this game was a big part of my life and a lot of people's lives. All these people want to do is go back and play it.
""If the server is making a profit, I can see them taking down something like that - but a lot of these are just for the love of the old game.""
Commenting on its closure, the team behind Nostalrius posted: ""We never saw our community as a threat for Blizzard. It sounds more like a transverse place where players can continue to enjoy old World of Warcraft's games no longer available.""",A World of Warcraft fan-run server has been shut after a year of controversy.

A banana tycoon repeatedly refused to call 911 after a woman he gave cocaine to began overdosing in the middle of a wild sex party at a luxurious New York hotel, a cop testified yesterday. Kimberley Calo, 41, collapsed and began 'frothing at the mouth' after consuming the high-quality cocaine during the three-way romp with Thomas Hoey Jr and his then-mistress Nicole Zobkiw at a plush $700-a-night suite at The Kitano hotel on Park Avenue. Hoey allegedly wasn't alarmed by Calo's condition and said 'he’d seen this before' and that she 'was going to be fine.' Victim: Calo, 41, collapsed and died after taking high-quality cocaine at a three-way sex party with Thomas Hoey and his former mistress Nicole Zobkiw . The banana mogul had sex with Zobkiw and then set his attention towards Calo, a personal trainer, said retired NYPD detective Edward Boyle, who investigated Calo's 2009 death. Hoey , pictured, refused pleas to call 911 even as her lips turned blue . Calo had first snorted the coke laying on a coffee table and when she went back for more, she began overdosing and 'her head dropped to the table with a thud,' Boyle told jurors at Manhattan federal court, where Zobkiw is on trial for making false statements and perjury. Zobkiw, 29, is accused of lying to a grand jury about the fatal party. Mr Hoey has not been charged. Boyle, who investigated the death, told the court that Mr Hoey had sex with both women and offered Calo cocaine using his business card, according to the New York Post. The Post quoted Boyle as saying that Calo began convulsing before 'her head dropped to the table with a thud. 'She was frothing at the mouth. Her eyes rolled back in her head. Her lips started turning blue,' he added. The court was told Zobkiw . attempted to get Hoey to call the emergency services but he refused, . allegedly telling her that Calo would be fine. She is seen in a security video going to the hotel reception three times to try and get help, Boyle said. Boyle told the court that Hoey assured Zobkiw that a 'doctor friend' was on the way. Zobkiw's lawyer Leonard Lato admitted his client had to tried to hide what happened on the night. But . she was intimidated two days before her grand jury testimony in 2011 by . a 'corrupt lawyer' allegedly linked to Hoey, Lato said. Scene: The wild sex party took place at a $700-a-night suite at The Kitano hotel on Park Avenue in Manhattan. Zobkiw ran to the reception desk three times as she tried to get help for Calo . Zobkiw was told she would not get custody of her son if she did not lie, Lato explained. The conversation was secretly recorded by her boyfriend, according to Lato, who told members of the jury 'your eyes are going to pop out of your head' when it is played. During opening statements, Manhattan federal prosecutor Margarat Garnett said Zobkiw told a 'string of lies' about the evening. She is accused of impeding an investigation into Calo's death by denying either woman had sex with Hoey or took cocaine. Federal agents launched an investigation into Hoey last year but no charges were brought. The company was founded in 1991 and employs between ten and 20 employees. According to Cortera business director, Long Island Banana has annual sales figures of under $500,000.

19002,"Navy Secretary Ray Mabus sent the letters to the admirals which are considered to be career-ending reprimands leaving all three seeking retirement . Three more Navy admirals have been reprimanded in connection with the Fat Leonard bribery scandal after they accepted expensive gifts in exchange for Navy secrets but none will face criminal charges, the Navy said. The widening 'Fat Leonard' scandal  has seen senior sailors implicated in a long-running bribery scheme that included rewards of prostitutes, Lady Gaga tickets and payoffs in Southeast Asia. So far, the massive bribery scandal has cost the government $20 million and the admirals censured represent the highest-ranking officers to be punished in the case so far. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus sent censure letters to Michael Miller, Terry Kraft and David Pimpo, and they are considered to be career-ending reprimands leaving all three seeking retirement. The reprimands could even affect their ability to claim benefits after they displayed  such 'poor judgment and a failure of leadership in prior tours,' Mabus said. According to Navy officials, the entire case stems from an ongoing federal probe into bribery and fraud involving Navy contracts for port services in southeast Asia. Leonard Glenn Francis, a Malaysian contractor known as 'Fat Leonard' because of his size, pleaded guilty in federal court in San Diego to buying off U.S. military officials. The  contractor at the center of the scandal pleaded guilty to fraud charges last month, admitting to bribing officials with cash, Lady Gaga tickets, prostitutes, Cuban cigars and Kobe beef. Reprimands: Rear Admiral Terry Kraft, left, is commander of US naval forces in Japan and Rear Admiral David Pimpo, right is commander of Naval Supply Systems Command they both face censures . Censure: Rear Admiral Michael Miller is currently a special assistant to the superintendent of the US Naval Academy and faces censure . He confirmed that he presided over a decade-long scheme involving tens of millions of dollars in bribes, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said Francis, CEO of Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia, obtained classified information that allowed the firm to overbill the military at least $20 million. He charged them for port services such as food, fuel and garbage disposal. All of the admirals improperly accepted gifts, two 'improperly endorsed a commercial business,' and one solicited gifts and services when they were stationed in the Pacific region in 2006-2007. And all of the officers reprimanded were in high-ranking positions. Rear Admiral Michael Miller is currently a special assistant to the superintendent of the US Naval Academy.

The corruption scandal has shaken the American navy, with several officers pleading guilty and another arrested this month in the case . Several Navy officers and officials, including a captain and a retired lieutenant commander have also have pleaded guilty to federal charges, while others await trial. Francis has acknowledged bribing officials with more than $500,000 in cash and luxury goods worth millions. The goods included spa treatments, top-shelf alcohol, designer handbags, furniture, watches, ornamental swords and handmade ship models, according to court documents. In exchange, Navy officers re-routed ships to ports owned by Francis and helped him boost his business. He now awaits sentencing. Meanwhile, another former high-ranking civilian contracting officer for the Navy was arrested last week on a conspiracy charge. He faces allegations that he accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars along with travel and the services of prostitutes for getting Navy contracts for GDMA.

""We know that. But payment of damages by wrongdoers is the only means we have in this country to make things right."" Two employees of rig owner Transocean, meanwhile, accused the company of putting profits above lives and cutting back on safety and employees leading up to the explosion. When workers complained of needing more help, ""They just kept telling us they'd see what they could do,"" said engineer Doug Brown, 50, of Vancouver, Washington. Brown suffered head and leg injuries in the explosion and said he now struggles with short-term memory loss and post-traumatic stress disorder. Employee Stephen Stone told committee members that the explosion ""was hardly the first thing to go wrong"" on the rig. Both men described a horrific scene on board the Deepwater Horizon the night of April 20, with people crying and screaming for help as others scrambled for safety. ""I was pretty certain I was going to die,"" Stone said.

70065,"Colorado emerged as the state with the second-highest percentage of regular marijuana users as it began legalizing the drug, according to a new national study. The Denver Post  reports the study by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found about one out of every eight Colorado residents older than 12 had used marijuana in the past month. Only Rhode Island topped Colorado in the percentage of residents who reported using pot as often, according to the study. The study averaged state-specific data over two-year periods. It found that, for the 2011-2012 period, 10.4 percent of Colorado residents 12 and older said they had used pot in the month before being surveyed. That number jumped to 12.7 percent in the 2012-2013 data. That means about 530,000 people in Colorado use marijuana at least once a month, according to the results. Scroll down for video . The study by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found about one out of every eight Colorado residents older than 12 had used marijuana in the past month (file picture) Nationally, about 7.4 percent of people 12 and older reported monthly marijuana use. That's an increase of about 4 percent. In Washington state, which also legalized marijuana use and limited possession for adults, monthly pot use rose about 20 percent to 12.3 percent of people 12 and older. The survey is among the first to quantify pot use in Colorado since late 2012, when voters approved legal pot use and possession for those over 21. But the survey did not analyze data from 2014, when recreational marijuana shops opened, which means it is not a good indication of the effect of commercial sales on marijuana use. ""I don't think this tells us about the long-term impacts of legalization,"" said University of California, Los Angeles, professor Mark Kleiman, who studies marijuana policy. The number of medical marijuana patients in Colorado rose over the same time period, so the results are not surprising, Kleiman said. He told The Post that researchers will have a better idea about pot use in the first state to legalize recreational sales of the drug once they can focus on data showing how many people use pot daily. ""The fraction of people who are monthly users who are in fact daily users has gone way, way up,"" he said. Nationally, about 7.4 percent of people 12 and older reported monthly marijuana use.

65469,"By . Sam Creighton . Timothy Millender continued working for the clinic despite being a convicted paedophile . A paedophile was allowed to run a clinic offering treatments to young children for two months after a court found him guilty of his sickening crimes. Timothy Millender, 32, continued to work at Redwood Health Therapies, in Winchester, Hampshire, which offered hypnotherapy to youngsters under 16, despite being given a six month suspended sentence for hoarding vile images of babies being raped and tortured. Millender pleaded guilty at Basingstoke Magistrates' Court to having 740 pictures and 106 videos of children as young as six months being abused. Some of the films were level five, the most extreme level possible. On top of his suspended sentence, he was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register but still went back to work at the clinic. Millender was listed as a director of the company which, according to the Sunday Mirror, was hastily shut down last week. However, the website is still live and claims the hypnotherapy sessions 'help children to free themselves of their bottled up emotions' by using the 'Blowaway Technique' - a popular form of therapy where children are hypnotised into a physically relaxed state and then told to literally 'blow away' any bad feelings or problems they may have. A former employee told the Sunday Mirror: 'It's shocking a convicted paedophile could carry on running a business advertising services for children. 'The images he was looking at were of the very worst kind yet he walked free from court and was able to carry on running the clinic for two months after he pleaded guilty. It's disgusting.'

82151,"The LDP, which enjoyed almost 50 years of unbroken rule until 2009, is projected to have an overall majority in the new parliament.
Mr Abe has already served a Japan's Prime Minister between 2006 and 2007.
He campaigned on a pledge to end 20 years of economic stagnation and to direct a more assertive foreign policy at a time of tensions with China.
He is seen as a hawkish, right-of-centre leader whose previous term in office ended ignominiously amid falling popularity and a resignation on grounds of ill health.
But Japanese media project big gains for his LDP who they say are on course to win between 275 to 310 seats in the 480-member house.
Its ally, the small New Komeito party, looks set to win about 30 seats to possibly give the alliance a two-thirds majority in the lower house.
That would give Mr Abe the power to over-rule parliament's upper house and help to break a deadlock that some say has plagued the world's third biggest economy since 2007.
The BBC's Rupert Wingfield Hayes says as many predicted, Japan has taken a sharp turn to the right.
The big losers from the election were the outgoing prime minister Yoshihiko Noda and his Democratic Party (DPJ) which is  forecast to win between 55 and 77 seats.
A party spokesman told Japan's NHK television Mr Noda would have to resign over the defeat, in which some of the party's leading figures are projected to have lost their seats.
The DPJ has struggled since coming to power in 2009. Two prime ministers came and went before Mr Noda as the party struggled to deliver amid the economic downturn and 11 March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
Mr Noda lost over his move to double sales tax, something he said was necessary to tackle Japan's massive debt.
By contrast, Mr Abe has promised more public spending, looser monetary policy, and to allow nuclear energy a role to play in resource-poor Japan's future despite last year's nuclear disaster at Fukushima.
Q&A: China-Japan islands row
But economists say there is little new in Mr Abe's policies, or 'Abenomics' as they have been called. They have been adopted by previous LDP governments without successfully renewing the Japanese economy.
Mr Abe has also called for a tough stance on a territorial row with China over islands in the East China Sea that both countries claim.
But neither of the main parties fully convinced voters.  Several new parties contested the poll and the right-leaning Japan Restoration Party founded by the mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto. could win as many as 50 seats.
And the nationalist former governor of Tokyo governor, Shintaro  Ishihara, whose bid to buy disputed islands provoked a fierce diplomatic  showdown with China, may also have won a seat in parliament according to Japanese media.",Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been defeated by his left-wing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a general election.

The 77-year-old Emmy - and Grammy-winning actor and comedian, who has been married for 50 years and has five children, has been battling accusations of sex assault for more than three decades. According to published reports, between the 1970s and early 2000s, as many as 13 women have come forward accusing Cosby of sexual assault.

Cosby, best known for portraying the sweater-wearing, wise-cracking Dr Heathcliff Huxtable on the long-running Cosby Show, has become a polarizing figure in recent years for urging young black men to change their way of dress in order to be more successful in life. Cosby also has been critical of some of his fellow comedians, most famously Eddie Murphy, for using foul language in their routines. Hannibal Buress, a regular on Comedy Central’s Broad Street, appeared last year in the R-rated comedy Neighbors starring Zac Ephron and Seth Rogen. Earlier this month, he was cast as a voice actor in the upcoming animated feature Angry Birds based on the popular game. In August, it was revealed by Deadline that Bill Cosby was on the verge of signing a deal with NBC to develop a new family comedy starring the 77-year-old actor in a familiar role of a patriarch of a multi-generational clan. Not mincing words: Buress, a former SNL writer, described Cosby as a hypocrite for urging young black men to 'pull up their pants' and for criticizing fellow comedians for using foul language on stage . If all goes according to plan, the show will premiere sometime in the summer or fall of 2015. As of Tuesday evening, Dr Cosby has not responded to Hannibal Buress' rant accusing him of being a rapist.

On Monday afternoon, 33-year-old Lakeisha Brooks was in the check-out line of a Rouses grocery store in Houma, Louisiana, waiting to pay for some milk and cereal when the unthinkable happened: a bright flash, a loud crash - Brooks had been struck by lightning while standing inside a grocery store. 'I felt like a breeze and then the pain came,' she tells HoumaToday.com. The blast had blown Brooks' shoe clean off her foot. Shocked, she hopped away to the other side of the store. When she looked back, she saw it strike the floor again in the exact same spot where she had just been struck. Rare: a National Weather Service meteorologist says he's never heard of anyone getting struck by lightning in doors . 'A man there kept saying, ""you never see lightning strike the same place twice."" Well, it did,' she says. Brooks described the bizarre strike as feeling like hot oil running down her thigh, 'like when you're cooking, that pop,' she says. Gavin Phillips, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, says he can't remember a time when a person has been struck by lightning while INSIDE a building. But local authorities believe  the lightning traveled through the store's sprinkler system before it struck a metal plate on . the floor, and ultimately striking Brooks. Lakeisha Brooks was struck by lightning while shopping INSIDE of this Rouses grocery store . Brooks, a 33-year-old mother of four who works in the cafeteria at a local junior high school, suffered burns to her left leg and right foot. She was taken to Terrebonne General Medical Center, where she was treated and released. Brooks says she's lucky to be alive. 'First thing I said when I sat down was God is good,' she says. Brooks says she usually stays in doors during thunderstorms, but now thinks even that might not be enough. 'Just knowing it could happen inside a grocery store,' she says, 'it could happen anywhere.'","Lakeisha Brooks, 33, suffered burns to her left leg and right foot after being struck by lightning in Houma, Louisiana.

48244,"Petra Kvitova made a convincing start to her bid for back-to-back grand slams with the loss of just one game in seeing off Kristina Mladenovic of France Tuesday at Flushing Meadows. The Wimbledon champion has come into the U.S. Open after a morale boosting victory in the preceding New Haven tournament and again looked impressive. The third-seeded Czech broke her 73rd-ranked opponent five times in a one-sided contest to earn a second round clash with compatriot Petra Cetkovska. But there was a upset defeat for Australian Open finalist Dominika Cibulkova, who was stunned by 15-year-old American Catherine Bellis 6-1 4-6 6-4. Bellis becomes the youngest winner at the U.S. Open since Anna Kournikova in 1996 as she beat the 12th seed, who has endured a miserable summer on the hard courts. Other seeds fared better led by by seventh ranked Eugenie Bouchard of Canada, beaten by Kvitova in the Wimbledon final. Bouchard has struggled since her heroics at SW19, but eased past Olga Govortsova of Belarus on the Louis Armstrong court with a 6-2 6-1 victory. Govortsov had three break points at 2-2 in the first set but could not convert and won just a single game thereafter. Bouchard hit 19 winners overall and few unforced errors to get another grand slam campaign rolling. ""I'm happy to get a match under my belt and want to keep it rolling this week,"" said Bouchard.

4145,"Yes, we're talking about Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola.
The pair are coming to Manchester to take charge at two of the world's most famous clubs next season.
Pep was announced as Man City manager in February, while Jose is to take the top job at Manchester United after Louis van Gaal's sacking.
Let's look at why footy fans can't wait for the summer.
Who's Jose? Portuguese, former Chelsea boss who has won the Premier League three times with the London club.
Who's Pep? Spanish, current Bayern Munich manager, has spent most of his career as a player, and then manager, at Barcelona.
Both men are famed for being fiercely competitive, as well as super stylish.
Jose's known for his passion and entertaining humour - calling himself the ""Special One"".
Pep, on the other hand, is known for being cool, calm and collected.
The pair first met at Barcelona more than 20 years ago - when Guardiola was a player and Mourinho worked there.
They later became coaching arch rivals in Spain's La Liga - Pep managed Barca between 2008 and 2012, whilst Jose was the top boss at Real Madrid between 2010 and 2013.
Both of their trophy cabinets are pretty full...
Guardiola has won six league titles - three times with Barca in Spain and three times with Bayern Munich in Germany.
Mourinho has gone one better. He has seven league titles to his name - with Chelsea, Real Madrid, Inter Milan and Porto.
When it comes to the Champions League, they've both won twice.
Guardiola won with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011. But he missed out in 2010 because of Mourinho, when his side Inter Milan beat Barca in the semi-finals. Ouch.
Mourinho also won the Champions League back in 2004 with underdogs Porto, who actually beat Man United in the quarter-finals.
""Whatever team he goes to he will be successful. For me, it's almost a certainty.""
Former Barca player Eidur Gudjohnsen on Pep

35300,"At the height of the Cold War, former Labour cabinet minister Tony Benn was considered by the Soviet Union an 'unnecessary simpleton' who was too stupid to recruit as an agent,  a KGB defector has claimed. Oleg Gordievsky, who was tasked with spying for the KGB while posted in London as a resident designate in the 1980s, warned his colleagues that if elected deputy-leader of the Labour party, Benn would ruin the Cold War political balance. Although tasked with running a Soviet intelligence operation from London, Mr Gordievsky had in fact worked for MI6 since 1974. Scroll down for video . Soviet defector Oleg Gordievsky (pictured) claims the Russians considered Benn too 'simple' to recruit . This led to him being named a Companion of the Most Distinguished Order in the 2007 Queen's Birthday Honours for his assistance to British national security. But in an interview with The Telegraph, Mr Gordievsky has now claimed Benn was ignored by Soviet diplomats as a potential source because he was unreliable and made false claims. During a 1983 meeting with Soviet ambassador Viktor Popov, Mr Gordievsky was told to be aware of Benn who was considered 'not truthful'. Mr Gordievsky said: 'He was an unnecessary simpleton, who told left-wing fairytales and falsified stories.' He added that two years earlier he had prevented Soviet intelligence officials from supporting Benn in the Labour leadership contest and sent memos to Moscow warning it would be 'catastrophic' for Europe's political balance if Benn was elected. Tony Benn (right) poses for a photo with Soviet Union leader Alexei Kosygin, during the Russian leader's 1967 visit to Britain . Benn's guest appearance at the 1984 Militant Tendency rally (pictured) was considered a blunder that severely damaged his chances of a place on the shadow cabinet . Benn died in March at the age of 88. He was described as the 'most dangerous man in Britain' in the 1980s, but was voted the UK's 'political hero' by viewers of the BBC's Daily Politics programme in 2007. He joined the Labour Party in 1943, and became an MP seven years later, winning the Bristol South-East by-election after the death of Sir Stafford Cripps in 1950. Fairly moderate at the start, Benn's political views became more extreme to the left as his career progressed, until, by the time he retired in 2001 'to devote more time to politics', he was one of the most radical politicians in his party. He put forward the Commonwealth of Britain Bill to abolish the monarchy in 1992. In later life, Benn was appointed President of Stop the War Coalition and campaigned vigorously against the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Tony Benn gives a public speech during his 1984 campaign for the Labour candidacy of Chesterfield .","Oleg Gordievsky was tasked with spying for the KGB in the 1980s.

98775,"At an open event in Gorseinon, Gower, Carwyn Jones promised a ""fresh and exciting"" manifesto for 2016 to answer claims the party had run out of ideas.
Labour lost Gower to the Tories at the general election in May after holding the seat for more than 100 years.
Some activists told Mr Jones the party was not listening to its grassroots.
The warning came on Friday as Welsh Labour held the first in a series of question-and-answer sessions open to the general public and party members.
""We want a fresh and exciting manifesto,"" Mr Jones said.
""To get to that point, you go through a testing process, sometimes an uncomfortable process in order to get there.
""That's how you end up with a good offer to people.""
But Gareth Phillips, a Labour councillor from Bridgend, said party officials in Cardiff failed to heed warnings that Gower was under threat, preferring to focus campaign efforts on attempts to capture the Vale of Glamorgan from the Conservatives.
""You are not listening to grassroots activists,"" he told Mr Jones.
""Consultations are great, but they're only great if people are listened to.  I don't think [Welsh Labour HQ] Transport House are listening - that's your starting point.""
Mr Jones said later: ""There is a need to change the party structure, that's true, but I don't think it causes us to lose elections.""
The first minister was joined in Gorseinon by Deputy Culture Minister Ken Skates, who has been given the job of preparing the manifesto.
Ministers have defended a separate Welsh government ""Carwyn Connect"" tour against Tory claims that taxpayers are funding Labour's re-election campaign.
""Our antenna broke,"" a Welsh Labour spin doctor says, reflecting on the general election.
In other words, Labour lost contact with the people and places who have traditionally kept its campaigns on track.
The outcome was that Labour not only failed to take ground from the Tories, it lost ground.
Take Gower, for example. A Labour campaigner there told me he went to the count on election night expecting to retain the constituency by about 1,000 votes.
Instead, the Conservatives won the seat - a seat Labour had held for more than 100 years - by just 27 votes.
The result surprised Labour.  So, no surprises that Carwyn Jones and Ken Skates, the deputy minister writing Welsh Labour's 2016 manifesto, were in Gower today to hear what people have to say.
They're on the road to meet the public - not just Labour members - and make sure Labour's offer in 2016 matches voters' concerns.
It's a genuine listening exercise, we're told.
But we've heard that before. Didn't Ed Miliband say his party would hold millions of conversations with voters earlier this year?
And I remember the same spin doctor - he of the broken antenna - telling me in the run up to the 2011 assembly election that Labour really was consulting widely to deliver a fresh manifesto.
Will things be different this time?
The intention isn't just to learn lessons from the general election, but to convince the world that Labour wants to learn those lessons, even if it means locking horns with voters who think the Welsh government has made a hash of running public services.
There's no doubt the party's antenna needs repairing.  Until it's working again, Labour can't be sure it's hit the bottom: it can't be sure the general election was as bad as it gets, or whether there's worse to come.","A Welsh Labour deputy minister has said he is ""not listening to grassroots activists"" after the party's attempt to capture a Welsh constituency from the Tories."

More than 4,000 people from across the country have signed a protest petition.
The Pearson group which provides the Edexcel exams said its papers ""accurately reflect the curriculum"".
Alexandra Elkins said: ""I turned over the first paper and I looked at what was written and I thought, 'this can't be right, this isn't the right paper'.""
Annabel Smith said: ""I flicked through the rest of the paper after reading the first question thinking, 'okay maybe this is just one question and the rest of it will get onto the stuff that we know',"" she said.
However, she added all the questions were ""off-topic"".
They say the paper was a repeat of a previous paper for AS Level students two years ago, covering topics which they were not taught.
Those who have signed the online petition have also labelled the paper as ""ridiculous"" and ""unacceptable"".
The 17-year-olds were predicted top grade A-Levels in biology in order to secure a place at university, and reach goals of becoming a dentist and a vet.
A Pearson spokesman said: ""Our exam papers accurately reflect the curriculum that schools, teachers and learners have been working towards.
""In the case of the unit 4 Biology paper the specification is clear that some content may draw on AS material.""
Queen Mary's College said it had contacted both the exams board and the exams standard body Ofqual to raise concerns.",Two 17-year-olds have protested against a revision of their A-Level Biology exam.
50533,"Europe is estimated to have 10-12 million Roma, many of them concentrated in eastern, former communist countries.
Back in 2005 the Decade of Roma Inclusion was launched - a global initiative by the EU, UN and World Bank to improve housing, jobs, health and education for the Roma.
The BBC's Delia Radu visited Roma in Romania and Slovakia to find out what, if anything, was achieved by that initiative.
The top picture shows Constantin Moldovan and his children on the outskirts of Ocna Sibiului, a town in Romania's central Transylvania region.
Desperately poor, they often skip meals and the family of 11 squeezes into a two-room, crumbling house.
The community lives under steep slopes prone to landslides - so locals call them ""People of the Ravines"".
""Of course we're scared whenever the earth comes down,"" said Mr Moldovan, as a hissing noise accompanied a minor shower of sand and clay.
""But what can we do? The local authorities aren't interested in giving us any help,"" he complained.
Across the road lives Petruta Paraschiva Otvos. When I visited 10 years ago she told me how she had been buried alive in a landslide in her backyard, then dug out by her neighbours and taken to hospital.
Since then she has done menial jobs in Spain, together with her four children, and they managed to build this new home, with four rooms for four families.
She is proud to have a two-storey house, but told me they often skipped meals, too, to save money. She often borrows money from neighbours to buy bread and medicines for her disabled husband, who lost a leg many years ago and has only a meagre pension.
The poorest of the poor in Ocna Sibiului carve out a hole in the hillside and call it home: social housing from Mother Nature.
A Roma woman in her 40s lives in this cave dwelling. She works as a cleaner.
The local authorities say anyone who lives in a cave dwelling isn't a native of the town. They say the poor Roma get a lot of aid but waste it.
When I asked about the landslide danger, the authorities said they had provided plots of safer land elsewhere in the town.
But that begs a question: if the poorest Roma cannot afford decent food and clothing, how can they afford to build a new house from scratch?
The cave dwellings are not new: they were featured in a 1936 magazine article entitled ""The poorest people in Romania"".
The plight of the ""troglodytes"" back then was recorded by The Illustrated Reality.
Roma have had settled communities in Europe for centuries, but are often treated as outsiders. Their roots go back to India - their nomadic ancestors brought with them a language related to Sanskrit.
Some of Transylvania's Roma have prospered.
Ilie and Rodica Ciociu and their grandson live in Apoldu de Sus. They are among the minority of Roma who have stable jobs.
Ilie runs his own small business, having finished a business course. Ten years ago he was in the wool trade, constantly fearing that the police would seize his merchandise. But now he is in the Roma Party and a local councillor.
Rodica handles Roma health issues. But in the summer she picks strawberries in Germany, like some other Roma in the village who get seasonal work on German farms. That earns them enough to improve their homes - and sometimes they can live off their earnings for months.
Many other Roma in Apoldu de Sus live in ramshackle mud houses. Ilie Pasu's mud house collapsed and now he lives in a shipping container, to which he added a flimsy roof.
A report on the Decade of Roma Inclusion acknowledged that poor housing remained a persistent problem in Roma communities.
Ilie Pasu shares this cramped container with five children and his pregnant wife. He is looking for work.
In a 2013 survey by the EU's Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), 27% of Roma men complained of discrimination when looking for work, based on their ethnicity.
Ten years ago when I visited Apoldu de Sus I met Roma who said Romanian employers avoided them because of their Roma identity.
The bleak district of Ferentari is not far from the centre of Romania's capital Bucharest.
About half of Ferentari's residents are Roma. Most people call this street ""the ghetto"", though its real name is ""Orchards Alley"". It is the most deprived and arguably the most dangerous street in Bucharest.
The locals live in overcrowded flats, mostly in one room without any central heating or gas. The area is rife with drugs and in the park nearby there is a bin for needles. Rubbish uncollected for weeks litters the streets.
In Slovakia more than 5,000 Roma live crammed into a shanty town in Jarovnice, separated from their Slovak neighbours.
It is the largest Roma settlement in Slovakia, where Roma complain that ghettoisation is particularly deep-rooted.
Sometimes walls keep Roma out of ethnic Slovak neighbourhoods.
In Jarovnice's case, the dividing line is a polluted creek.
According to the UN children's agency Unicef, in Eastern Europe only 20% of Roma children are enrolled in primary school.
In 2005, many Roma children in Jarovnice skipped school, especially during the winter. The reason was very simple: they had no shoes.
A decade on, extreme poverty still keeps many Roma children away from school. Those who do attend do not mix with their Slovak peers. Most Slovak parents bus their children to a school outside the village.
That segregation prompted the EU to launch a discrimination case against Slovakia.
A rare success story in the The Decade of Roma Inclusion was the creation of a fund providing grants for Roma children. As a result, the number of Roma children who finish secondary school is growing.

67841,"North was knocked out as Saints beat Wasps 52-30, the fourth time he has taken a blow to the head this season.
Northampton say the 22-year-old is being assessed and the club ""will not be making any further statement yet"".
Former Ireland international O'Driscoll said: ""There should be no more rugby for George North this rugby year.""
North was left motionless when he was struck on the head by Wasps forward Nathan Hughes's knee after scoring his second try for the Saints.
Hughes, who protested his innocence, was sent off for dangerous play.
Former Scarlets wing North also suffered blows to his head in the autumn and again during the Six Nations.
He missed Wales' 12-6 win over South Africa in November after being concussed against New Zealand, and was then struck twice on the head while playing against England during the Six Nations.
North missed Wales' next match against Scotland after being given an ""extended recovery period"".
O'Driscoll is an outspoken critic of the way rugby's governing body manages head injuries, and resigned from his post on its medical committee in 2012 in protest at the decision to trial a new protocol for dealing with concussion.
He believes North should take a break from the game, while having regular psychological, cognitive and physical assessments.
""Somebody who has four concussions in five months - two in one game - and is going back to such a brutal game as rugby should be having a long rest from rugby under the care of a neurologist,"" O'Driscoll told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
Northampton issued a statement on Saturday saying North would be assessed by a specialist this week and that the club ""places the highest importance on player welfare"".

16258,"The indoor terrain, about the size of a basketball court, will be used to test systems on the rover that Europe will send to the Red Planet in 2018.
ExoMars, as it is known, will be a six-wheeled robot tasked with finding signs of past or present life.
The UK division of Airbus Defence and Space will assemble the rover from parts built across member states of the European Space Agency (Esa).
But it has the specific role also of developing the vehicle's autonomous navigation system.
The great distance between Earth and Mars means the robot cannot be controlled in real time; commands take tens of minutes to cross the space between the planets.
Instead, ExoMars will be given a destination to reach, and its onboard cameras and computer will then work out the most appropriate route, avoiding large boulders and potential fissures in the ground.
The new ""Mars yard"" is being used to develop the necessary algorithms.
""We need to verify the performance, to check that the algorithms and the processes that we're using will actually work - will be fit for purpose to deal with the conditions and obstacles we expect to find on Mars,"" said Dr Ralph Cordey from Airbus.
The sand pit will play a critical role also in testing the rover's drive systems.
Like previous vehicles sent to the Red Planet, ExoMars will be based on a free-moving, rocker-bogie suspension that allows it to climb over small rocks.
This equipment will be provided by robotics experts at MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates in Canada (Canada is a co-operating member state of Esa).
Various prototypes already at Stevenage have been trying out the new ""Marscape"".
The lessons learned will be built into the eventual ""flight"" model - the actual vehicle that is sent to Mars.
This itself will never see the Mars yard. It will be assembled in a new ""cleanroom"" at the Airbus factory to ensure it is kept spotless, and free from any Earthly contamination that could confuse its instruments when they go hunting ""biosignatures"" on Mars.
Once Airbus has assembled the flight model, it will be sent to Thales Alenia Space in Turin, Italy, where its payload of scientific instruments will be added.
The key UK science contribution is the PanCam imaging system developed by a team under the leadership of Prof Andrew Coates at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory.
The current US rover, Curiosity, has wowed us with its pictures from Gale Crater. ExoMars hopes to do the same.
""Curiosity can see a lot, but PanCam will be able to see a much larger region in its field of view,"" Prof Coates explained.
""It can also zoom in and view sections in great detail with our high-resolution camera. With that we'll be able to narrow down where to drill to search for signs of life.""
Precisely where on the Red Planet ExoMars will go has yet to be decided.
The project is holding its first landing-site selection meeting this week in Madrid, Spain, but it will be 2017 before a final choice is made.
Another outstanding matter is ExoMars' budget. Esa has capped the project at 1.2bn euros.  This sum covers both an atmospheric-research and telecommunications satellite as well as the rover itself.
Esa member states have yet to commit all of the money that will be needed, but the agency's science director, Alvaro Gimenez, said the gap - of roughly 165m euros - should be closed very soon.
""Yes, there is a gap.  It's less than 15%, but we need to close it, and the sooner the better, and we expect to do that before the end of the year,"" he predicted.
The Mars Yard was officially opened by Business Secretary Vince Cable. He said projects such as ExoMars fitted with the government's campaign to get more young people pursuing technical subjects at university.
""We are massively undersupplied in the UK with STEM graduates, and I think the excitement generated by space as an industry provides a lot of energy behind that campaign,"" he told reporters.

29682,"New country: Doug Leguin, 60, took over a Dallas neighborhood on Monday as he attempted to secede from the nation . A 60-year-old man terrorized an expensive Dallas neighborhood as he attempted to secede from the U.S. and start his own nation called 'Dougiestan'. It's still unclear what drew Doug Leguin, of Corinth, to the upscale neighborhood where he lured police with a fake 911 call reporting a fire. Leguin proceeded to shoot at responding officers, while a nanny and 8-year-old child holed up for protection in a nearby mansion. No one was injured in the incident, and Leguin was later apprehended and charged with seven counts of aggravated assault on a public servant. He remains held on $350,000 bail at the Dallas County Jail. The incident started to unfold Tuesday afternoon when Leguin's wife called police to report her husband missing. She said he hadn't gone to work and there was an AK-47, ammunition and several propane tanks missing from their garage. Police say Leguin first tried to enter a home on the 5500 block of North 40th Place, but the nanny who answered the door refused to let him in and went to find a safe place inside the home to hide with the 8-year-old girl in her care. Outside, Leguin called police himself to report a fire in the neighborhood where he had set several traps and propane tanks. He also flipped the home's American flag upside down. Attack: Leguin first tried to enter this mansion, but was refused by the nanny who answered the door. Instead, he camped out in a wooded area where he waited for officers to arrive . Shots fired: Leguin shot at seven responding officers while the nanny and the 8-year-old child she was looking after hid in the house . Once firefighters and police arrived, Leguin changed his story and told the dispatcher that he was seceding from the U.S. and forming his own country because he was frustrated with the current government. 'I'm Dougie Doug and I just seceded from the nation,' the caller said. 'I've seceded from the nation. This is now Dougiestan right here.' 'I'm pissed off at America. America is broke. It's got a sorry government, and the people won't vote,' he continued. He also said he was upset with the Dallas Police for 'shooting the mentally handicapped'. When asked if he had been diagnosed with anything, Leguin said 'a clear mind and a full heart'. He then threatened to shoot any police officer who came forward and even shot at a propane tank which exploded. Trap: Leguin set a fire to draw firefighters and police to the neighborhood . Explosion: The gunman blew up a propane tank, but no one was injured . Damage: A bullet hole is pictured on a vehicle from the shootout . Friends say Leguin works as a chandelier installer, which may explain why he chose the rich neighborhood on Monday. He was eventually arrested when police surrounded him in a wooded area adjacent to the house. They found Leguin in possession of 750 rounds of ammunition . According to friend Lee Bamburg, Leguin is a left-leaning libertarian who has struggled with health issues recently. 'He is not anti-government, he is not anti-American, and he wants you to start thinking and to stop letting other people think for you,' Bamburg told Fox Dallas/Forth Worth. 'I think he wants you to listen and go vote.' In custody: Leguin was later arrested after police surrounded him in a wooded area adjacent to the house . Victims: A still shows what appears to be the nanny and 8-year-old girl rescued in the incident . Bamburg says Leguin, a diabetic, had developed tremors in his hands recently which may have made his job stressful. He believes Leguin didn't intend to hurt anyone in the incident since he knows how to shoot a gun and would have shot someone if he wanted to. Bamburg says Leguin probably shot at the officers to 'prolong the situation'. Neighbors in Leguin's Corinth neighborhood were also shocked to hear the news. 'He is very grandparent-like,' neighbor Tosha Price told NBC. 'Passive, softspoken.'","Doug Leguin, 60, took over a Dallas neighborhood on Monday afternoon.

Although unemployment is down, the employment level has also fallen and there is a rise in economic inactivity.
This includes people who are not working or classed as unemployed, for example studying or caring for a family member.
The Welsh government said over the past year, Wales had ""outperformed almost every other part of the UK"", recording the joint largest fall in the unemployment rate and the second largest increase in the rate of employment.
Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said the ""fruits of Welsh economic recovery"" were evident across the country.
But he added the mixed figures show ""there is absolutely no room for complacency"" and the recovery was ""fragile"".","The number of people unemployed in Wales has fallen by more than a third in a year, official figures show."
48723,"By . Ted Thornhill . PUBLISHED: . 16:28 EST, 27 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:28 EST, 27 March 2012 . Shock waves from comets bombarding the Earth may have helped to build proteins and set the stage for life, scientists have learned. Comets, giant snowballs of ice and dust, are known to have carried organic chemicals and water to the early Earth. But just what caused life to spring out of nowhere on a barren and desolate planet billions of years ago remains a mystery. Rock on: It's thought that comets were responsible for kick-starting life on Earth . Now scientists may have part of the answer. Laboratory experiments have shown that amino acids - organic molecules that are the building blocks of proteins - would have survived violent comet impacts. What is more, the shock of a large comet impact would have provided the energy needed to start bonding amino acids together to make proteins. Proteins provide the raw material that allows all living things, from microbes to humans, to exist and function. Their creation by comets may explain how life appeared so quickly at the end of a period 3.8 billion years ago called the ‘late heavy bombardment’. During this turbulent time the Earth was showered by both comets and rocky asteroids, leaving crater scars that are still seen on the Moon. Dr Jennifer Blank, who led the U.S scientists from the Nasa/Ames Research Centre in Moffett Field, California, said: ‘Our research shows that the building blocks of life could, indeed, have remained intact despite the tremendous shock wave and other violent conditions in a comet impact. ‘Comets really would have been the ideal packages for delivering ingredients for the chemical evolution thought to have resulted in life. We like the comet delivery scenario because it includes all of the ingredients for life - amino acids, water and energy.’ Dr Blank described the experiments at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Diego, California. The first traces of life began about 3.5billion years ago, but it was 375million years ago that fish crawled out of the water . Her team set out to simulate conditions that existed when Earth was repeatedly struck by amino acid-carrying comets, some of which were 10 miles or more in diameter. One study used powerful gas guns to fire supersonic blasts of gas at capsules filled with amino acids, water and other materials. Despite the heat and shock of the simulated collisions the amino acids did not break down. Instead, they began forming the chain-like ‘peptide bonds’ that link amino acids together to make proteins. Intense pressure from the impact offset the intense heat and supplied the energy needed to create the peptides. Other experiments used computer models to simulate conditions as comets ploughed into the Earth's atmosphere. Both comets and asteroids may have brought multiple deliveries of the ‘seedlings of life’ to Earth, said Dr Blank.",The shock of a large comet impact would have provided the energy needed to start bonding amino acids together to make proteins.

A man who smashed up a police station and three emergency vehicles in a drunken rampage has been banned from carrying bricks by magistrates. The bizarre criminal behaviour order, a new form of Asbo, has been handed to Brett Cayzer, 52, after he wrecked three 999 vehicles - just three days after facing court for attacking a police station. Cayzer hurled two bricks through glass partitions at the police base in Ipswich, Suffolk, but was given a conditional discharge on Monday November 24. But, just three days after that hearing, he then used another brick to smash the windows and wing mirrors of two police cars and a paramedic's rapid response vehicle.

Ian Devine, prosecuting, said that shortly after midnight on Thursday police and a paramedic were treating a victim of an assault in the town when Cayzer bricked their vehicles. He told officers after discovering that one of his vendetta targets belonged to the ambulance service: 'The reason I smashed them was because they were police vehicles. 'I didn't actually realise it was a paramedic's car otherwise I wouldn't have touched it. 'I thought it was a police car.' Mr Devine said Cayzer was drunk both when he smashed up the emergency service vehicles and the police station on November 6. Sue Threadkell, defending, said he bitterly resented police after they upset him as he cared for his elderly dementia-stricken mother.

Millions of diners are too scared to eat oysters and prefer to eat fish fingers, rather than tucking into fish with eyes, a new study has revealed. Although cookery programmes are among the most popular shows on television, it seems that when it comes to adventurous eating it seems many of us have a long way to go. In fact, one in five adults are so put off by fish that they would only eat them if they were coated in breadcrumbs and shaped into 'fingers'. Phobia: Oysters have come top of a list of the nation's 10 most-feared foods, with a third of people refusing to eat them . The survey, carried out by restaurant chain Loch Fyne found that seafood was among the UK's most feared foods, with oysters coming out on top as a third of people refuse to eat them and one in 10 will not eat any fish whatsoever. Fish with eyes came second in the poll and anchovies were fifth, while shellfish and fish on the bone took up places eight and nine. Only offal and meat cooked rare managed to break the underwater monopoly on the top five spots, while blue cheese, liver and gherkins also appeared in the top 10. Childhood favourite: One in five adults are so put off by fish that they will only eat them in the form of fish fingers . Experts say many food phobics are put off by the smell, look and texture of fish and seafood. Food psychologist Dr Christy Fergusson said that many people were averse to eating fish because of a subconscious association with it. 'Perhaps the look of the whole fish with the eyes on the plate freaked them out as a child. Maybe the texture of seafood reminds them of something unpleasant,' she told the Mirror. Dr Fergusson said that some fussy eaters even chose to stay well clear of more popular foods, such as cottage cheese and baked beans - while the survey found that some people could not even bring themselves to eat chocolate or bagels. She added: 'One reason to explain this could be that as a child they experienced some form of stress or anxiety while eating the food or the texture or feel of the food reminded them of something unpleasant.'

Bill Craven, 74, steered his coach to safety after suffering a heart attack . Family and friends have paid tribute to a bus driver who managed to steer his coach to safety as he was dying after suffering a heart attack. Bill Craven, 74, drove his 60-seater holiday coach to the side of the road after falling ill and clipping a lamppost on the A1 motorway near Gateshead. The grandfather-of-three from Newcastle, was rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead but died shortly afterwards despite attempts to save him. His actions meant that the 46 passengers on board suffered no injuries, with only one other passenger taken to hospital and another seen by paramedics at the scene. The coach, which had adults and children on board, was travelling from Newcastle to Ambleside for a three-day holiday over the bank holiday weekend. Today his family said they had lost a dad, grandad and friend, while his employers Bells Coaches have commended Bill, who worked for the company for 16 years, for his bravery. Managing director Michael Bell said: 'Bill's actions whilst he was sufferinghis heart attack were heroic - he drove the bus away from the carriageway,brought it to a halt and stopped the engine - putting the safety of his passengers before his own. 'We will always be incredibly proud of Bill for what he did that day, and for the way he represented our business every day he worked for us.' Floral tributes still mark the spot where the accident happened and Mr Craven’s workcolleagues described him as a kind and thoughtful man, who lived for his family. Mr Craven's funeral was held on Thursday at West Road Crematorium Chapel. Thanks to Mr Craven's bravery, forty six passengers on board suffered no injuries . Firefighters from the surrounding area and two helicopters were called to the scene . His son Brian, 44, said: 'He was my best friend and we'llmiss him. He was an experienced driver and he loved meeting new people and taking them to new places. He was caring, polite and had integrity.' He added: 'What I thought was very touching,was a lady on the bus who helped him came to his funeral to express her condolence. She introduced herself to me. It was a lovely thing for a stranger to do.' Mr Bell added: ""We were privileged to have Bill work for us for over sixteen years. Throughout that time, he was a first-class colleague and employee. Paramedics treated one passenger at the scene and took Mr Craven and another person to hospital . 'The numerous messages of condolence that we have received since he died, are testament to the high esteem in which he was held by customers and other coach operators alike. They have highlighted Bill's professionalism, kindness and thoughtfulness to others.'

13502,"Japan's new prime minister on Friday offered the world a vision of his country as a reinvigorated Asian power, pledging to restore its influence in a region where it is increasingly eclipsed by China. ""Japan is not, and will never be, a tier-two country,"" Shinzo Abe said in a speech to members of the US foreign policy establishment, following his first meeting with President Barack Obama. ""It is high time, in this age of Asian resurgence, for Japan to bear even more responsibility to promote our shared rules and values."" Mr Abe's declaration that ""Japan is back"" could raise hackles in China, where a new leadership is keen to establish that country as a more dominant political force, befitting its position as Asia's largest economy. Mr Abe, a conservative nationalist, referred to a rare increase in Japan's military spending and made a forceful reassertion of Tokyo's claim to the Senkaku Islands, whose ownership has been contested by Beijing, saying Japan ""simply cannot tolerate any challenge now, or in the future"". But he also tried to assure US leaders that he was working to avoid escalating a dispute which Washington has made clear it does not want to be drawn into, suggesting he might be open to meeting Chinese leaders to try to ease tensions over the islands. ""The doors are always open on my side for the Chinese leaders,"" Mr Abe said. China on Friday criticised Mr Abe after the Washington Post published an interview quoting him as saying Beijing had a ""deeply ingrained"" need to challenge its neighbours over territory. Japanese officials said the quote was ""misleading"" and Mr Abe had not said China sought conflicts with other countries. Mr Abe came to Washington seeking to erase a perceived ambivalence about Japan's relations with the US that was created by the previous centre-left government, which Mr Abe's Liberal Democratic party defeated in national elections in December. Japan has swapped prime ministers six times since Mr Abe first held the office in a short and scandal-marred tenure from 2006 to 2007. One of his biggest challenges is to convince the Obama administration that his second stint will last long enough for him to follow through on his promises. Mr Abe has made a robust start, launching an economic stimulus programme of increased government spending and looser monetary policy that has lifted the Japanese stock market and pushed his poll ratings to around 70 per cent. Washington has been broadly supportive of the effort, even though it has led to a sharp fall in the yen that has alarmed some of Japan's trade partners and prompted concerns about a potential ""currency war"" of competitive devaluations. Mr Abe pressed his government's case that a healthier Japanese economy would be good for the rest of the world. ""Soon, Japan will export more, but it will import more as well. The US will be the first to benefit, followed by China, India, Indonesia and so on,"" he said. He also moved Japan a step closer to joining an effort to create a trans-Pacific free-trade zone. In a joint statement, Mr Abe and Mr Obama said ""all goods would be subject to negotiation"" should Japan join the US and a group of mostly Asian countries in talks over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but that ""it is not required to make a prior commitment to unilaterally eliminate all tariffs"". That wording appeared to be broad enough to allow Mr Abe to claim that joining negotiations would not break an election promise to protect Japanese farmers. ""It is my understanding that giving up all 'sacred areas' is not pre-condition,"" he said.","Japan's new prime minister has said it is time for Japan to ""be even more responsible"" to promote its shared values."
51732,"Vince Cable wants to see if there is enough evidence to start disqualification proceedings against Andy Hornby, Lord Stevenson and Sir James Crosby, a source told the BBC.
A report on Friday blamed them for failures in the bank's 2008 collapse.
Mr Cable ""feels outraged"" by the situation, the source said.
He has told officials at the investigations and enforcement branch of the government's Insolvency Service to see if there is sufficient evidence to start disqualification proceedings against the three, the Business Department confirmed.
HBOS collapsed in 2008, wiping out shareholders' assets and costing thousands of jobs.
The bank was then forced to merge with Lloyds in early 2009 and received a £20.5bn taxpayer bailout. It was one of the most high-profile casualties of the UK's banking crisis, which precipitated a wider economic downturn.
In its report on Friday, the Banking Standards Commission expressed frustration that City regulators had ""taken no steps"" to consider banning the three men from further involvement in financial services.
None of the men has been formally punished for their roles leading up to HBOS's failure, despite what the commission described as a ""colossal failure of management"" and a strategy dating back to 2001 that ""sowed the seeds of disaster"".
A Department for Business, Innovation and Skills spokesman said: ""The business secretary has instructed officials at the Insolvency Service to look into the Financial Conduct Authority report when it is published to see whether there are matters that could lead to further action.""
Sir James has a pension pot worth £25m, entitling him to an annual income of £700,000, The Sunday Times reported. He also made millions by selling some of his shares in the bank in 2006, well before the bank's collapse, the newspaper said.
Labour MP John Mann - who sits on the House of Commons' Treasury Committee - has called for Sir James, described as the ""architect"" of HBOS's downfall, to be stripped of his title.
Following the report, Sir James, who served as chief executive at HBOS between 2001 and 2006, resigned from an advisory position he held at London-based private equity firm Bridgepoint.
But he retains other positions, including the post of non-executive director at Compass Group, a food services company.
Calls to strip Sir James of his knighthood echo what happened to Fred Goodwin, the former chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, who lost his knighthood in 2012 after being held responsible for the biggest annual loss in UK corporate history.
Mr Goodwin eventually agreed to a cut in his pension following an outcry over what happened to RBS - to £350,000 a year.
Lord Stevenson, who presided as chairman of HBOS throughout its eight-year existence, is currently a non-executive director at the bookseller Waterstone's.
Mr Hornby, who took over the running of HBOS in 2006, has been the chief executive of gambling company Coral since 2011.

74557,"From samba and carnival to food, music and religion, African culture is everywhere in Brazil. The cultural heritage stems from the estimated four million slaves who were brought to the country over a 300-year period, at least four times as many as to the United States. Brazil was the last country to abolish the slave trade in 1888. More than half of Brazilians now identify themselves as black or of mixed race, according to the latest census. Rio de Janeiro now has the most famous carnival in the world, attracting an estimated 1.1 million visitors to the city this year and with 5.3 million people taking part in street parties, according to the English language newspaper The Rio Times. Carnival, which is celebrated across Brazil, combines samba -- music and dance which grew out of Brazil's black neighborhoods -- and the Catholic tradition of celebrating the run-up to Lent brought by Portuguese colonialists. After the abolition of slavery, the rituals of the Catholic former colonialists and their former slaves merged to form the origins of modern carnival, according to the Rio Times. Mixing sushi and samba - meet the Japanese Brazilians . One explanation for the origins of carnival is that it began in a Catholic church, Our Lady of the Rosary, built by slaves in the 1700s whose masters wanted them to convert to Catholicism. ""The black people that were part of this congregation, most of them came from Congo,"" said Joao Carlos Desales, a tour guide who took CNN around Rio de Janeiro. ""So they were able to organize a celebration where they would choose a man and a woman, and they would be the king and queen of Congo. That celebration turned out to be the beginning of carnival celebrated in Brazil."" Even many of Brazil's Catholic saints are said to have African heritage. St Benedict, whose name is remembered in Our Lady of the Rosary church, was a slave from North Africa, who promised to devote himself to Catholicism if he became a free man, Desales said. Brazil's patron saint, Our Lady of Aparecida, a black clay statue of the Virgin Mary, was -- according to some -- found by runaway slaves on their way to Quilombo, a community of runaway slaves. Quilombo communities continue across Brazil to this day. Luis Sacopa, president of the association of Quilombos, runs a restaurant with his 17 members of his family in a piece of jungle in what is now an expensive suburb of Rio de Janeiro. His grandparents found this piece of land after escaping slavery. The family has fought a legal battle to hold on to its land against the threat of eviction, and now has official protection for their right to remain. ""Thanks to god we have had success and we're still here at the end of our dispute,"" said Sacopa. ""Thanks to god, the family has united, we're fighting and we're winning the fight against the elite in this expensive neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro."" Sacopa said he was able to resist eviction with the help of his Orixas, gods of the Yoruba people of Southwest Nigeria, Benin and Togo. In Brazil, the religion is known as Candomble, and it has a large following in some Afro-Brazilian areas, particularly Salvador in Bahia state. Also on Inside Africa: Why Tanzanians believe in witchcraft . Candomble was prohibited in Brazil up until the 1950s, but influenced much of the country's food and music. In Sacopa's restaurant he serves feijoada, a typical Brazilian dish originally created by slaves from their masters' leftovers. A new Historical Circuit of African Heritage opened in Rio de Janeiro in 2010 to help tourists and descendants of slaves reconnect with the past slavery. The project began after workers installing a new drainage system in the central districts of Saude and Gamboa discovered hundreds of personal objects belonging to African slaves, according to the Rio Times. Archaeologists established that this was the site of the 19th century slave trading complex, the Cais do Valongo, or Valongo Quays. Many of the discoveries are now on display in the Valongo Gardens, the newspaper reported. Another discovery of recent years is the remains of a squalid slave cemetery in the courtyard of a home in central Rio de Janeiro. Renaldo Tavares, an archeologist who has been studying the discovery, said: ""These are human remains mixed in with the garbage from the city. It shows how society in the 19th century treated slaves. ""Bones, pieces of ceramic, bits from construction, tiles, animal remains, bits of food, society threw all sorts of things in here. Slaves were considered garbage by society."" Ana de la Merced Guimaraes, the homeowner who discovered the bones in her courtyard, said: ""When we started a reform in our house, we found all these bones. We thought it was a family grave, but there was so much we thought maybe it had been a serial killer. ""But then we calmed down and talked about it and called a lawyer and the police. And he said don't worry, we aren't going to accuse you, it's probably something very old. ""A neighbor told us, a long time ago, your street was a slave cemetery."" Brazil's third city Salvador, in Bahia state, northeast Brazil, has some of the strongest links to Africa. Salvador was the first colonial capital of Brazil and its central district, Pelourinho, now a UNESCO world heritage site, was the New World's first slave market from 1553, according to UNESCO.",Brazil was the last country to abolish the slave trade in 1888.

Silvio Berlusconi committed fraud at his media empire even when he served as prime minister of Italy, a judge has ruled. The three time Italian premier, 76, was involved in fraud ‘for many years’ and ‘continued despite the public roles assumed.' He conducted it ‘in the highest possible positions’, an explanation published today for a judgement upholding Berlusconi’s conviction for tax fraud said. The billionaire politician, who made an extraordinary comeback to take second place in February’s elections, was last October sentenced to four years in jail for his part in deals for TV rights bought by his Mediaset network. His centre right party is now back in government as part of a coalition. There was both oral and written evidence that Berlusconi ‘directly managed the first stages of an ‘enormous tax evasion’ scam using offshore companies, the judgement said. Berlusconi claims that he was not party to any of the fraudulent film-rights deals as he was too busy in his political role. But in the explanation judges said it was obvious Berlusconi 'remained interested and involved in management decisions, while abandoning the day-to-day operations.' The one-time Italian leader is set to appeal against the ruling, which also bars him from holding public office for five years. In Italy sentences for non-violent crimes do not usually take effect until the appeals system has been exhausted. But, even if his conviction is upheld by . the Supreme Court, the centre right leader is, at 76, too old to go to . jail in Italy, where over 70s usually serve time under house arrest. At 76, Silvio Berlusconi, pictured last month, is too old to go to jail, despite the ruling that he committed fraud . The ex-premier is also facing a six-year sentence for allegedly paying for sex with an minor in a trial in which the verdict is due next month.

77587,"By . Martha De Lacey . PUBLISHED: . 07:42 EST, 31 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:58 EST, 31 October 2012 . Billy's owners had always found his puppy dog eyes impossible to resist. And as a result the lovable cocker spaniel was forever eating scraps from their plates, naughty treats and sweet snacks - as well as munching through four meals of actual dog food a day. But Jane and George Hunter from North Lanarkshire, Scotland, realised things had got out of hand when six-year-old Billy became so fat he couldn't jump onto the sofa, and walking for just five minutes left him gasping for breath. Supersize spaniel: Billy the cocker spaniel when he weighed over 23kg before his crash diet and new fitness regime gave him a new lease of life . At 23.5kg (52lbs) - and with the average weight of a healthy cocker spaniel being between six and 17kg (15 and 37lbs)  - Billy had been pampered into obesity. When Jane, 68, noticed her beloved pet could no longer climb onto the sofa . because of his growing bulge she enrolled him in a special pet fit club. And six months later Billy has shed 6.9kg (15lbs), now weighing in at a trim . 16.6kg (36.5lbs) and regularly breezes through four-mile walks. Jane, from North Lanarkshire, Scotland, said: 'Billy is a . different dog. He runs all over the place, we walk him four times a day . and he loves it. 'Before, he couldn’t do anything, he couldn't jump on the bed, or the . sofa and after five minutes out walking he would be out of breath. He . was like an old man of about 90. 'We just didn't realise that giving in to his puppy dog eyes was so bad for his waistline.' Fit as a fiddle: PDSA Vet Nurse Kirsty MacDougall checks Billy the cocker spaniel's new svelte waistline following his six-month diet plan . Billy was found wondering the streets in Salsburgh, North Lanarkshire, as an 11-week-old puppy by a member of the public and handed into the police. He was taken in by Jane and George who spent five years feeding him an excessive diet of tinned dog food, supplemented with sweet snacks and treats from the dinner table. But last November Jane, a retired nursery worker, noticed a decline in Billy’s health and enrolled him at a special fit club run by the Peoples Dispensary for Sick Animals at Glasgow East PDSA Pet Aid hospital. Proud owners: George and Jane Hunter with slimming Billy the dieting spaniel . Big fella: 'Before, he couldn¿t do anything, he couldn't jump on the bed, or the sofa and after five minutes out walking he would be out of breath - he was like an old man of about 90' Vets weighed the unfit pooch and were astonished to find that Billy was 34 per cent heavier than the recommended weight for a dog of his size and breed. Jane, a grandmother of six, said: 'Billy would get everything - left-overs, treats or a piece of cake on someone's birthday. He could eat all day. 'We loved him to bits but we didn't realise what damage we were doing.' Billy was put on a special diet of dried . dog food and after just four mouths weighed 18kg (39.6lbs). He went on . to lose more weight and is now fitter than ever. Puppy love: Billy the super-slimming dog as a rescue puppy, when he was taken in by Jane and George Harris . Jane added: 'The PDSA have done wonders with him. Getting Billy to stick to the diet was something of a challenge at the start as human food had become a much loved part of his life. 'But now he's a new dog. He really is marvellous and great with the grandkids. We walk him four times a day and then on a weekend we do about four miles around the park. 'Billy runs around without getting out of breath and is generally happier in everything he does.' Siobhan Casey, senior vet at Glasgow East PDSA Pet Aid hospital, said: 'This is a great success story for all concerned, and Jane has clearly done a wonderful job in managing Billy’s food intake and safely increasing his activity levels.' Fluffball: Billy before his diet, during which his owners were taught that dogs should stick to food that is designed for them, not for humans .

88616,"Deals at today's price are called the ""spot"" market and bets can also be made on forward exchange rates.
In all, $5.3 trillion (Â£3.3tn) was traded per day on the forex markets in 2013, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
To put that in context, that's just over double the annual economic output of the UK, which was $2.52tn in 2013, according to the World Bank.
Currency trading started out as a way for businesses and individuals to change money for overseas travel and commerce. This was a real service industry driven by the underlying level of world trade.
Opportunities for speculation were limited by the Bretton Woods agreement in 1944 to peg exchange rates to the gold price. In the early 1970s, this accord broke down, exchange rates began to fluctuate more widely and globalisation created more underlying demand for foreign exchange.
Financial institutions saw a new opportunity to make money from the increased size and volatility of the forex market. Today only a fraction of currency trading is directly related to the original purpose of facilitating cross-border trade: the rest is speculative.
There is no physical forex marketplace and nearly all trading takes place on electronic systems operated by the big banks and other providers.
Dealers display the prices at which they are prepared to buy and sell currencies: users place orders with the click of a mouse.
Prices change according to supply and demand. For example, if the US dollar is more popular than the euro at any given time, the dollar will strengthen against the euro and vice versa.
Prices are constantly changing on a second-by-second basis as currencies respond to the changing flow of economic news.
About 40% of the world's dealing goes through trading rooms in London.
Prices in the forex market change so rapidly that it is difficult to establish the going rate for particular currencies at any one time. In order to help businesses and investors value their multi-currency assets and liabilities, a daily exchange rate fix is held.
Until recently, this was based on actual currency deals that took place in a window 30 seconds before and 30 seconds after 16:00 London time. WM-Reuters then calculated the fix rates based on these observed transactions, which form the benchmarks for that day.
The probity of this public information is very important, as it is the peg on which many other financial markets depend.
Because the fix was based on actual transactions over a short period of time, the potential existed for market players to get together and place orders during the 60-second window.
If they were big enough, they could affect the benchmark calculation and create profit opportunities for their firms.
Last November, regulators said that some forex traders at five of the biggest banks had been doing just that for several years. They concluded that through online chat rooms with exotic names such as The Bandits Club, The Cartel and The Mafia, traders colluded to place aggressive ""buy"" or ""sell"" orders - known in the business as ""banging the close""- in order to distort the fix.
This had apparently been going on for several years. Embarrassingly for the managers meant to have been in charge of the traders, suspicious price movements were first highlighted by a whistleblower.
Clues that were available to outsiders should have been picked up internally long ago, but prime responsibility lies with those who participated directly.
The practice appears to have been so common amongst influential traders that the phrase Warren Buffett described as the five most dangerous words in business, ""everyone else is doing it"", comes to mind.
The Financial Stability Board, a watchdog that advises the G20 finance ministers, has set up a task force to recommend reforms of the forex market. As a result, the window in which the daily 4pm fix is calculated has been extended from one minute to five minutes. This makes it harder to manipulate.
In addition to the five minute fix, the central banks' co-ordinator - the Bank for International Settlements - is trying to get all the banks to agree a unified code of conduct, but this has not yet been settled.
Ironically, the forex market had been considered by regulators too big to be manipulated and it has been largely unregulated. Yet there were some early warning signs that all was not well.
Minutes of a meeting of dealers at the Bank of England back in 2006 appear to suggest that the possibility of market manipulation was discussed in front of officials, but the Bank of England denies this interpretation. Nine years on, it has led global regulators in cleaning up the forex market - and not before time, critics will say.
Institutional cheating of the kind we have seen in the Libor and forex scandals will probably die out for a while.
Individual traders have seen colleagues marched off the trading floor to face questioning.
Managers have finally understood the need for line-by-line, desk-by-desk scrutiny.
Regulators now know that light-touch regulation was an invitation to the financial services industry to game the rules and they have responded with more intrusive supervision and hefty deterrents.
Against this background, it would be surprising if systemic malpractice were to continue in the immediate future. But there is no room for complacency in an industry where corporate memories are short and rewards for beating the market are great.

Terry, 31, was stripped of the armband pending his trial in July over alleged racial abuse of QPR's Anton Ferdinand.
On Sunday, Capello said he ""absolutely"" did not agree with the decision.
Players' Union boss Gordon Taylor said England coach Capello's criticism was ""bizarre"" but Ferguson said: ""There's nothing wrong with having an opinion.""
Terry remains eligible for selection, despite losing the captaincy.
But Ferguson added: ""I think what will happen in the next few days is there will have to be a coming together of the FA hierarchy and Fabio Capello because he's the team manager, he has the importance of that position.
""Without question the most important person at a football club is the manager.""
It was widely accepted that England coach Fabio Capello was unhappy at the FA's decision to strip John Terry of the captaincy - but to go public with his concerns may be regarded by the hierarchy as unhelpful and likely to prolong the debate.
The FA will not, however, be going back on the decision so Capello must accept it and move on if England's preparations for Euro 2012 are to progress with any degree of calmness.
And of course, Capello's public loyalty and faith in his deposed captain may also be seen as undermining the credibility of his eventual successor.
However, Taylor, who is the Professional Footballers' Association chief, told BBC sports news correspondent Dan Roan: ""I cannot understand why he [Capello] came out so blatantly against the decision.
""I don't know what purpose it serves... it means there's not the right atmosphere conducive to a successful tournament [the European Championship in June and July].
""It asks a question of the unity of the FA and makes it difficult for whoever takes over the captaincy.
""The FA's decision was made to take the heat out of the situation, which has festered. It was a decision to focus on the football.
""And if the FA thought that was best for the team you would expect the manager to go with that.""
Sports minister Hugh Robertson has backed the FA, no matter what the consequences.
""The FA had a difficult decision to make and took the right decision,"" he told Sky Sports News.
""If the consequence of that is the manager [and] John Terry walk away, I would regret both of those two things enormously, but so be it.""
On Sunday, England manager Capello told Italy's state broadcaster RAI he did not believe someone should be punished by sporting authorities before a court had reached a verdict.
""I thought it was right that Terry should keep the captain's armband,"" the 65-year-old Italian said.
""I have spoken to the [FA] chairman and I have said that in my opinion one cannot be punished until it is official and the court - a non-sport court, a civil court - had made a decision to decide if John Terry has done what he is accused of.""
More than three-quarters of fans surveyed by a university backed the decision to strip John Terry of the England captaincy. Staffordshire University surveyed 1,000 visitors to a range of football websites. As well as 78% backing the FA's decision over Terry, 34% believed he should be in England's Euro 2012 squad. Steven Gerrard was  the firm favourite to take over as captain, with 44%, followed by Scott Parker 12% and Joe Hart 9%. 87% of respondents to the university's survey at www.topfan.co.uk  were male, while researchers say all parts of the country were represented.
Capello, whose first game in charge was on 6 February, 2008 against Switzerland, is set to meet FA chairman David Bernstein this week, but it is understood that the Italian is keen to remain in charge for Euro 2012, which takes place in Poland and Ukraine this summer.
Davies, who left the FA a year and a half before Capello was hired, added: ""There is strong leadership now at the FA from David Bernstein.
""Last week, he wasn't slow to take things forward and he may not be slow to do so now.""
Davies told the BBC that the former Real Madrid and AC Milan manager's outspoken actions have frustrated his employer.
""My understanding - and I've talked to one or two very senior people at the FA in the last 24 hours - is that this matter with Capello is regarded very seriously,"" he said.
""He may well have breached his contract. There is a view that publicly this sort of matter shouldn't be aired in this sort of way.
""It will be for others to know the fine print of Capello's contract and I suspect people will look at it.""","England manager Fabio Capello has said he is ""blatantly"" against the Football Association's decision to strip John Terry of the captaincy."

79209,"They may not look like the most spacious, or glamorous, of buildings. But these shipping containers have been earmarked as a novel way to tackle the housing crisis in Detroit, Michigan. In one of the city's sprawling factories, the first converted shipping container is being constructed and it is hoped it might potentially be a model for the future. The first shipping container converted home is being constructed in a Detroit General Motors factory . It is hoped the shipping container idea could take off and be used as a way to tackle the city's housing crisis . Once the finishing touches have been applied, the container will be delivered to Michigan Urban Farming Initiative's headquarters in Detroit's North End neighborhood. It will serve as a base for university student caretakers for the nonprofit group and agricultural research activities. The 40-foot long container will feature 320 square feet of living space with two bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen. It is hoped the shipping container idea could go some way to helping Detroit's housing problems - the city has roughly 40,000 vacant homes waiting to be demolished. Tyson Gersh, from the Michigan Urban Farming Initiative, said: 'It's scalable, works for everyone and it's also not going to ruin the environment. It's easier to maintain and can re-purpose existing materials.' The home is being prepared inside General Motors' Hamtramck Assembly plant in the city, which usually produces the electric Chevrolet Volt and other vehicles. Mr Gersh and others from the farming group met with the automaker a couple years ago, and came up with the idea. GM spokesman David Darovitz said: 'I loved the creative idea of taking and reusing an old shipping container and giving new life. It can be used as a model for a bigger idea.' The unusual building is viewed as a way to tackle the deteriorating and disappearing housing in Detroit . Shipping containers converted in to living or working spaces are common in some other cities. For instance, in Salt Lake City's rundown warehouse district, a nonprofit group last year converted them into 'micro-retail' spaces. It was in 2006 that California architect Peter DeMaria designed the first two-story shipping container home in the US, Redondo Beach Home. This in turn inspired the creation of Logical Homes, a company based on the idea of converting containers in to homes. The container will be used as a base for university student caretakers and agricultural research activities .","The 40-foot long container will feature 320 square feet of living space with two bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen.

25969,"Taiwan's foreign minister announced the relaxing of all 11 measures, including a freeze on hiring Filipino workers.
The Philippine coast guard shot fisherman Hung Shih-cheng on 9 May.
On Wednesday Manila recommended homicide charges against eight coast guards who admitted firing weapons.
""The government of the Republic of China [Taiwan] announces that the sanction against the Philippines is removed immediately after the Filipino side has displayed apology and goodwill in written statements and action,"" AFP news agency quoted Taiwan's foreign ministry as saying on Thursday.
Mr Hung, 65, was shot in waters which both sides say lie within their 200-nautical-mile from shore exclusive economic zone.
The Philippines initially said the shooting - which sparked a serious diplomatic row - was an act of self-defence, but has now concluded that its coast guard officers used excessive force.
The Philippine president sent special envoy Amadeo Perez to visit the fisherman's family in southern Taiwan on Thursday.
""I have been authorised by President Benigno Simeon C Aquino III to personally convey the president and the Filipino people's deep regret and apology to the family of Mr Hung Shih-cheng over the unfortunate loss of life of their beloved one,"" said Mr Perez.
The family has accepted the apology and reached an agreement with Manila on compensation for their loss.
The two sides have begun fishing talks in which they both agreed to not use force in dealing with each other's fishermen, reports the BBC's Cindy Sui from Taipei.
They also agreed to inform each other about the arrests of the other's fishermen and to set up a system for handling detentions and release of fishing crews.
Taiwan was angered by what it considered to be a slow and insincere response from the Philippines, our correspondent adds.
Its hiring freeze had prevented around 10,000 Filipino migrant workers from obtaining work permits.
Taiwan's government on Thursday said it hoped to restore good relations with the Philippines.
But it asked Manila to prosecute the responsible officers in a timely manner and schedule a next round of talks on fishing rights to prevent similar incidents from happening again, our correspondent says.",Taiwan has lifted sanctions against the Philippines after a fisherman was shot dead by the country's coast guard.
98289,"The NHS is paralysed by a Mafia-style code of silence that stops whistleblowers highlighting poor care, MPs were told last night. Even senior surgeons fear drawing attention to dangers to patients in case it should damage their career. David Prior, the chairman of the Care Quality Commission watchdog, said there was a ‘chilling’ culture in NHS hospitals that discouraged potential whistleblowers from breaking ranks. Concern: David Prior, the chairman of the Care Quality Commission, told the Commons health select committee there was a 'chilling' culture in NHS hospitals that discouraged potential whistleblowers from breaking ranks . Medics who wish to expose failing hospitals have to be ‘very, very brave’, he told a Commons committee. He said senior doctors’ career prospects had been ruined after they dared to speak out. There have been a series of scandals involving whistleblowers whose concerns were covered up by an NHS keen to sweep poor care under the carpet. Campaigner Julie Bailey was ignored when she campaigned about poor standards at Mid Staffordshire NHS trust, where up to 1,200 died needlessly from neglect in appalling conditions. Hundreds of former NHS staff are under gagging orders to ensure they did not speak out about poor care. Highlighting the need to break down the NHS’s ‘tribal’ culture of banning criticism, Mr Prior told the Commons health select committee: ‘I have spoken to a couple of surgeons whose careers have been severely limited because they expressed concerns about what was going on at their hospitals.’ He said he had found it ‘chilling’ to . hear a senior clinician ask why doctors did not raise concerns about . unusually high mortality rates and poor care of patients at the . Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust. Previous stories: The Mail revealed last month that NHS bosses have spent £4million in three years secretly gagging whistleblowers concerned about patient care . ‘For years, this dreadful care went on and no doctor put his head above the parapet,’ he said. ‘Why is that? One part of the answer is that they are frightened. ‘Even if you are an alpha-male surgeon, you are frightened. We might feel that’s not good enough, but that is the situation.’ 'For years, this dreadful care went on and no doctor put his head above the parapet. Why is that? One part of the answer is that they are frightened' David Prior, CQC chairman . Committee member David Tredinnick said NHS trusts operated under ‘omerta’ – the Mafia’s code of silence, adding: ‘It is about organisations closing ranks so tightly that if anyone steps out of line they are finished. ‘It is a kind of Mafia code, an omerta, where you do anything against the status quo of the organisation and you are finished. That is something that surely needs to be broken.’ Joyce Robbins, of the pressure group Patient Concern, said: ‘If you are an innocent patient you will be scared by this. ‘It is horrific to think that doctors know of problems but cannot speak out. We only hear about it when there is a big case like Mid Staffs, but now it seems it is more widespread.’ The Mail revealed last month that NHS . bosses have spent £4million in three years secretly gagging . whistleblowers concerned about patient care. Making herself heard: Campaigner Julie Bailey (pictured with Prime Minister David Cameron) was ignored when she campaigned about poor standards at Mid Staffordshire NHS trust, where up to 1,200 died needlessly . Dozens of doctors, nurses and other staff have been quietly paid off in return for not speaking out. One of them was Gary Walker, former boss of United Lincolnshire Hospitals, who was given £500,000 to leave quietly after repeatedly warning that targets were being put ahead of patients. He received the hush money to prevent him going public with his fears that the ‘target culture’ at the trust could cost lives. 'It is a kind of Mafia code, an omerta, where you do anything against the status quo of the organisation and you are finished. That is something that surely needs to be broken' David Tredinnick, Commons health select committee member . As many as 500 patients may have died needlessly because of poor care – but his concerns were ignored, and he said he was ‘thrown to the wolves’ for speaking out. The new leadership of the Care Quality Commission want to make it easier for doctors and nurses to trigger inspections of their hospitals by coming to them with concerns about patient safety. Mr Prior and chief executive David Behan were appointed within the past year to lead a shake-up of the CQC after it came in for harsh criticism over its response to scandals including Mid-Staffordshire and Morecambe Bay, where babies died needlessly in maternity units. They told MPs they were bringing in a new . regime of specialist inspections of hospitals, care homes and . surgeries, which will eventually see ratings published not only for each . service but also for individual departments within hospitals. Mr Prior said: ‘How we enable people to raise concerns with us at a much earlier stage in confidence is incredibly important. Answering questions: Mr Prior (left) and chief executive David Behan (right) were appointed within the past year to lead a shake-up of the CQC after it came in for harsh criticism over its response to scandals . ‘We need to get a continuous flow of information from staff and residents and patients and carers. That’s our best source of information. ‘What we have got to do is to be absolutely sure when we do an inspection that hospitals have got proper whistleblowing, concern-raising, procedures within the hospital and that there is real clinical engagement. ‘And we have got to be a safety net and be available to these people at a much earlier stage so they can ring us up, get in touch with us and that can precipitate an inspection.’ Mr Prior acknowledged that the CQC’s new inspection regime was ‘a work in progress’, but said the first 18 inspections would be completed by Christmas, with reports published by February. He and Mr Behan were challenged over their decision to clear head of media Anna Jefferson of wrongdoing over a report into the watchdog’s handling of complaints about maternity unit deaths at Morecambe Bay. An independent report suggested Miss Jefferson was involved in preventing the publication of the results of an internal inquiry because of fears it would damage the watchdog’s reputation. But Mr Prior insisted the report had not come to the conclusion that any individual was guilty. A Labour spokesman said: ‘Labour supports protection for whistleblowers in the NHS. But this Government needs to do more to support frontline NHS staff.’","David Prior said there was a 'chilling' culture in NHS hospitals that discouraged potential whistleblowers from breaking ranks.

52860,"The 60kg calf named Bonnie was born at the park, near Stirling, following a 16-month pregnancy.
Keepers said the birth marked an important step in the work to save the species from extinction.
Southern white rhinos, native to the south of Africa, are currently listed as near-threatened on the IUCN red list of endangered species.
The calf is the fifth to be born at the park to mother Dot and father Graham, both aged 16.
Animal collection manager Sheila Walker said: ""The birth was very straightforward and the calf was up on its feet and suckling in just over an hour.
""Dot is a great mum and very experienced, having successfully raised four calves previously. She was even giving gentle nudges, encouraging the calf to its feet - but it managed all by itself, albeit a bit wobbly at first.""
Despite its endangered listing, the white rhino has fared far better than its northern counterpart, which was declared extinct in the wild in 2008. About 18,000 southern white rhinos remain in the wild.
The animal's decline has been blamed on poaching in Africa. Blair Drummond said it was committed to doing its bit to help save the species from extinction.
Ailsa McCormick, head keeper of the park's large mammals, said: ""The calf is of big importance to the endangered species breeding programme, and I'm delighted to oversee Dot and Graham's continued part in ensuring a strong viable insurance population for southern white rhinos.
""This calf is their fifth, and being grandparents at 16 years old, Dot and Graham's latest calf is a big feather in the cap for the ongoing conservation efforts made by Blair Drummond.""
The park said it had been receiving messages from well-wishers after people viewed the birth live via a webcam.",A southern white rhino calf has been born at Blair Drummond National Park.

14613,"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 11:31 EST, 18 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:39 EST, 18 March 2013 . Jailed: Adam Garthwaite has been sentenced to 12 months in a young offenders institution . An agriculture student has been sent to prison for killing a motorist after he lost control of his car because he was eating crisps. Teenager Adam Garthwaite was driving home from college on country roads when his van veered off course and crashed head-on into an oncoming car. The other driver, 38-year-old Paul Garcia, who lived with his wife and two young children in Launceston, Cornwall, died instantly in the crash. Garthwaite, 19, terrified motorists in the minutes before the smash in March last year as he tailgated other cars and overtook at speed while driving near the border between Devon and Cornwall. He later said he had no memory of how the crash happened, but police found a half-full bag of crisps in the car and suggested that he had not been paying attention to the road while he ate the snack. The student sobbed uncontrollably throughout the hearing at Exeter Crown Court, which was attended by the victim's family as well as his own relatives. Before the accident, he was a prize-winning young farmer who had won an award as Shepherd of the Year and already looked after his own flock. Garthwaite, of Frithelstock in Devon, admitted causing death by careless driving and dangerous driving. He was sentenced to 12 months in a young offenders institution and banned from driving for two years. Court: The 19-year-old agriculture student was handed his sentence at Exeter Crown Court . Judge Francis Gilbert told him: 'I accept you have been clearly affected by the consequences of this accident but I also have to consider the consequences for the deceased's widow and his two very young children, which are entirely predictable in the circumstances. 'This was a case of inattention. The positioning of your car on the wrong side of the road may not have been deliberate but it created a very obvious danger and had fatal consequences. 'You allowed your car to become a serious danger to others. I consider this case comes into a category of falling not far short of dangerous driving.' Andrew MacFarlane, prosecuting, said Garthwaite was driving back from the Duchy College at Callington on the A388 and had a friend in the car with him. The dangerous driving took place just before and inside St Giles-in-the-Heath, where he overtook two cars at such speed that one passenger called him a 'plonker' and a learner driver told her instructor that he would end up in hospital. Police experts were baffled as to the cause of the crash until they examined the inside of his car. Mr MacFarlane said: 'They found a quantity of crisps on the dashboard and the thought occurs that he may have been consuming them, although he denied that possibility.' Jason Taylor, defending, said Garthwaite is so racked by guilt that he is now a broken shell of a man, accepts he deserves to be punished and has written a letter of apology to Mr Garcia's widow. He said before the crash he ran his own farming business as well as studying at college and was a prominent Young Farmer, winning an award as Young Shepherd of the Year. Mr Taylor said: 'The evidence in this case points to inattention, whether because he was talking to his passenger or because of the bag of crisps.'

'I had £4,000 in redundancy, so moved to London with big plans - and ran out of money 2 weeks later,' he told MailOnline. 'Me and Roger Evans (who plays Owen's best friend Horsey in the film) had an idea, about this Welsh guy who came to London, his best friend was a record company boss.' The pair filmed the sketch in Soho, and uploaded it to YouTube. After an article appearing in the Evening Standard newspaper in London, it began to spread online. 'Loads of industry people wanted to get involved, including Alan McGee, Carl Barat and Martin Freeman,' said Owen. The pair then created a series of six episodes on a shoestring budget.

Katie Beddo, 31, from Darlington, County Durham, immediately thought 'his owner must be a bit of a laugh to do that', and decided to get in touch. Farmer Richard Craggs, 30, had been on Match.com for months without success, so for a laugh switched his profile image to one of his pet pooch George. Katie was smitten by cute George on Richard's profile - who now has a daughter, two year-old Labrador Ebony . But when dog-lover Katie spotted it she was so smitten by the cute Labrador she contacted Richard  to praise him for his wit and adorable pet. Five years on and the pair have married, have a 12 week-old daughter Bethany and live together at Katie's home. George the dog even had an important role at the wedding as their ring-bearer, carrying a cushion in his mouth down the aisle. Primary school teacher Katie said: 'I always wanted a dog so when I spotted George online it made me laugh and think 'Aww how cute!' 'I had only been on the site for a few weeks when I spotted the bizarre profile picture of George. 'When I clicked on it and read Richard's profile the idea he had used George's picture really tickled me so I contacted him through the site. Richard's pet George is a working dog and helps him out on his brother and parent's family-run farm . 'I messaged him saying 'Does your dog know you are looking for love?!' 'We got on great straight away and just weeks later went on our first date and two months later he even joined my family on holiday in Spain. 'As we jetted out he asked me 'So do I tell people I'm your friend or your boyfriend?' 'I said 'Go on then... my boyfriend' - and that was that.' Richard's pet George is a proper working dog and helps him out on his brother and parent's family-run farm in Yarm, North Yorks.

About 18 months after they met online Richard proposed and the couple married the following year . Katie went on: 'About 18 months after we first met Richard proposed and we married the following year at the local church. 'George was the ring-bearer and looked so adorable. 'Now we have [our daughter] beautiful Bethany and George has his own daughter, a two year-old black Labrador called Ebony.' Katie admits she may never have found Richard or George after dismissing at first the idea of going on a dating site. She explained: 'Being a primary school teacher and in my late 20s most of my working day is spent with young children or women. 'Then when I went out with my friends most of them were already in stable relationships or even married with kids. 'Meeting single men my own age was becoming more difficult so my mum and best friends were telling me to give Internet dating a try. 'I thought basically it was not for me at all and went on it to prove my mum wrong.

David Griffiths, . 35, (right) and former boxer Brett Flournoy, 31, (left) were shot dead on a remote farm in Cornwall . in June 2011. An inquest has heard they were killed unlawfully . The bodies of Flournoy, 31, from The . Wirral, and Griffiths, from Berkshire, were unearthed by police after . Stone confessed to having disposed of the corpses. Today's inquest heard father-of-three Griffiths, and pro boxer Flournoy were killed with a 12-bore shotgun by Haigh. Former cage fighter Thomas Haigh, 26, was jailed last year for a minimum of 35 years for shooting dead the men . His 'thick' accomplice Ross Stone, 26, then stuffed the bodies into a Citroen Berlingo, set it alight and buried the vehicle in a pit at the farm where he worked, it was said. The inquest heard the two victims worked for an IRA gang that ran Liverpool’s illegal drugs trade and Haigh and Stone owed them £40,000. The dealers wanted Haigh to pay them back by travelling to Brazil to bring back cocaine. But when Flournoy and Griffiths arrived at Stone’s farm on June 16, 2011, Haigh blasted them with a shotgun. Haigh and Stone tried to cover their tracks with the DIY cremation but Stone later told officers where the charred remains were buried. Despite their convictions, an inquest attempted to resolve unanswered questions about how Griffiths and Flournoy died and exactly how their bodies were destroyed. Detective Constable Steve Hambly of Devon and Cornwall Police told the hearing the pair were shot in the back and the face. DC Hambly said: 'I believe Brett Flournoy suffered one shot to his back and this shot proved fatal. It may have taken place close to the farmhouse. 'I believe that David Griffiths suffered a fatal shot to his right shoulder and on the side of his face. 'There is no evidence that they survived past June 16, 2011 or that a third person was connected to the murders. 'In my opinion, the deaths of these two men resulted in a fall out whilst the four of them were involved in a global enterprise - a drugs supply.' During his trial it emerged Stone, who lived at the farm where he worked as a digger driver, had links with large-scale suppliers in Merseyside. He would buy cocaine, amphetamines and ecstasy before selling them on locally but trouble began when drugs worth £40,000 went missing from his home. Inferno: The Citroen Berlingo van in which the two men were torched . The excavated site where the burned-out van was buried by accomplice Ross Stone, who worked at the farm . Stone admitted burning the men's bodies and burying them in a huge pit at Sunny Corner farm at Trenance Downs in Cornwall . The two victims worked . for an IRA gang that ran Liverpool’s illegal drugs trade - Haigh and . Stone owed them £40,000. The inquest attempted to resolve unanswered . questions about how they died and exactly how their . bodies were destroyed . The drugs disappeared but the dealers . who had supplied them, Flournoy and Griffiths, still wanted their money . and went to the farm. Flournoy, of Bebington on the Wirral, Merseyside, and Griffiths, 35, from Bracknell, Berkshire, were then shot by Haigh. Gunned down: Brett Flournoy was killed by Haigh, who wanted him to travel to Brazil to bring back cocaine . His . trial later heard Haigh had been placed at the farm as a lodger by the . two gang members to keep an eye on 'thick Cornish farmer' Stone. But Haigh killed them with a shotgun and Stone then scooped the two corpses into a wheelbarrow before using heavy machinery to dig a massive grave, the inquest heard. He then put the pair in their van and set it alight before rolling it into the pit and later covering it over. Stone later admitted 'tidying up' afterwards - including dumping the shotgun and blotting up pools of blood in the farm lane using cement powder. The makeshift grave went undiscovered for several weeks until Stone was arrested on an unrelated drugs charge. He confessed to helping destroy the bodies but denied taking part in the shootings. Haigh, of Huddersfield, fled back to Yorkshire before eventually handing himself in. Coroner Emma Carlyon said: 'Brett Flournoy and David Griffiths travelled to Cornwall to visit Sunny Corner at Trenance Downs near St Austell. 'This was with the view to commit criminal or drug activities. The remains of their bodies was located in their badly burnt vehicle, a Citroen Berlingo van which was buried in a pit on the grounds of Sunny Corner. 'Other bone fragments of the men were found close to the van. The two men were shot with a gun, not recovered, and buried in their van which was burnt.' She recorded a verdict of unlawful killing.","Thomas Haigh, 26, shot dead David Griffiths, 35, and Brett Flournoy, 31. Haigh wanted him to travel to Brazil to bring back cocaine, inquest hears.

90641,"India approved a distinct symbol for its currency, the rupee, Thursday, joining the league of currencies identifiable by their unique signs. Up to this point, the Indian rupee has been denoted by ""Rs"" or the abbreviation INR. The new symbol, which looks like an R in Hindi, with an intersecting horizontal line, was selected after a public contest involving 3,000 designs, Ambika Soni, India's information and broadcasting minister, said. The move to give to its currency a new recognition stems from the country's economic growth, the minister said. ""The symbol for the rupee would lend a distinctive character and identity to the currency and further highlight the strength and robustness of the Indian economy as also a favored destination for global investments,"" Soni said. She also noted that the symbol would help distinguish the Indian rupee from the namesake currencies of several other nations like Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Apart from citing her country's rapid integration with the global economy as a reason for adopting a symbol for the Indian rupee, Soni also noted the cultural importance to the new currency, because of its resemblance to Hindi's R. The symbol ""reflects and captures the Indian ethos and culture,"" she said. One of the world's few growth markets after the global recession, India expects its gross domestic product to grown 8.5 percent in 2010-11, despite being faced with a consolidated fiscal deficit of 8.4 percent.","India approves a distinct symbol for its currency, the rupee.

57919,"Whatever the inconsistencies in Moscow's own policies, it has highlighted the deficiencies in Washington's approach - not least the collapse of its ailing ""train and equip"" programme for Syria, which was largely going nowhere.
Washington badly needs a new approach. US prestige in the region is at a low point.
Most of its allies are in one way or another negotiating with Moscow, and the clear message is that any new diplomatic path will run through the Russian capital rather than Washington.
Moscow's air strikes have overwhelmingly targeted non-Islamic State (IS) groups and to that extent have actually assisted the so-called IS.
Indicative of the ailing US policy is that the frequency of US air strikes against IS targets in Syria has slowed significantly since the Russian air campaign began in early September.
So US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter's appearance before the influential Senate Armed Services Committee provided an opportunity for the Obama administration to set out a new policy, to reflect the changing dynamics in the region.
What he delivered, though, was far from new - and his comments raise all sorts of questions about the scale and scope of any future US military involvement.
Two things should be clear from the outset.
The US can no more than Russia resolve the twin crises in Syria and Iraq from the outside.
That depends upon key regional actors and probably most of all upon the various factions engaged on the ground.
Secondly, the Obama administration is deeply conflicted on intervention in the Middle East.
After all - in the wake of Afghanistan and Iraq - US President Barack Obama cast his foreign policy as one that would withdraw US troops from foreign wars, not engage in new ones.
That policy has had to be modified in the light of the circumstances in Afghanistan.
And we are now seeing the start of the equivalent adjustment for Iraq and Syria.
Before the committee, the US Defence Secretary spoke of a policy guided by what he called the ""three Rs"", namely ""Raqqa, Ramadi and raids"".
Much of this remains highly tentative and subject to the same limitations US policy has suffered from the outset - apart from the Kurds, the US lacks effective allies on the ground.
Furthermore, many of the anti-IS forces also opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad are either linked to al-Qaeda or more heavily influenced by Turkey or the Gulf States rather than by Washington.
Then there is the question of how much additional military force the US itself is willing to bring to bear.
There is talk of deploying a small number of Apache attack helicopters to Iraq.
That could involve hundreds of extra US personnel.
The question of deploying forward air controllers to maximise the air campaign's impact is also being raised again.
And the new ""raiding"" policy similarly has many uncertainties.
The mission last week that freed dozens of IS-held prisoners cost the life of one US serviceman, and the Pentagon has been far from clear as to the precise role of US forces in that mission.
A more active policy could well lead to further US casualties, with perhaps only limited tactical results.
Why is there a war in Syria?
Anti-government protests developed into a civil war that, four years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, Islamic State, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory.
Who is fighting whom?
Government forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and al-Nusra Front, as well as less numerous so-called ""moderate"" rebel groups, who are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other.
What is the human cost?
More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed and a million injured. Some 11 million others have been forced from their homes, of whom four million have fled abroad - including growing numbers who are making the dangerous journey to Europe.
How has the world reacted?
Iran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the more moderate Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran are believed to have troops and officers on the ground, while a Western-led coalition and Russia are carrying out air strikes.

A Palestinian man has been accused of an horrific act of animal cruelty after posting a picture on Facebook apparently showing him torturing a mouse that he claims ate his wages. The picture, posted by a Facebook user from Gaza, shows the mouse suspended by its legs with rope from a ladder. It has been claimed that the man was punishing the mouse for destroying two bank notes worth 200 Israeli Shekels (around £35) that were in his closet. Cruel: A picture posted by a Palestinian man on Facebook appears to show a mouse being tortured after it ate his wages . The man said that he had just been handed his weekly wage and hid it in the cupboard for safe keeping. But many people are claiming that the picture and the Palestinian man's story is a fake and that it appeared on several other websites as a joke earlier in the year. Nevertheless the image provoked a strong reaction when it was picked up by the Gulf News website, with most readers appalled at the man's actions. One reader from the United Arab Emirates posted on the site: 'As desperate as the man must be to lose his money, torturing a helpless animal is not a good thing to do and not a solution. 'Another mouse may come and what will he do then? Repeat this stupid act!?!' Fake? The man also posted a picture of the two notes that he claims were destroyed by the mouse . But some questioned the outraged response of others claiming that people were more concerned about the mouse's fate than the plight of the Palestinian people. Similar actions landed a London teenager in hot water earlier this year. Andre Yankey, then 19, was spared jail by magistrates in July after making a homemade film showing him butchering a mouse. Yankey called himself a 'mouse killer' as he used a power tool to slice the rodent open and drill into its eye. The personal trainer said on camera the mouse would be 'terminated with The Blade of Doom' as he tortured and eventually killed it. But he was arrested when he sent the footage to a friend who was so disturbed by what she saw that she called the RSPCA. He was given a 12 week prison sentence suspended for 12 months and a two-year ban from owning animals.",The picture was posted by a Facebook user from Gaza.

23797,"A former star pupil at one of the country’s leading state grammars faced a backlash yesterday after claiming the school is rife with racism, sexism and homophobia. Matt Broomfield, who is now studying English at Oxford, claimed pupils at Adams’ Grammar in Newport, Shropshire, made monkey noises at him when he dated a black girl. In an extraordinary online post, he also said a culture of ‘superiority’ was drilled into pupils and that girls were treated as having ‘secondary value’ and were regularly ‘groped, bullied and harassed’. As well as bringing him academic success, he said the school ‘taught him to hate’. But his scathing remarks prompted a backlash among pupils and alumni who challenged his view of the 358-year-old school, which is all-boys until the sixth-form and allows some pupils to board for £10,230 a year. Supporters of the school included old boy and Blue Peter presenter Radzi Chinyanganya who said he ‘only had positive things to say’ about his time there. Comments posted online described the claims as ‘exaggerated’ or accused Mr Broomfield, who achieved the school’s highest GCSE results with 11 A*s in 2010, of blaming the school for the ‘pathetic opinions he held as a teenager’. The school itself has refuted the claims and said it was ‘saddened’ by the article, written for online student newspaper the Tab. I dated a black girl when I was 17. When my school friends found out, some of them laughed openly in my face… They made monkey noises . When one of the three black guys in my year walked into a room, people would sometimes hide their possessions as a joke, because ‘all ******s are thieves’ If [a friend who has since come out as gay] had gone public with this information at school, he would have been laughed at and ostracised. At Adams’, they were a source of derision and disgust . Girls were generally treated as objects, to be called ‘fat’ and ‘ugly’ and ‘stupid’. They were of secondary value . Adams’ drilled into us that the strong were always superior to the weak . The post appears to have divided opinion, with some ex-pupils backing elements of Mr Broomfield’s assertions about the school’s culture. Former pupil Mr Chinyanganya said: ‘I was at the school for seven years and it was the best seven years of my life – and I only have positive things to say about the school.’ However, Billy McClure, also a former pupil, said he took the article ‘as a personal attack on me, my friends and the best seven years of my life.' He said he could ‘wholeheartedly say I never once saw an act of homophobia or racism.' But he added: ‘First off, the school does have a problem with lad culture. Looking back, my participation doesn’t fill me with much pride. At times I was more concerned with binge drinking, showing off and objectifying women than I was about my grades. ‘I’m also ashamed to admit that we were undeniably sexist. This isn’t just an Adams or a grammar school problem but a nationwide issue. A lot of our teachers were women and they certainly didn’t approve of chauvinistic behaviour.’ In response to the article the school, which has more than 860 pupils, said in a statement: ‘We disagree wholeheartedly with the view that Adams’ supports racism, sexism and homophobia. ‘In fact, precisely the opposite is the case: we make every effort to educate our pupils to be tolerant and respectful of diversity, and to counter prejudices that are, sadly, still all too common in the world outside school.’","Matt Broomfield said girls were treated as having 'secondary value' and 'groped, bullied and harassed' In an online post, he claimed pupils made monkey noises at him when he dated a black girl at Adams' Grammar in Newport, Shropshire.

The touchdown was a spectacular and breathtaking end to a game pitting Seattle's top-ranked defence against the NFL's No 1 scoring offence led by quarterback Aaron Rodgers. The contest had taken on a funeral atmosphere for much of the game as Seattle's Super Bowl reign appeared headed to an end. But Wilson, who had misfired most of the day throwing four interceptions, flashed his champion's pedigree when it mattered most, leading a fourth-quarter rally and engineering what is already being hailed as one of the greatest post-season comebacks in NFL history. Rodgers, playing with an injured calf, removed any doubts about his fitness, dissecting the Seahawks vaunted defense as the Packers dominated the opening half and stormed to a 16-0 lead to silence the famously raucous Seattle crowd known as the 12th man.

Among other documents released this week, prosecutors have also shared a bizarre love letter Sharyn Hakken sent to a 26-year-old woman whom she met in prison, in which she tells the former inmate she is '100% committed to you and our relationship'. The Hakkens were charged with kidnapping, interference with child custody and neglect in April after they allegedly kidnapped two-year-old Chase and four-year-old Cole from the boys' grandparents, who had been granted custody of them just a week earlier.

9566,"By . Claire Ellicott . PUBLISHED: . 13:02 EST, 19 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:42 EST, 19 April 2012 . A young couple who were in effect tried and cleared twice of shaking their baby son to death called last night for an inquiry into their ‘agonising’ treatment at the hands of social services, the NHS and the police. Rohan Wray and Chana Al-Alas were accused of killing four-month-old Jayden, who died of severe head  injuries. While awaiting trial, they lost custody of the little boy’s younger  sister, Jayda. They were cleared of all criminal charges when it emerged their son had been suffering from rickets which causes weak bones and could explain his injuries. Success: Chana Al-Alas and Rohan Wray (pictured) have won a High Court battle to prove their innocence over the death of their baby son . Charges of murder and causing or allowing Jayden's (pictured) death were dropped following a six-week trial . However, their local council refused to return Jayda to her parents because it remained convinced they may have been responsible for her brother’s death. The couple then endured a four-week hearing at the High Court during which the same accusations were levelled at them. Yesterday, in a landmark judgment, they were cleared for a second time, and later they spoke bitterly of their treatment. Mr Wray, 22, said: ‘There are medical staff who we believe should be disciplined at an inquiry. I think these medical experts who judge parents are dangerous people. They base much of what they say on opinion rather than fact.’ His partner Miss Al-Alas, 19, added: ‘The doctors and the police made allegations against us without any real proof, then they acted on these allegations.’ Their nightmare began in July 2009 when Jayden, their first child, began suffering seizures and refusing to feed. Doctors failed to identify that he had rickets and his condition continued to deteriorate. He died at Great Ormond Street hospital in London. After he was found to have multiple fractures and severe brain damage, his parents, from Islington, North London, were charged with murder and causing or allowing Jayden’s death. Jayda was born in October 2010 and was immediately taken from the couple. In December 2011 an Old Bailey judge ordered not guilty verdicts to be returned because there was insufficient evidence to convict after more than 60 prosecution and defence medical experts had failed to agree on a cause of death. The court heard that Miss Al-Alas suffered from a severe vitamin D deficiency that would have been passed to Jayden, causing injuries that led to his death. 'A very much wanted baby': Chana cuddles Jayden when he was two months old . But Islington Council remained concerned for Jayda’s safety  and, because the couple had not been acquitted by a jury, chose to stage in effect a re-run of the criminal case. Handing down her judgment yesterday, Mrs Justice Theis paid tribute to Jayden’s parents, saying: ‘Despite the parents’ youth and the fact the pregnancy was unplanned, Jayden was very much a wanted baby.’ Sitting at the High Court’s family division in London, she said the case against the pair was not proved and called for more research into vitamin D deficiency and its effects on young children. She said: ‘The issues surrounding vitamin D deficiency have dominated this hearing. ‘Evidence has been given that it is on the increase, leading possibly to an increase in congenital rickets. ‘The identification of it is not easily done, as this case so graphically demonstrated.’ The disease, which was discovered at Jayden’s post mortem, weakens the skulls of children and causes their bones to break easily – symptoms which closely  mimic those of a deliberately shaken baby. Mr Wray said: ‘We feel we were treated very poorly by the state authorities involved in investigating our case. We were viewed as guilty from the outset. ‘They went down the line that we had done this to our son by shaking him. ‘If the doctors had found the rickets problem, we feel our son could still be alive today. But our agony at losing Jayden was exacerbated when we were accused of killing him.’ Police refused to let the couple or their family attend Jayden’s christening, which they requested before his life support machine was switched off. Victory after agony: Rohan and Chana pose after their High Court victory . They were not allowed into the paediatric intensive care ward to see him when he died. But the parents said the most heartbreaking moment of their ordeal was when their newborn daughter was taken from them. Mr . Wray said: ‘Since the Baby P tragedy social workers, the police and . doctors have become over-keen to snatch children from innocent parents. ‘We feel that they should look more closely at the facts of each case before pointing the finger of blame.’ Ann Thompson of law firm Goodman Ray, representing Miss Al-Alas, said: ‘Nothing is as sad as the death of a child. ‘But for these parents, the nightmare went on and on. ‘It was compounded by the criminal investigation and then the loss of their daughter without being able to bond with her. ‘They are delighted and relieved that they can finally be allowed to grieve for their son and be reunited with their daughter.’ Islington Council declined  to comment.","Rohan Wray and Chana Al-Alas were accused of killing four-month-old Jayden, who died of severe head injuries.

86832,"Injury-plagued Sturridge, 26, has been out with a hamstring problem since early December and will not feature against Sunderland on Saturday.
""Daniel has been back in training two days and that is great, so everything looks good in this moment,"" said Klopp.
""What Daniel needs, what each player needs, is consistent training, training, training.""
Sturridge has played just six games for Liverpool this term, having been ruled out by injuries to his knee and foot as well as his hamstring.
The England international missed the end of last season and all of pre-season with a hip problem and has been unfit for more days of his Reds career than he has been available for.
""Obviously there were a few problems in the past with a few injuries, not just since I was here, and that is part of the truth, but this is the past and it would be cool if we could leave it there and we can start from now on,"" said Klopp.
""We tried everything we could to bring him to this shape and now we are in the moment when hopefully we can get the benefit of this work.""
Striker Divock Origi and midfielder Philippe Coutinho also returned to training with Sturridge this week, and all three could feature in Tuesday's FA Cup fourth-round replay with West Ham.
""Divock, Phil and Daniel are in training and you think after five minutes we should put them in the squad?"" said Klopp, whose side are eighth in the Premier League.
""That is the moment when you have to say 'Come on, we have to have another three sessions which we can use and maybe be available for West Ham.""
At Friday's media conference, Klopp faced questions about Sturridge's future following reports that the former Chelsea and Manchester City forward is considering leaving Anfield.
""If someone wants to ask me something about what they have heard about, then they can ask me, but not 'suggestions' - I am not interested in this,"" the German said.
""The Daniel story is not a story. How can it be a story? You cannot create stories and then ask me.
""If someone wants to say something, at least write your name under it and don't suggest something that is not too cool. There is absolutely nothing to say about it. I have heard nothing.""
However, former Chelsea, Blackburn Rovers and Norwich striker Chris Sutton said he would not be surprised if the forward wanted to leave Anfield and pointed to Klopp's frustration with the player.
In November, the German said Sturridge had to learn ""what is serious pain and what is only pain"" after another injury setback had ruled him out of a Europa League game shortly before kick-off.
And Sutton told BBC Radio 5 live: ""I think there's something in it. Go back to November and Klopp was questioning his mentality. In football terms, people would say that Daniel Sturridge has a heart the size of a pea.
""When your manager is questioning you - and managers are careful with what they say - Klopp is frustrated with him.
""I'm not disputing his talent, he's a world-class player, but can you trust him?""","Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says Daniel Sturridge's recovery from a knee injury is ""great"" and that he will be back in training on Monday."

Field trip tragedy: Erick Ortiz drowned while visiting a recreation park on a school trip . Erick Ortiz was pulled from the deep end of the pool at Atlantic Park by lifeguards on Wednesday afternoon. The Garfield High School student was taken to hospital but pronounced dead a short time later. Witnesses say the victim's mother rushed to his side as lifeguards performed CPR on the boy. 'I . heard screaming and I knew it was the mother because she was screaming . for her son. Why, why did this happen to her son? Who wasn't watching . him?' witness Ana Serrano told NBC. Students were swimming at Atlantic Avenue Park. The small park has gardens and a 50-meter, six-lane swimming pool. 'I saw teachers running toward the boy to see what was wrong and the lifeguard began CPR,' Serrano told NBC. Investigators are unsure if Ortiz jumped into the water or was pushed. Leslie Ortiz, Erick Ortiz's sister, told NBC that her brother had no intention of going in the water. '(Erick) went in with all of his clothes on, you know with his shoes on, this is . not (how) somebody that’s prepared to go swimming goes into the pool, . right? she told NBC. She said her brother had a teaching assistant who was assigned exclusively to his care.'That was his one job, to watch him. Where was he? My brother couldn’t even go to the bathroom alone, the assistant had to go with him,' Leslie Ortiz said. Answers: The Ortiz family wants to know how Erick Ortiz came to be in the water fully clothed and why no one was watching over him . It's not clear where Ortiz's mother was at the time her son went into the water, but Leslie Ortiz says that the teaching assistant phoned the mother to tell her they were attempting to revive her son. 'He went down toward the bottom of the pool, surfaced back up. Appeared to take a breath and then sank back down toward the bottom,' Lieutenant Eddie Hernandez of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department told NBC. Attorney Luis Carrillo is representing the family, who want answers as to how Ortiz drowned and why his teaching assistant wasn't watching him.

13522,"The Scotland striker scored 40 goals last season but has found himself behind Dembele in the pecking order this term under Brendan Rodgers.
However, his goal in Saturday's 2-1 win over Dundee was his third in three games and 12th of the season.
""I'm in the team right now and it's up to Moussa to shift me,"" Griffiths said.
The pair played together in the midweek 1-0 victory over Hamilton Academical, Griffiths scoring the only goal of the game.
But Rodgers has made it clear his preferred system does not include Dembele and Griffiths together as a strike partnership.
The former Hibs man is hopeful his rich vein of form will see him hold on to his place in the starting eleven.
""That is why I am here, to score goals,"" he said.
""The gaffer shook things up during the week and resorted back to his usual formation today. The gaffer likes to keep chopping and changing. We can adapt to whatever formation he wants to play. We as players just need to take that on board.
""I am feeling good. Every time I step on the park I am confident of scoring goals.""
Griffiths admits his ""overall play can improve at times"", a point emphasised after the match by Rodgers, who offered no guarantees that the in-form striker will start against Partick Thistle on Tuesday.
""I'll pick what I think is the best team, whether it's Moussa, whether it's Leigh, whether it's none of them and we need to go with a different structure,"" the former Liverpool manager explained.
""He scored a great free-kick. He needs to be better in his lay-off, giving the ball away a bit too much in the build-up play when we're constructing the game.
""That's an area of his game that he needs to improve on, but he has so many other great qualities. He's a finisher, he's a natural goal-scorer which is very, very important for us.""","Moussa Dembele's goal against Dundee was the only goal of the game for Moussa Griffiths, who has been in fine form this season."

65325,"Even before World War Two had ended, Washington was musing on how a victorious but exhausted Britain would adjust to a world where it had less power and influence.
The US Secretary of State Edward Stettinius wrote to President Roosevelt and said: ""Never underestimate the difficulty an Englishman faces in adjusting to a secondary role after so long seeing leadership as a national right.""
The Americans were uncertain of how Winston Churchill saw the post-War world and Britain's place in it.
In 1944, just before the Normandy landings, he had turned to General de Gaulle of France and told him: ""Every time Britain has to decide between Europe and the open sea, it is always the open sea we will chose.""
In 1946, during his famous speech in Fulton, Missouri, Churchill said: ""Let no man underrate the abiding power of the British Empire and Commonwealth.""
But, during the same period, Churchill was telling an audience in Zurich: ""We must create the European family in a regional structure, called, it may be the United States of Europe.""
What was far less clear was whether he intended Britain to be part of this new structure.
The US and Britain had been the closest of allies - but, after the War, Washington, indisputably, had become the indispensable nation.
Sometimes - as over the partition of Palestine - British objections were simply ignored.
By 1952, the White House was becoming increasingly frustrated at what it saw as British attempts to undermine the emerging rapprochement between France and Germany.
Washington no longer saw Britain as a world power.
It wanted London (and Paris) to relinquish their former colonies to avoid the Soviet Union increasing its influence through support of liberation movements.
All of this came to a head with the Suez crisis, which would mark the end of Britain's imperial influence.
France and Britain acted independently of Washington and sent troops to seize the Suez canal, which the British Prime Minister, Anthony Eden, had spoken of as Britain's ""great imperial lifeline"".
The US was not informed of the military operation.
President Eisenhower used the crisis to demonstrate how power had shifted in the post-War world.
He refused to allow the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) to grant Britain emergency loans unless it called off the invasion.
Britain, militarily, never acted again against the explicit wishes of Washington.
Increasingly, it saw its influence in the world as dependent on a special relationship with the United States.
France drew a different lesson - that Europe needed to become a power in itself.
By the early 1960s, the British Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, was still agonising over where Britain's interests lay.
""Shall we be caught,"" he asked, ""between a hostile (or at least less friendly) America and a boastful but powerful empire of Charlemagne, now under French but later bound to come under German control.""
But the US establishment was sure, even back then, that Britain's place was in Europe.
In 1962, the former US Secretary of State Dean Acheson told an audience at West Point that Great Britain ""had lost an empire and has not yet found a role"".
That observation stung the British establishment, but Acheson was determined to strip away any illusions, adding: ""The attempt to play a separate power role - that is, a role apart from Europe, a role based on a special relationship with the US, a role based on being head of a 'Commonwealth' which has no political structure, or unity, or strength - that role is about played out.""
For most of the period since then, Washington has wanted the UK to be a cornerstone of the Atlantic Alliance, rooted in European institutions.
Where the UK was different to its European neighbours was in intelligence sharing with the US.
That remains the case today and, indeed, is a ""special"" relationship.
There were always strains, however. During the 1960s, Harold Wilson came under enormous pressure to send British troops to Vietnam. He refused.
After one call, he said: ""Lyndon Johnson is begging me even to send a bagpipe band to Vietnam."" Wilson stayed out of the Vietnam conflict, at least overtly.
Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan were political soulmates. They rode horses together, shared golf buggies and paraded their friendship.
""Your problems,"" said the British prime minister, ""will be as our problems, and when you look for friends we shall be there.""
But that didn't stop her publicly berating the US president over the invasion of Grenada.
Tony Blair was an American-style politician who sought a close embrace from Washington. President Clinton was invited to a Labour Party conference in Blackpool.
In 2003, despite having developed warmer relations with Brussels, he broke with France and Germany and supported President George W Bush over the invasion of Iraq.
In New York, the papers depicted Europeans who didn't support the invasion as weasels.
In that period, President Bush said: ""The United States has no truer friend than Great Britain.""
Under the Bush administration, Britain was praised for its independence, its willingness to stand up to big challenges.
But Iraq descended into chaos and no weapons of mass destruction were found.
Blair, at home, was called ""America's poodle"". In Britain, the desirability of the special relationship cooled.
In Europe, they feted the arrival of Barack Obama. I watched 200,000 people turn out to welcome him in Berlin even before he had been nominated.
The Europeans embraced a leader committed to international institutions and the use of force as a last resort.
In 2008, I asked Mr Obama about the special relationship. He said he believed in it, but I sensed the question irritated him.
He did not want to be bound by such concepts. The US's interests tilted towards the Pacific - Europe was no longer the centre of American foreign policy.
And when there were crises - such as the problems with the euro and Russian aggression in Ukraine - it was German Chancellor Angela Merkel who got the first call.
President Obama might have accepted the US was the indispensable nation, but he has been reticent with the use of US power and frustrated at the failure of Europeans to share the load.
We now know he was deeply frustrated with the Europeans and David Cameron that they did not follow through the Libyan operation to remove Col Gaddafi.
President Obama is quoted as saying Mr Cameron had become ""distracted"".
The US president used all the muscle of his office to insist UK defence spending did not fall below 2% of gross domestic product (GDP).
He is not alone in the US political establishment in venting his frustration that Europeans are ""free-riders"". They crave influence in the world but through soft power. Hard power is left to the Americans.
Mr Obama, like presidents before him, wants Europeans to take more responsibility for their neighbourhood. That means higher defence spending and closer European cooperation.
That is where American interests coincide with David Cameron's referendum campaign to remain in the EU.
Even if President Obama does not tell the British people how to vote, his visit is one of the more unusual interventions by an American president during the past 60 years.
Washington believes Britain outside the EU would weaken the Atlantic Alliance and is prepared to say so.
And the US trade representative Michael Froman has made it quite clear Washington would have no interest in pursuing a separate free-trade deal if Britain left the EU.
It would face the same tariffs and barriers as other countries outside the EU - such as China, Brazil or India.
US officials, of course, say they are acting in their own interest.
They believe a British exit would damage the global economy and weaken Europe during a turbulent period.
But the US is also sending the same message it sent after the War - although Britain is one of its closest allies with a far-reaching intelligence relationship, it sees its place in the world as part of the European project.","The US president, Franklin D Roosevelt, was a man of great political ambition, but he was also a man of great political ambition."

79728,"A crew of New York City strippers scammed wealthy men out of at least $200,000 by spiking their drinks and then dragging them to strip clubs to rack up enormous charges on their credit cards, authorities said on Wednesday. A banker, a lawyer. a doctor and a real estate attorney were among the four unidentified victims plied with ecstasy, cocaine and prescription drugs and then taken to Scores in Manhattan and the RoadhHouse NYC Gentleman’s Club in Queens. Once there the women would whisk the intoxicated men away for private dances and then take away their credit cards while they were too wasted to stop it. Drug Enforcement Administration and New York Police Department investigators arrested four women, Samantha Barbash, Roselyn Keo, Karina Pacsucci and Marsi Rosen earlier this week on charges including grand larceny, assault and forgery. Busted: Samantha Barbash, is escorted by law enforcement officers following her arrest in New York. Barbash is allegedly part of a crew of New York City strippers who scammed wealthy men by drugging them and running up extravagant bills at topless clubs while they were in a daze . Charged: Karina Pascucci arrives in court on Tuesday night after being charged in connection with a scam involving exotic dancers in New York City . Carmine Vitolo, a manager at the Roadhouse was also charged with conspiracy, grand larceny and tampering with physical evidence. One of the women was expected to appear in state court in Manhattan on Wednesday following appearances on Tuesday by the other three women. According to court papers, the strippers would prowl bars in Manhattan and Long Island for their victims over a four month period beginning in September 2013. The roundup followed an undercover investigation that found that the women joined in a scheme to rip off the men by drugging them with Molly, a powerful powder form of ecstasy after arranging to meet them on 'dates'. According to court papers, Samantha Barbash was the ring-leader along with Roselyn Keo. Barbash’s attorney, Stephen Murphy, said Wednesday that his client denies the charges. Drug allegations: Samantha Barbash led the extortion ring and threatened to blackmail some of her clients with photographs of them in compromising sexual positions from the night before . Ruthless: Samantha Barbash is allegedly the leader of a gang of strippers who have stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars from wealthy male clients in New York City . Destination: This is Scores gentlemen's club in Manhattan - one of the destination for the women after they allegedly drugged their victims . Lead: Barbash (pictured left and right) and Keo headed up the credit scam according to court papers . Once they had given their victims the drugs the women then took the men to the clubs and brought the inebriated men to private rooms for dances and then stole their cards and racked up huge charges. The strippers falsely authorized tens of thousands of dollars to the victims' cards by forging their signatures and making them believe they were being charged for a lower amount. 'These individuals targeted and isolated victims in order to illegally obtain access to their credit cards and thousands of dollars of credit,' said Police Commissioner Bill Bratton. 'Thanks to the hard work of the investigators and prosecutors in this case, these individuals will no longer be in a position to profit from this type of fraudulent activity.' The clubs paid the women for the visits, but the establishments were not facing criminal charges, authorities said according to The New York Post. The men reported waking up in their cars or in hotel rooms with little or no memory of the encounters. Those who tried to dispute the strip club bills received texts from the strippers threatening to go public with their transgressions, authorities said. 'The defendants were banking on the victims being too afraid to contact the police,' said Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan to The New York Daily News. 'They made a serious miscalculation.' Also charged: Marsi Rosen is also charged with being part of a crime ring of strippers who have allegedly stolen at least $200,000 from wealthy New York City men . Club: Karina Pascucci has been charged with assault and theft along with her three other stripper accomplices revealed court documents from Manhattan on Tuesday . Exotic: This is the RoadHouse Gentlemen's Club in Queens - another favorite destination of the strippers . Indeed, in some cases the strippers took photos and videoed the men in compromising sexual positions with women and men and threatened to blackmail them. Dr. Zyad Younan is allegedly one of the four men scammed out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by a gang of New York strippers . Last month, Scores sued a cardiologist, saying he owed the club $135,303 for unpaid services. According to the lawsuit, the doctor disputed the charges by saying 'he was drugged by plaintiff's employees and thus did not authorize the charges'— a claim the club says is contradicted by security video showing him freely showing up there on four separate occasions. A source identified this man as Zyad Younan, a cardiologist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital. According to The New York Daily News, Younan, denied he willingly authorized the $135,303 of charges. 'Today’s . indictment exposes a pattern of fraud that contributed to erroneous . media reports,' said Michael Weinstein, attorney of one of the alleged . victims. 'We were always confident that law enforcement’s . efforts would expose that my client was preyed upon by this ring and not . responsible for charges to his credit card.' The three other unidentified victims were all allegedly conned for a total of $55,000. Special . Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan said the scam 'involved not only . the theft of $200,000, but compromised the health, safety and security . of victims by covertly giving them harmful substances.'

82098,"President Barack Obama's spokesman criticized the Egyptian government on Tuesday for arresting and harassing journalists and rights activists, and called comments by Vice President Omar Suleiman that Egypt is not ready for democracy ""particularly unhelpful."" The remarks by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs reflected a growing U.S. dissatisfaction with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Suleiman, the intelligence officer Mubarak chose as his deputy to bring about reforms demanded by protesters who have convulsed Cairo and the Egyptian economy for more than two weeks. In another sign of U.S. frustration with the pace of reform in Egypt, Vice President Joe Biden, in a phone call Tuesday with Suleiman, pushed for more progress, according to a White House statement. Biden urged ""that the transition produce immediate, irreversible progress that responds to the aspirations of the Egyptian people,"" according to the White House statement. It said the two vice presidents discussed ""restraining the Ministry of Interior's conduct by immediately ending the arrests, harassment, beating and detention of journalists, and political and civil society activists, and by allowing freedom of assembly and expression; immediately rescinding the emergency law; broadening participation in the national dialogue to include a wide range of opposition members; and inviting the opposition as a partner in jointly developing a road map and timetable for transition."" ""These steps, and a clear policy of no reprisals, are what the broad opposition is calling for and what the government is saying it is prepared to accept,"" the statement said. ""Vice President Biden expressed the belief that the demands of the broad opposition can be met through meaningful negotiations with the government."" A senior administration official told CNN on condition of not being identified that the Egyptian government was ""doing the kinds of things that need to be done, but they have to now deliver and Biden outlined some specific things that will demonstrate that they're delivering."" The essential question, according to the official, was whether Egyptian leaders were ""truly willing to cede power to somebody else."" ""Are they truly going to deliver change or are they trying to put a veneer on this process and finesse the next few months without actually delivering change?"" the official added. ""There's a sense that the government can wait out the protesters. But then what? We're confident the protesters are not going away."" The Egyptian government's dilemma is ""that the longer this goes on, there's an economic impact that Egypt can't afford,"" the official said. So far, the Obama administration has been careful to call for democratic reforms in Egypt while also trying to maintain stability in a key Middle Eastern ally that is a vital Arab partner to Israel through the Camp David Accords of 1978. With detentions, beatings and harassment of journalists and rights activists continuing, and the weekend comments by Suleiman that signaled a shaky commitment to the reforms offered by Mubarak, Gibbs made a point of directly criticizing both the vice president and the Egyptian government in a briefing with White House reporters. ""The government has got to stop arresting protesters and journalists, harassment, beatings, detentions of reporters, of activists, of those involved in civil society,"" Gibbs said. Previously, he and other U.S. officials, including Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, called for a halt to the crackdown on journalists and activists without directly saying that the Egyptian government was responsible. Asked about Suleiman's comment, made in an interview with ABC, that Egypt lacks the necessary ""culture of democracy"" for the changes demanded by protesters, such as freedom of speech and the right to organize opposition parties, Gibbs said the words went against what was happening on the streets of Cairo and elsewhere in Egypt. ""Vice President Suleiman made some particularly unhelpful comments about Egypt not being ready for democracy,"" Gibbs said, adding, ""I don't think that in any way squares with what those seeking greater opportunity and freedom think is a timetable for progress."" Gibbs also took exception to Suleiman's insistence that foreign elements, including Islamists, are behind or motivating the protesters in Egypt. ""I think the rhetoric that we see coming out now that simply says that somehow what you see on TV has been drummed up by foreigners is at great odds with what we know is actually happening,"" Gibbs said. Another senior administration official, speaking with CNN on condition of not being identified because of the sensitivity of a rapidly changing political situation in Cairo, acknowledged that ""there is some sort of level of frustration here."" ""We don't want just talking,"" the official said. ""We want it to lead to something concrete."" While there is no U.S. timetable of steps being pushed, the official said, ""we continue to stress to both sides that negotiations and dialogue have to be inclusive and broad because we do recognize that there's not just three or four viewpoints; it encompasses a wide range of views in society ... that need to be fully represented in negotiations and discussions."" Gibbs repeated the U.S. call for an orderly transition in Egypt from the repressive rule of the past three decades under Mubarak to a multiparty democracy through free and fair elections. Mubarak has insisted he will remain in power through the end of his term in September instead of ceding to demands for his immediate ouster by the protesters and opposition figures. Suleiman also says Mubarak must remain in power until the next election for the transition to be orderly. Suleiman met Sunday with some Egyptian opposition figures in preliminary talks that symbolized concession on both sides. Some opposition figures had rejected any discussions until Mubarak stepped down, while a government statement issued on state TV after Sunday's meeting outlined future steps resulting from the meeting. In a brief informal exchange with reporters on Monday, Obama said: ""Obviously Egypt has to negotiate a path and I think they are making progress."" Gibbs said Tuesday that the talk of reform must be followed by meaningful action, or the protests on the streets would continue. ""I think that the people that are expressing their desire for greater opportunity and freedom are going to continue to express that desire until the government takes the very concrete steps that I outlined a minute ago to address those concerns,"" Gibbs said. ""And if they don't, then those protests will, I assume, continue."" CNN's Jill Dougherty contributed to this story.","NEW: Vice President Joe Biden urges more progress in Egypt.

Former sports teacher Keith Ruby was jailed for a series of sexual offences against a teenage boy . A top public school teacher was jailed today for 10 years after forcing a student to strip naked for 'physical tests' before subjecting him to sexual abuse. Keith Ruby, 35, inflicted years of abuse on to his teenage victim after grooming him while working as a rugby coach at a prestigious £28,000-a-year Quaker school. He subjected the boy, who was 13 when the abuse began, to intimate 'sports massages' and carried out sick 'physical tests' to ensure he was in peak condition. Ruby, who worked at Sidcot School in . Winscombe, Somerset, was arrested in 2011 when his victim, who cannot be . named for legal reasons, admitted the abuse to his horrified parents. The . teacher denied the offences but was found guilty of 16 charges of . sexual abusing the young boy over a two year period and jailed for 10 . years yesterday. Yesterday . Judge Graham Hume Jones said that Ruby was guilty of indulging his own . sexual gratification and the offences were an 'abuse of trust in the . highest measure'. He said: . 'In my judgement from the evidence you were indulging your own personal . ambition and your sexual gratification in your relationship with this . boy. 'Not only was this an . abuse of trust in the highest measure, it is not hard to imagine the . guilt felt by the complainant's parents on being duped by you.' The . court was told how Ruby forged a close relationship with the schoolboy . and his parents, and quickly became his main confidant. The coach gained the boy's trust when working at the school, and at a nearby rugby club, which the boy also attended. He . carried out sick 'physical tests' on the boy and gave him intimate . sports massages in the abuse - which did not take place on school . property. Ian Fenny, . prosecuting at Taunton Crown Court, said: 'He gained complete trust and . affection of a young, talented rugby player. He abused the relationship . for his own sexual advantage. 'As . a consequence he was able to seduce and groom the victim and that was . because he had considerable affection and loyalty towards him.' The . abuse reached its peak when the youngster, aged only 13, revealed that . he thought he was gay - it was then Ruby made his victim masturbate with . him and perform oral sex. Former teacher Keith Ruby, 35, leaves Taunton Crown Court. He has been jailed for 10 years after forcing a student to strip naked for 'physical tests' before subjecting him to horrific abuse . Sidcot School in Winscombe, Somerset, where Ruby worked. He was then arrested in 2011 . On one occasion, while on a rugby trip . to Canada, his victim awoke to find Ruby performing oral sex on him, on . another Ruby climbed into the bath with the teen and began to fondle . him. Judge Hume Jones heard how Ruby first met his victim, when he was aged only 12, after he became a pupil at Sidcot School and joined the rugby team. The talented youngster was also a member of his local rugby club where Ruby often coached. The former teacher at Sidcot School in Winscombe, Somerset, gained so much of the teenage boy's trust that he believed the actions were normal . Manipulative Ruby singled his victim out . after he began using techniques such as describing sexual matters to . evaluate his reaction and giving him 'physical tests' as a 'cloak to . mask his attraction'. The former teacher, from Biddisham, . Somerset, was even warned of his behaviour after other coaches began . getting suspicious but this . did not stop him. When his . victim admitted he was gay Ruby took his abuse to the next level, asking . the school boy if he would masturbate in front on him, with the coach . doing likewise. The . teenager complied with Ruby's requests, which also saw him perform a set act, after he was 'very much in the thrall and became highly flattered . by the attention'. My Fenny added: 'To have an adult prepared to engage in sexual actions was something he found alluding. 'There was a close bond of loyalty but this relationship was exploitative and it was wrong.' Ruby used this close bond and trust to work himself into a position of trust with the victim's family, who believed he was giving their son one-on-one sessions to further his rugby career. He denied all charges brought against him but was found guilty by a majority verdict on December 6. Ruby was handed 10 years behind bars . on the 11 counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child and five . counts of penetrative sexual activity with a child. An initial police investigation was . launched in February 2006 after allegation about the abuse came to light . but the teenager refused to co-operate, insisting nothing was going on. The investigation collapsed in July . 2006, but a fresh probe was launched in 2011 when the victim finally . admitted the abuse to his parents. Detective .

'He regularly sat at their dinner table and was welcomed into their lives as a trusted friend, teacher and coach to their son. 'His betrayal and abuse has left them completely distraught. 'In the most calculating fashion, Ruby groomed his victim to gain complete control over him. 'Such was his hold, it has taken six years for his victim to disclose the abuse he suffered at Ruby's hands. 'The sentence passed by His Honour Judge Jones today will ensure that Keith Ruby is finally behind bars for a minimum of 10 years and, as a managed sex offender for the rest of his life, will never work with children again.' During sentencing, Judge Graham Hume Jones, said: 'You abused the trust of a young boy and the trust of his parents, and you brought shame on them.' The school has said all the necessary safeguarding checks were made on Ruby. The judge said Ruby was regarded as an 'ardent and enthusiastic' sports coach who encouraged the boy in his favourite sport. He said: 'But you did this to indulge your sexual interests with this boy. In his evidence, the boy used the phrase 'hero worship' to describe his relationship with you. 'Having gained his trust you then gained the trust of his parents.' The court heard the boy's family was 'duped' by Ruby who entrusted their son into his care outside school for rugby matches and an overseas trip. He said: 'It is not hard to imagine how this boy's family feel after being duped by you. He worshipped and trusted you, and lied to the police to save your skin. 'Even then you met him again and abused him.' A spokesman from the school said: 'Our safeguarding procedures, both now and at the time of these incidents, are completely compliant and all necessary checks on the suitability of Keith Ruby to work with children were carried out by the school. 'However, unfortunately no vetting system can guarantee that every paedophile is identified.'","Keith Ruby, 35, inflicted years of abuse on to his teenage victim.

A pensioner who was accused of letting his dog foul on a public beach has been cleared by a court of any wrongdoing in just 10 minutes. The £1,000 cost of the failed dog fouling prosecution - which included a trip to the seaside - has been branded 'ridiculous'. Shih Tzu owner and respectable pensioner Bob Hewling, 71, had been accused of allowing his dog to defecate on the beach in Redcar, Cleveland. So in a bizarre move, magistrates visited the soggy beach on a wet Friday nine months after the alleged dog fouling. The visit was requested by Redcar and Cleveland Council, who were attempting to prosecute Mr Hewling for the alleged mess. The three magistrates were joined by Mr Hewling, the prosecutor, defence lawyer, court clerk and community protection officer - and the dog in question, Monty. Teesside Magistrates’ Court heard how Monty was allegedly seen 'doing his business' on Redcar beach last September. Community protection officer James Sexton told the court he was '100 per cent sure' he had seen the dog fouling the beach. Giving evidence, he told the magistrates: . 'I witnessed the faeces leaving the dog.' Denial: The pensioner, who was in an emotional and distressed state throughout the court hearing, insisted Monty had squatted as if to do his business and he had gone over with a bag . But Mr Hewling was equally adamant that his beloved pet had not fouled. The pensioner, who was in an emotional and distressed state throughout the court hearing, insisted Monty had squatted as if to do his business and he had gone over with a bag. He told the court: 'I had my bag in my hand ready to pick it up. There was nothing there at all, I am sure.' In fact the former British Steel and ICI worker said he took a dim view of dog fouling, adding: 'I don’t like it at all.' He said he always cleaned up after his dog and even after other people’s dogs. The court heard that Mr Hewling was given the opportunity to pay a fixed penalty notice but declined. He told the magistrates it was 'a matter of principle'. He said: 'If I thought Monty had done it I would have paid the fine a long time ago.' Mr Hewling, of High Street, Eston, Cleveland, has no previous convictions. His solicitor Gary Wood said the pensioner had never been in a courtroom before - apart from jury service and receiving a bravery award for rescuing a man from a river. The only time Mr Hewling had been in a police station was to hand in some lost money and World Cup tickets, said Mr Wood. Taking just 10 minutes to find him not guilty, chair of the bench Pamela Ross said they believed the officer had 'made an honest mistake'. After the case Mr Hewling said: 'I feel relieved it is all over and done with. 'It was very tempting to pay the fine but it is the principle. I knew the dog hadn’t done anything.' Wife Ann, 68, said: 'It has been really stressful for both of us. 'I haven’t been sleeping properly for the last few months, neither has my husband. 'I think it is ridiculous, it is not right. It was a waste of public money. It shouldn’t have gone as far as it did.' Mr Wood said: 'I would expect it would cost in excess of £1,000. It has taken a full day’s worth of magistrates’ time. It has proved costly.' A Redcar and Cleveland Council spokesman declined to comment on the cost of the case. He said: 'We do take the issue of dog fouling extremely seriously as it has regularly been highlighted by residents as one of their main concerns. However, on this occasion, a mistake has clearly been made and we would like to apologise for any distress that was caused.'","Shih Tzu owner Bob Hewling, 71, had been accused of allowing his dog to defecate on the beach in Redcar, Cleveland.

73595,"Phil Flanagan sued the firm AIG after it refused to cover him when he sent a tweet falsely implying Ulster Unionist MP Tom Elliott had shot people.
But a judge ruled that AIG was entitled to withhold cover because Mr Flanagan knew the remark was defamatory.
He also ordered Mr Flanagan to pay the legal costs of his failed action.
Mr Flanagan was told in February that he must pay £48,750 compensation to Mr Elliott for making the unfounded allegation about the former Ulster Unionist leader's conduct during his previous career as an Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldier.
The court heard that Mr Flanagan had tweeted about Mr Elliott when the unionist politician was being interviewed by Stephen Nolan about the Troubles.
The High Court heard that Mr Flanagan tweeted: ""I wonder if he [Mr Elliott] will reveal how many people he harassed or shot as a member of the UDR.""
The contents of his tweet were held to be baseless and grossly defamatory.
As a result of legal action, Mr Flanagan, who failed to gain re-election to the Northern Ireland Assembly last month, issued an apology on Twitter and agreed to pay compensation and costs.
He accepted his tweet was ""untrue, wholly without foundation"" and apologised ""for all offence caused"".
A High Court judge put the payout on hold until Mr Flanagan resolved his case against AIG, the insurers used by Northern Ireland Assembly members.
The court heard that the policy provided for libel and slander claims excludes cases where MLAs know their comments are defamatory.
He said it was never his intention to defame Mr Elliott, and he only realised the seriousness of the situation after taking legal advice.
Lawyers for AIG said on Wednesday that Mr Flanagan was ineligible for cover because the policy did not cover libel cases between MLAs, and that the tweet had nothing to do with constituency or parliamentary business.
The judge rejected those submissions, but he backed a contention that AIG could refuse to cover Mr Flanagan because he knew his posting was defamatory.
He also upheld a claim by AIG that Mr Flanagan took no precautions before publishing the tweet and said Mr Flanagan knew there was no evidence he could use as a defence to any libel proceedings against him.","A former Northern Ireland Assembly member has been ordered to pay £48,750 to an insurer for libel and slander after failing to win re-election."

14897,"The nine young North Koreans thought they were near the end of their long and dangerous journey toward freedom. Their years-long odyssey had taken them thousands of miles, from North Korea, one of the world's most repressive states, to Laos, a small, landlocked nation in Southeast Asia. From there, they just needed to cross the border into Thailand and find their way to South Korean diplomats who would be able to offer them citizenship and a new life. Orphaned and homeless: Surviving the streets of North Korea . But something went wrong in Laos. They were detained by the authorities. And rather than transferring the group of young refugees to South Korean officials, as the people engineering their escape were anticipating, the Laotian government this week did something unexpected. It gave them back to North Korea. ""This is a horrible, horrible thing that has happened,"" said Suzanne Scholte, the president of the Defense Forum Foundation, a U.S.-based nonprofit group that was involved in the effort to get the young North Koreans to safety. Analysis: North Korea diplomacy effort grows, but sides are still far apart . The United Nations' refugee agency, UNHCR, says Laos deported the group of North Koreans to China on Monday. And Scholte said Friday that she believes they have already been flown back to North Korea, where she fears they could face torture or even death. Human rights advocates and UNHCR have criticized the decision by Laos to deport the refugees, who are between 15 and 23 years old, noting that international law gives people the right not to be forced to return to places where they face persecution. Thousands of North Koreans have fled their country's Stalinist regime since the Korean War in the 1950s and settled in South Korea, which offers them citizenship. Most of them make their way there through China and Southeast Asia. Plucked from the streets . Until they were detained by Laotian authorities earlier this month, it appears the group of young North Koreans traced a path similar to that of many other refugees. Years ago, they slipped through the authoritarian grip of their homeland and crossed the border into China, most likely with their various parents. Opinion: What North Korea could learn from Myanmar . Scholte said that in China, one or way another, they all ended up fending for themselves on the streets, eating out of trash bins and dodging North Korean agents. She said she didn't know whether their parents had abandoned them, died or been detained and sent back to North Korea. They were plucked from that precarious existence by a South Korean man and his wife who were living in China, Scholte said, referring to the man only by the name of ""M.J."" to protect his identity. Read more: Why the Korean War still matters . M.J. and his wife took in a total of 15 young North Koreans, giving them food, shelter and protection for more than four years. To avoid getting caught, the youngsters had to remain inside at all times. ""You could liken it to a Jewish family trying to hide from the Nazis,"" Scholte said. ""They had to be invisible."" China doesn't treat North Koreans in its territory as refugees and usually sends them back across the border. Difficult journeys . In 2011, the Defense Forum Foundation began working with M.J. and his wife to try get the group of North Koreans out of China to South Korea or the United States. They managed to get the three oldest North Koreans to safety in South Korea via Thailand, Scholte said. Next, they succeeded in organizing the escape of the two youngest children and one with learning difficulties to the United States. Analysis: What's Kim Jong Un up to? Nine others remained in China. M.J. and his wife accompanied them on the quest to reach South Korea via Laos and Thailand. They reportedly entered Laos around May 10 and were detained soon after that. At the time, Laotian authorities assured M.J. and his wife, who were not being held, that there was nothing to worry about, Scholte said. ""We had no reason to believe that the Laotians were going to cut some deal with North Korea,"" she said, noting that she had helped to get four other North Koreans to the United States from Laos in 2009. But on Monday, she said, M.J. received word that the group of refugees was being taken to the North Korean Embassy. By then, it was too late to save them. ""When I got the call, I was in shock,"" Scholte said. An 'alarming case' Other organizations also were surprised by the development. Laos has been one of the main routes to a safe country for North Korean defectors, according to Eun Young Kim, a senior program officer with the Citizen's Alliance for North Korean Human Rights, a nongovernmental organization based in Seoul. ""We never officially experienced the Laotian government actually cooperating with the North Korean government and sending them back to North Korea,"" she said. ""This is a very surprising, alarming case, especially the fact that the North Korean government got involved."" Read more: Escaping from N. Korean gulag . It was unclear what prompted the decision by Laos to give the refugees to the North Koreans. Laotian government officials in the country's capital, Vientiane, declined to provide official comment on the matter when contacted by CNN on Friday. But Khantivong Somlith, an official at the Laotian Embassy in Seoul, said that the refugees had been handed over to North Korea because they didn't have visas and were therefore in Laos illegally. ""We know they are Koreans, that's why they were sent back to the North Korean Embassy,"" he said. ""That's the rule."" He said he didn't know where the refugees are now. Controversy in South Korea . South Korean officials have been criticized in their country's news media as having failed to act quickly and decisively enough to get the North Koreans out of Laos after their detention. But Scholte said that all those involved in the attempt to recover the refugees had ""underestimated"" the North Koreans' determination to get hold of them. She noted the efforts of South Korea in previous successful operations to rescue North Koreans. ""We haven't seen this before,"" she said. Interactive: Who's in range of North Korean missiles? The South Korean government has declined to discuss the specifics of this case. ""We've expressed our government's position to the relevant nation and we have also consulted on future measures,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho Tai-young said in a news briefing Thursday. After reaching a peak of nearly 3,000 in 2009, the number of North Koreans arriving in South Korea dropped to just above 1,500 in 2012, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry. Concerns over safety . International organizations, meanwhile, are raising concerns about what fate awaits the deported refugees. ""North Korea has to come clean on where these nine refugees are and publicly guarantee that they will not be harmed or retaliated against for having fled the country,"" said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of the advocacy group Human Rights Watch. ""As a result of their return they are at dire risk",Laotian government deports nine North Koreans to China.

A 3-1 win over West Ham United on Tuesday saw Arsene Wenger's team climb back into the English Premier League's top four, keeping the Gunners in contention to qualify for the lucrative European Champions League. Two goals from Germany's Lukas Podolski and a 20th of the season from Frenchman Olivier Giroud saw Arsenal leapfrog Everton in the table, after Matt Jarvis had given West Ham a shock lead in the first half. The vital victory came just three days after Arsenal had secured a place in the FA Cup final with a dramatic penalty shootout victory over second-tier Wigan Athletic. Two wins in quick succession have boosted Arsenal's hopes of reaching the Champions League for 17th consecutive season, while also keeping alive their chances of lifting silverware for the first time in nine years and relieving some of the pressure on beleaguered manager Wenger. ""I think we built the victory tonight through consistency in our game, the vital part was to come back just before half time and in the second half we controlled the game well,"" Wenger, who has been at Arsenal since 1996, told Sky. ""After Saturday's game we had to dig deep."" Everton climbed above Arsenal at the weekend, and it looked as if the north London club would lose further ground in the battle for fourth place when West Ham took the lead on 39 minutes through one-time England winger Matt Jarvis. With Arsenal fans fearing a chastening defeat, the home team responded. Just five minutes later, Spain's Santi Cazorla expertly picked out Podolski, who turned inside the penalty area and fired a fierce low drive beyond West Ham goalkeeper Adrian. Ten minutes into the second half, Arsenal hit the front when Giroud showed sublime touch to control Thomas Vermaelen's lofted pass before converting with aplomb. Podolski put the seal on a much-needed result when he lashed home on 78 minutes following a header from substitute Aaron Ramsey, who was making his first Premier League appearance after a lengthy injury layoff.

""After the FA Cup it was important we switched on to the Premier League,"" said two-goal hero Podolski. ""Everyone wants to play in the Champions League because the matches are amazing and important for the club.

Travellers cleared from Dale Farm after a lengthy legal battle have said they want to replace it with a new site more than twice the size. They want to build more than 100 new pitches on the green belt land in Crays Hill, Essex, which they say is now contaminated anyway. News of the plans comes just 15 months after Basildon Council and Essex Police spent £7.1m evicting around 80 families from the six-acre site. Covered in rubbish: Following the eviction, Dale Farm became a target for fly-tippers and is now covered in old mattresses, washing machines and rubbish . Now the council, which had promised to restore it to greenbelt land, has been consulted by a campaigner for the travellers on what has been dubbed a 'supersite' at Dale Farm. The new scheme would involve redeveloping all 51 demolished pitches and creating 20 temporary pitches along Oak Road where touring caravans are currently illegally parked. There would also be 40 upgraded neighbouring legal pitches. If approved, the site would be more than . twice the size of the illegal development which stood in the town for . more than a decade. Today Basildon Council confirmed that . Stuart Hardwicke-Carruthers, a campaigner for the travellers, had made . extensive enquiries into submitting the radical plan. A council spokesman said: 'Mr . Hardwicke-Carruthers has requested the council's opinion as to whether . an environmental impact assessment would need to be carried out prior to . the possible submission of a planning application for the proposed . development of a 111-pitch gypsy and traveller site on land he refers to . as being Dale Farm. Battlefield in the green belt: This aerial photo shows what was Europe's biggest illegal traveller site shortly after it was cleared, with the legal site next door . Popular site: Following the eviction, many travellers simply parked along the lane leading to Dale Farm . 'It should be stressed that no planning application has been submitted. 'The council has three weeks from the submission date of the request to provide its opinion. 'The consideration of this request does not affect the planning position or Green Belt status of the land.' Mr Hardwicke-Carruthers, who advises the travellers' legal team, claims that . concreting over the land and using it as traveller pitches is the only . viable option for the potentially-contaminated site. He said: 'Because the land is now . contaminated with hazardous substances, the most sensible option will be . to cap it with a concrete base and the only real potential use becomes . another traveller site. 'This . will not only deal with the environmental problems caused by the . clearance, but also meet the shortage of sites in the borough.' Tony Ball, Leader of Basildon Council, described the possible application as ‘ridiculous’. He said: 'Given the history of this site, and the number of legal challenges and decisions that have been made regarding Dale Farm, I find it ridiculous that Mr Carruthers could even consider submitting a planning application to redevelop the land. 'I, along with many local people, find it an insult that after a decade of persistent law-breaking and significant cost to the taxpayer to uphold the law, that this is even being suggested. 'He has learnt nothing from the Dale Farm issue, and this is clearly a publicity stunt that will just waste valuable council officer time. 'The site is within the green belt, and our green belt policy is clear, as is national planning policy. 'However, there is nothing the council can do to stop an individual submitting a speculative application whether they have a chance of implementing their plans or not.' Burning barricades: The eviction of Dale Farm in October 2011 involved police and council workers and cost taxpayers £7.1m . Neighbour Len Gridley, 54, whose house backs on to the illegal site, said: 'This is another ludicrous plan. 'There would be uproar if this got through and residents would make sure the whole council had to resign. 'Because of the amount of money spent on the eviction, to reinstate it would be madness.' The eviction, in October 2011, involved more than 300 police officers, as well as bailiffs and council workers, and some of the residents had to be forcibly removed. Many of the travellers who were evicted from the site in 2011 simply moved to a temporary camp 100 yards away. Basildon Council promised to turn the site back into greenbelt land, but more than a year on it appears as if nothing has been done, and fly-tipped rubbish covers the site. The results of an Environment Agency investigation into potentially dangerous pollutants - including asbestos and engine oil - allegedly dug up by council contractors during the eviction is expected within the coming weeks.

The bank said its so-called non-core divisions lost £815m.
Barclays warned last month that its first quarter would be weaker than last year due to turbulent market conditions and a ""particularly strong"" March 2015.
Barclays chief executive Jes Staley said the bank had made ""good early progress"" against its cost cutting and restructuring strategy, which it announced last month.
In March, Barclays said it would split itself into two main core divisions - Barclays UK and Barclays Corporate and International - to meet new banking regulations, which are aimed at preventing ordinary customers suffering from decisions made by investment bankers in the event of another financial crisis.
Profits at these two divisions rose 18%.
But losses at its non-core division, which contains a range of business lines including its European retail operations and some of its Asian banking operations, widened to £815m from £310m a year ago.
The bank plans to have sold off its entire non-core division by the end of next year.
Revenues at its investment bank fell 31% in the quarter, but Mr Staley, who took the helm in December, said the bank had outperformed rivals.
""We think we've picked up significant market share so we're pleased by that.
""We're not satisfied by the level of profitability we have in our corporate and investment bank, but we are encouraged by our relative performance in the first quarter,"" he said.
The bank also said last month that it would offload most of its stake in its Africa business. In its latest statement, Barclays said it was ""continuing to explore opportunities"" to reduce its share in the Africa business.
Mr Staley insisted the group's core business was performing well ""despite a challenging market environment"".

Barclays also warned it was ""cautious"" ahead of the EU referendum vote on 23 June.
It said there had been little improvement so far in the performance of its investment banking division in the second quarter, but said it was ""too early"" to  make any specific comment on its overall performance for the quarter.
Richard Hunter, head of research at Wilson King Investment Management, said the results showed ""the potential of a newly streamlined Barclays"".

Separately, Spanish banking giant Banco Santander, the eurozone's biggest bank, also reported a fall in profits on Wednesday.
The bank said profit dropped 5% to €1.6bn (£1.2bn) in the first three months of the year, mainly due to a fall in the Brazilian Real and sterling. The bank said excluding the impact of exchanging all its earnings into euros, its profits would have risen 8%.
Banco Santander makes about a fifth of its profit in Brazil, its second-biggest market after the UK.
Despite the profit fall, group chairman Ana Botín said the bank's performance was better-than-expected and ""gives us confidence that we will continue to deliver"".

Campaigners have called for a scheme where shoppers would pay a deposit when buying cans or bottles, which would be refunded when they return them empty.
Former environment secretary Richard Lochhead said Coca-Cola's backing was a ""significant development"".
The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland (APRS) group has led the ""Have You Got the Bottle?"" campaign, lobbying ministers to bring in a deposit scheme.
A Coca-Cola spokesman told Holyrood magazine: ""It's already clear from our conversations with experts that the time is right to trial new interventions such as a well-designed deposit scheme for drinks containers, starting in Scotland where conversations are under way.""
He added that the firm had made ""significant progress"" in recent years towards making its packaging more sustainable, and was now looking at ""ways we can collaborate with others to improve recycling rates and reduce litter"".
Campaigners hailed this as a ""truly landmark moment"", noting that the firm had previously opposed similar schemes.
SNP MSP Mr Lochhead, who examined such schemes when he was a cabinet secretary, said: ""This change of heart by the world's biggest soft drink company is a very welcome and highly significant development in the campaign to introduce deposit and return schemes for drinks containers to improve recycling and tackle litter.
""It is refreshing that such a major player in the industry is willing to change its mind after looking at how such schemes work in countries around the world.""
The Marine Conservation Society said it was ""great to see Coca-Cola recognise the advantages"" of such a scheme, while WWF Scotland said they ""very much welcome"" the move.",Soft drink giant Coca-Cola has backed a campaign to introduce deposit and return schemes for cans and bottles.

Technology can help. Take, for example, that classic Halloween accessory, the realistic festering wound. Former NASA employee Mark Rober has created an app that shows animations of moving, oozing innards. Put your iOS or Android smartphone in a special fleshy case, add a carefully bloodied, ripped T-shirt and you have the iWound. There is also a moving eyeball outfit, and a new effect that makes it look like a hand is ripping out your guts from behind. Rober first got the idea for mixing Halloween and smartphones in 2011. Using two iPads and the FaceTime video chatting app, he strapped one tablet to his front and the other to the back. The live video feed made it look like there was a hole blasted through the center of his body. One hit YouTube video later, and Rober had found his new calling. This year, he quit his job as a mechanical engineer at NASA and started Digital Dudz, a company that makes costumes that integrate tablets and smartphones.

91804,"He expects the economy to shrink by 7%, greater than the 5% forecast by the crisis-hit country's central bank.
Representatives of Greece's three international lenders have arrived in Athens in a bid to get its deficit cutting measures ""back on track"".
But, Mr Samaras criticised comments by some foreign officials for ""undermining"" Greece's national effort.
Without sufficient progress, it may not receive the final part of its bailout worth 31.5bn euros ($38bn; Â£24.5bn).
Assistance for Greece totalling 130bn euros was agreed in March, its second major rescue package, with strict conditions attached that force Greece to cut debt and spending.
A deeper recession will not help Athens improve its performance, as it is already behind in its austerity plans because its economy is shrinking faster than forecast.
Mr Samaras said the country, which has been in recession for five years, would not return to growth until 2014.
He is expected to ask for more time to repay its loans.
The Bank of Greece had been expecting GDP to shrink 5% this year, which would have been its deepest recession since the 1930s.
Economists calculate that Greece may need a third rescue package worth up to 50bn euros.
Greece's performance is being assessed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), European Central Bank (ECB) and European Commission, who together have been dubbed the troika.
The IMF said it was ""supporting Greece in overcoming its economic difficulties"" and would work with the country to get it ""back on track"".
However, reports over the weekend suggested that the IMF would refuse calls for further aid.
Meanwhile Greece is expecting another high-profile visitor this week.
The European Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, is planning his first visit to the country since 2009.
""The purpose of the meeting is to meet Mr Samaras and discuss the overall  economic situation in Europe and in particular in Greece,"" Mr Barroso's spokesman said.
He said it was ""a regular meeting"" and that the preparation for the talks had been ""under discussion for some time"".
Greece has promised to reduce its budget deficit to below 3% of annual national income as measured in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by the end of 2014. At the end of last year, Greece's overspend was equivalent to 9% of GDP in 2011.
Successive Greek governments have managed to trim 17bn euros from government spending. That has brought the country's total debt down from more than 160% of GDP to 132% according to  
          official figures
 released on Monday.
Under the terms of its international loan agreement with the troika, Greece has vowed to reduce its total debt to 120% of GDP by 2020.
But, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras would have had to have raised another 12bn euros through higher taxes and the sale of public assets such as the country's loss-making railways to have met this bailout target.
The re-run of general elections and political instability as parties scrambled to form a governing coalition has delayed work by the troika and the government to agree a credible plan to restore the nation's finances.
On Monday, a European Commission spokesman said the troika would not be in a position to report its findings and release the final 31.5bn euro instalment of bailout money until September.
""The Commission is confident that the decision on the next disbursement will be taken in the near future, although it is unlikely to happen before September,"" he said.
That leaves Greece in a difficult situation. A 3.8bn euro debt repayment to the ECB falls due on 20 August. Without the troika money, the ECB may be forced to step in to provide temporary aid.
But further debt repayments are due in September so failure to secure the bailout money could push Greece to the brink of insolvency.
If Greece were to default on its outstanding loans that, in turn, could force it to exit the eurozone and return to the drachma.",Greece's Prime Minister Antonis Samaras has called for more time to repay the country's debt and spending.
56765,"The United States and South Korea began their annual joint military exercise Monday, kicking off an 11-day drill designed to ensure the countries' alliance is ""fully prepared to respond to any potential provocations,"" according to a statement from U.S. forces in South Korea. On Monday, South Korean president Lee Myung-bak ordered his military to ""thoroughly"" prepare with the United States to counter threats from North Korea, the Yonhap news agency reported. The timing of the joint training comes during a time of increased military tensions. South Korea blamed North Korea for sinking a 1,200-ton warship in March, killing 46 sailors.

North Korea's statement Sunday took direct aim at U.S. President Barack Obama. ""The Obama Administration would be well advised to cool its head heated with the moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK,"" the spokesman for the General Staff of the Korean People's Army said, ""and deeply ponder over what the DPRK meant when it clarified its resolute determination and solemn declaration to defend the country and the nation."" In response, Pentagon Spokesman Bryan Whitman said, ""These are annual exercises that reflect the U.S. commitment to the stability and security of the peninsula."" On Sunday, Yonhap reported the South Korean president proposed a plan to reunite his country with North Korea and suggested a tax to prepare for the costs expected if the two countries come together. ""Inter-Korean relations demand a new paradigm,"" Lee said in a speech to mark the 65th anniversary of Korea's independence from Japanese colonial rule, Yonhap reported. Lee said the two countries should form a ""peace community,"" and stressed the importance of the denuclearization of North Korea, Yonhap reported. He added that inter-Korean exchanges are needed to help build North Korea's economy, according to Yonhap. ""It is imperative that the two sides choose coexistence instead of confrontation, progress instead of stagnation. The two of us need to overcome the current state of division and proceed with the goal of peaceful reunification,"" Lee said, according to Yonhap.","11-day drill designed to prepare alliance for ""potential provocations,"" U.S. says.

It appeared to be part of an effort by the to shore up faltering support in the South West, traditionally one of the party’s strongholds. The claim that it was part of yet more ‘horse-trading’ will add to growing concern among senior Tories that government is being reduced to ‘transactional’ deal-making with their coalition colleagues. Last night a Cabinet source identified Mr Laws as a significant problem for relations between the two parties. Conservative ministers did not disagree with the proposal for Cornwall, but thought it bizarre that Mr Laws apparently sought to link it to a major austerity measure. ‘You can do a deal with Danny [Alexander]. He will do what he says he’s going to do. But I have never come across a more tricky politician than David Laws,’ said the Cabinet source. ‘You wouldn’t believe the horse-trading that we have to do and how silly some of the gimmicks that they want are.’ Tory Cabinet ministers are rallying to the support of Education Secretary Michael Gove, who has been embroiled in increasingly bitter public disputes with the Lib Dems in recent weeks. Yesterday the Daily Mail revealed Mr Clegg twice suggested police should be brought in to investigate damaging leaks about his plans to extend free school meals, which he blamed on Dominic Cummings – a former senior aide to Mr Gove. Deal: The Cornish are now a minority under an EU convention, and the Cornish language receives state funding . Ministers insist problems are not limited to Mr Gove’s department, but are increasingly happening elsewhere. One example, the source said, was the Communities and Local Government Department’s bid to make vital savings in the management of town hall pensions. Ministers agreed to bring in a bank or actuarial firm to cut huge administration costs, which vary greatly across almost 90 local government retirement schemes. But the Lib Dems insisted on the Cornish announcement in exchange for agreeing to the reforms, the source claimed. The Cornish have been afforded the status of a national minority, made under a European convention. Only 557 people claim Cornish is their main language, but teaching of the dialect is receiving government funding. It emerged yesterday Mr Clegg has asked Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, to issue a formal warning to Mr Cummings about his duty of confidentiality. Mr Cummings said he was prepared to repeat his allegations against the Deputy Prime Minister ‘under oath’. He accused Mr Clegg of lying about funding of free school meals for pupils aged five, six and seven. A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘It’s in the nature of coalitions that negotiations happen and David Laws has the role of leading those talks for us every week.’","Liberal Democrat minister David Laws demanded the move in return for another policy, it is claimed. The Lib Dems are said to have refused to agree to reforms of town hall pensions."

Edmund, 21, put up a strong challenge before Murray took control in the final set.
The Scot will face Marin Cilic in the last four after the Croat beat American Steve Johnson 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-4.
""I train with Kyle, I know how good he is,"" Murray told BBC Sport.
""He's a big, strong guy with a very powerful game. When he's on he's very difficult to play in practice, and I felt it today as well. I expected it to be hard.""
Murray knows Edmund well after inviting the Englishman to join him in Miami for off-season training for the past three years, but this was their first competitive meeting.
Edmund had beaten eighth seed Gilles Simon in round one and began with a confident service game.
Find out how to get into tennis in our special guide.
His heavy serve and forehand were in evidence, as well as some flashes of skill in the forecourt, with a sharp volley helping him recover an early break.
Murray broke again on his way to clinching the first set, a spectacular lunging volley bringing the crowd alive, but the top seed twice fell a break down in the second.
Edmund's big forehand took him 4-2 ahead - after a nasty slip at the net by Murray - and the world number 85 came through a dramatic game of three break points to level at one set all.
With grey clouds gathering, Murray stepped on the accelerator in the final set.
A brilliant running forehand in the first game and some typically sharp returning helped him to a 3-0 lead, and he closed it out from 15-40 down thanks to some good serving.
""I am pleased with the way I played and overall it's been a positive week for me,"" said Edmund.
""I thought I played well but Andy is so tough to beat because he makes it so difficult for you when it really matters.""
Murray made his breakthrough in terms of public attention with a run to the last 16 at Queen's Club in 2005, when ranked 357th in the world, and he made a plea on Edmund's behalf.
""Kyle's the future of the game in this country,"" said Murray. ""It's important that he's given time to develop at his own rate and not too much pressure is put on him.
""He's doing great, he's improving every year and he's got a really good team behind him.
""If he's given time and a little bit of space to keep developing and not too much pressure on the results at this stage, he can go very far.""

31210,"The North Korean government is fuming over the release of the ""The Interview,"" claiming President Barack Obama forced the film into theaters and onto streaming video services. ""U.S. President Obama is the chief culprit who forced the Sony Pictures Entertainment to 'indiscriminately distribute' the movie and took the lead in appeasing and blackmailing cinema houses and theatres in the U.S. mainland to distribute the movie,"" North Korea's National Defense Commission said Saturday, according to state-run media. ""Obama always goes reckless in words and deeds like a monkey in a tropical forest."" In the screwball comedy, a tabloid journalist who is granted an interview with North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un is asked to assassinate him. But when he arrives, the movie version of the dictator charms him. Later on, however, the two wage battle. 'Inescapable deadly blows' Just getting ""The Interview"" into theaters and online streams has been an ordeal. Sony Pictures had initially suspended the Christmas release of the movie after its IT systems were hacked by a group called the ""Guardians of Peace,"" which had complained about the movie's pending release. The group also warned of severe attacks on movie theaters showing the film. In the cyberattack, thieves took a possible record haul of 100 terabytes of data -- a slew of movies and other content, company secrets, personal information of employees and the Social Security numbers of celebrities. The FBI has blamed North Korea for that cyberattack. North Korea, in turn, slammed the United States for the accusation. ""If the U.S. is to persistently insist that the hacking attack was made by the DPRK, the U.S. should produce evidence without fail, though belatedly,"" said the North Korean Defense Commission statement carried Saturday by the state-run Korean Central News Agency. ""If the U.S. persists in American-style arrogant, high-handed and gangster-like arbitrary practices despite the repeated warnings of the DPRK, the U.S. should bear in mind that its failed political affairs will face inescapable deadly blows."" U.S. accused over North Korean outage . Pyongyang's statement also accused the United States of being behind the crippling outage of North Korea's Internet last week. ""The U.S., a big country, started disturbing the internet operation of major media of the DPRK,"" it said. The U.S. government last week declined to say whether it was responsible for the Internet disruption in North Korea. Obama had earlier warned the United States would ""respond proportionally"" to the Sony hack. Obama had also expressed disappointment at the movie's suspension, saying free speech had been stifled. ""We cannot have a society in which some dictators someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States because if somebody is able to intimidate us out of releasing a satirical movie, imagine what they start doing once they see a documentary that they don't like or news reports that they don't like,"" Obama said last week. ""That's not who we are. That's not what America is about."" Who's behind the Sony cyberattack . The FBI has said that the code of the malware used in the attack on Sony is similar to what North Korea has used in other attacks. But that code was leaked a long time ago, cyberexperts say, and any hacker around the world could have used it. Some U.S. cyberexperts say the evidence the FBI has presented isn't enough to isolate North Korea as the culprit. ""It's clear to us, based on both forensic and other evidence we've collected, that unequivocally they are not responsible for orchestrating or initiating the attack on Sony,"" said Sam Glines, who runs cybersecurity company Norse. CNN has reached out to the FBI for comment on such doubt, but has not heard back. $1 million in one day . After Sony Pictures said film distributors had decided not to show ""The Interview"" for security reasons, Sony then arranged for direct distribution online via its own services, YouTube and through independent cinemas. A few hundred movie theaters decided to go ahead and show the film on Christmas. Sony had originally planned to release the movie in 2,000 to 3,000 theaters, but only about 300 played it. Nonetheless, the film raked in $1 million on its first day. While there were threats of attacks on theaters that showed the film, no major incidents were reported.","North Korea accuses the U.S. of forcing the release of ""The Interview"" The FBI has blamed North Korea for a cyberattack.

Chung Kim, 76, was convicted for murder on Thursday after he killed his upstairs neighbors over a dog feces dispute . A 76-year-old Dallas, Texas man was convicted of capital murder on Thursday in the shooting deaths of his neighbors last year because of a months-long feud about their dog's feces on his porch. A jury found that Chung Kim fatally shot his neighbor Michelle Jackson, 31, on February 4, as she stood on her balcony above his apartment. Kim then went upstairs to her residence and shot and killed her boyfriend, Jamie Stafford, 31. The couple's dog would relieve itself on their balcony, causing the urine and feces to drip down Kim's balcony each time they washed it, according to court records. Kim claimed the couple had 'intentionally thrown dog feces' on his porch. 'That’s all come down from my patio, from up patio. But now, three months later so stink,' he told CBS from jail. He also said that the shooting of Stafford was in self-defense but that he could not remember shooting Jackson because he suffered a blackout. Kim faces an automatic life sentence in prison without parole. Just months before their death, Jackson and Stafford had their first child together. Jackson also had four children aged 7 to 11 from a previous partner. The baby now lives with Jackson's parents and the four children live with their father in Garland, Texas. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Chung Kim says he shot Stafford out of self-defense and doesn't remember shooting Jackson . Life wasted: Jamie Stafford and partner Michelle Jackson were killed because their neighbor claims they threw dog feces on his porch . The couple lived above Kim and feces would supposedly drop onto his porch . The Dallas News reports that Kim, with the help of an interpreter, begged district Judge Balido for a new trial and entirely new lawyers. Judge Balido told Kim that she would appoint Kim a court-appointed attorney for appeals if convicted. He said he wanted to share his side of the story and claims that he was terrorized by his neighbors. Kim's defense attorney spoke on his behalf. 'They specifically came down and dumped it on his shoes and on the door,' defense attorney Kobby Warren said. CBS interviewed Kim who shared his account of the event. He says it was his neighbor who pulled a gun on him and that he shot in self-defense. He claims he used martial arts to wrestle the gun out of Stafford's hands. 'Before he pull trigger, I got him!' Kim told CBS from his jail cell. 'I hit him in his gun. And pushed his arm. And, I take his gun. And with my elbow knock him down,' he continued. He says the woman was not killed out of self-defense and claims he doesn't remember shooting her. 'I saw him. I don’t remember. At this time, My brain is gone. After this, I don’t know,' he said. 'I call, ""Hey stop. Stop. And he go up. He say wait."" And, he come back. Threw gun onto my head,' Kim said. The police affidavit describes a different account of the event. It says, around 8 o’clock Monday morning, Chung Kim shot Michelle Jackson while she was standing on her balcony. Defense attorney Koby Warren asked the jury to consider a lesser murder charge. The prosecution argued that revenge is not an acceptable impetus for murder. 'This isn’t an eviction proceeding. If that was the case, the defense would win,' prosecutor Herschel Woods said. 'There could have been time for cool reflection.' 'Because you were angry doesn’t mean you can exact a terrible punishment on someone,' he concluded. Jackson's mother, Yvonne Hypolite, read a statement after the judge read the verdict. 'The smallest baby will never know her mother,' Hypolite said. 'I don’t understand, Kim, why you killed my daughter.' 'I’m really glad he got sentenced, but it still can’t bring my daughter back,' said Hypolite.

48318,"The RSPCA should stop attempting to bring criminal prosecutions against hunts, an independent inquiry found yesterday. The charity should also rethink its longstanding role of taking animal cruelty cases to court, and help develop a new system in which it would work with Government agencies to bring offenders to book. The inquiry led by former Crown Prosecution Service chief inspector Stephen Wooler followed criticism of the RSPCA over its successful prosecution of the Heythrop Hunt for breaking hunting law by using hounds to chase foxes in 2012. Scroll down for video . The RSPCA was accused of a political vendetta against the Heythrop Hunt and the magistrate in charge of the case called the prosecution costs run up by the the charity ‘staggering’. Above, huntsmen from the hunt in 2012 . The charity was accused of a political vendetta against the hunt – which once numbered David Cameron among its riders – and the magistrate in charge of the case called the £327,000 prosecution costs run up by the RSPCA ‘staggering’. Fines and costs levied against the hunt came to less than £30,000. Mr Wooler said the charity had over its 190-year history come to act as a private police force pursuing those suspected of animal cruelty. ‘The current role of the RSPCA has evolved largely outside the mainstream criminal justice system and owes more to history than any strategy,’ he said. ‘The unstructured and haphazard environment within which the RSPCA operates now means that the RSPCA role is poorly defined and its relationships with the public bodies with whom its work overlaps are unclear.’ He added that the charity has substantial public support but ‘there are significant weaknesses. In particular, its prosecution role has failed to develop to accord with contemporary expectations of transparency and accountability. It therefore needs to adapt.’ The report recommended that prosecutions under hunting law should be the province of the police and the Crown Prosecution Service, and the charity should act only as a last resort if state organisations fail to act. Cruelty prosecutions should be pared back to avoid clashing with the RSPCA’s campaigning objectives. On the Heythrop prosecution, the report said that the 2004 law outlawing hunting with dogs had failed to stop traditional hunting. ‘The evidence reviewed leaves no room for doubt that, despite the 2004 legislation, traditional fox hunting remains “business as usual” in many parts of the country. 'Extensive flouting of the law risks bringing Parliament, the police and prosecuting authorities into disrepute. Widely publicised criticism of the RSPCA over the costs of the Heythrop Hunt case undoubtedly caused it reputational damage even though the prosecution itself was fully justified,’ it found. The report, which runs to 140 pages and contains a string of recommendations for re-organisation the the charity’s prosecution arm, said the RSPCA must develop an open system of co-operation with state investigators and prosecutors. ‘Without such change, the Society will be vulnerable to those with a very narrow agenda that is not founded on legitimate concern,’ he said. RSPCA chairman Mike Tomlinson said: ‘The RSPCA recognises that the world has dramatically changed during the 190 years that we have been investigating animal welfare complaints and helping to enforce the country’s animal welfare laws. Ruling: On the Heythrop prosecution, the report said that the 2004 law outlawing hunting with dogs had failed to stop traditional hunting. Above, Heythrop Huntsmen and hounds, pictured in 2008 . ‘We accept the need to re-position the RSPCA’s long-standing enforcement role and will now consider these recommendations in detail. We are determined to ensure that we operate an enforcement process fit for the 21st century. The public and the animals deserve no less.’ He added: ‘Hunting prosecutions are a tiny part of the RSPCA’s enforcement work but this review provides an ideal opportunity to look at the way we handle such cases and to make any necessary adjustments. 'Significantly, the review found that the RSPCA’s prosecution of the Heythrop Hunt had been appropriately brought and was not politically motivated. We accept the criticism that the costs of that case were much too high and have implemented lessons learned in subsequent cases.’","The inquiry was led by former Crown Prosecution Service chief inspector.

Tragic: Landslide victim Susan Norman died in Looe, Cornwall last Friday having warned her council about the dangers two months ago . This is the grandmother who died when her home collapsed in floods, just months after she warned her council about the mortal danger her community faced should heavy rains strike. Susan Norman’s ground floor flat was . flattened last Friday as the three-storey building collapsed just before 6am after . violent downpours hit Looe, Cornwall. Tragically the mother-of-two was the only resident who did not escape. Ms Norman had previously warned Cornwall County Council about the danger and . had contributed to a 65-page dossier put together by neighbours . outlining their flood concerns. On Friday more than a dozen local residents were forced to evacuate the street over fears more properties were at risk of damage. But . Ms Norman was the only one who could not be found. Her children, Helen, Matthew and Rachael, had not heard from her since she went to bed at 7pm last Thursday after a long journey. They had clung to the faint hope she . was alive until authorities told them they had found Mrs . Norman’s body in the rubble. Her daughter Rachael Boden said that the . family was ‘extremely numb’. Neighbours said they heard 'windows . popping' at the three-storey property under the pressure of a torrent of . surface water which had been washed down the road behind the building, . split into three flats. Retired police officer Pete Temlett, 59, who compiled the dossier . with local residents, said it was handed to officials in February - two . months before she died. He said the dossier outlined problems dating back over ten years . including blocked drains and poor curbing which were exposing the . building to a serious risk. Distraught: The body of Susan Norman, 68, was found after Veronica Flats in Sandplace Road, Looe, fell done in heavy rain . The council had a ten day period to respond to the residents which . they failed to meet eventually saying they would come back to them by . today. But before they responded Susan was killed and pulled from the home after a search by rescue teams and sniffer dogs. Mr Temlett said: 'The police are now investigating the dossier and . have advised us not to disclose anything from it. The council has failed . to act on information given to them. 'We put in all the evidence with photographs, letters, and e-mails received from the council. 'They refused to accept that we were vulnerable here and we even . asked them if we could be engulfed by the road above and they said they . had surveyed it and were quite happy with how things were. 'Mrs Norman did contribute to it, she told us about her concerns and . safety with water at the back of her house and the water running over. 'She had made it very clear that she had concerns for her safety in . her house as a result of the landslips that had already happened and we . were very aware of that.' Scenic: But the beautiful landscape in Cornwall was the scene of tragedy today . Investigation: Emergency workers with the springer spaniel sniffer dog helping them with the search . The property, named 'Veronica', is . one of a number of detached homes along the road, overlooking a sheer . drop to the picturesque Looe Valley railway line. Sandplace . Road, which runs along the entrance to the properties, has been closed . to traffic for months after a landslide nearby just before Christmas. The . road running along the back of the homes, a main road into the coastal . town of Looe, was said to have been carrying excess surface water which . locals said was caused by a combination of heavy rainfall and uncleared . drains. Location: The house that collapsed is in Looe, near to Plymouth in the eastern part of Cornwall . Devon and Cornwall Police say it has launched a joint investigation with the Health and Safety Executive. A police spokesman said: 'Work is currently on-going to make the site . safe, in order to allow further specialist examinations to take place.' Friend Edwina Hannaford described Ms . Norman as 'a happy, lovely lady'. She said: 'Susan was well-known in the . town and was an active volunteer. She was a very happy lady, very . friendly and smiley, and would always say hello. 'The . whole town has been on tenterhooks waiting for news, and sadly the news . that a body has been found is what we had been fearing.' Cornwall County Council said: 'This is a very tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family and friends of Mrs Norman. The Council is continuing to work with the police and the Health and Safety Executive to carry out a thorough investigation into the cause of the landslip. 'We are providing information relating to the highways and drainage systems in the area to the police and Health and Safety Executive as part of the investigation.'","Mother-of-two Susan Norman died after flat in Looe, Cornwall, collapsed.

60550,"The unnamed US officials said that Russia had deployed a banned cruise missile.
A Kremlin spokesperson said on Wednesday that Russia continued to uphold its international commitments.
The US state department has made no official comment.
The alleged deployment is expected to be discussed during Wednesday's Nato meeting in Brussels, the first since President Trump took office.
Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he would not comment on intelligence reports but added that any non-compliance from Russia on the arms control treaty would be a ""serious concern for the alliance"".
The Brussels meeting will be attended by US Defence Secretary James Mattis.
""Nobody has formally accused Russia of violating the treaty,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a press briefing.
""Russia has been and remains committed to its international commitments, including to the treaty in question,"" he said.
A New York Times report, citing administration officials, said that the Russians now have two battalions of the prohibited cruise missile.
Republican Senator John McCain responded to the missile allegation with a statement calling on the Trump administration to enhance US nuclear deterrents in Europe.
He said Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""testing"" Mr Trump.
The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) was first signed by the US and the Soviet Union in 1987.
It bans the use of ground-based, intermediate-range or short-range missiles by Russia or the US.
Russia has been accused of violating the treaty before, including under the Obama administration.
In 2014, the US accused the Russians of developing and testing cruise missiles.
Mr Putin has also previously said that the treaty no longer serves Russia's interests, and it is unfair as it does not apply to other countries that have since developed missiles within the same range.
The US relationship with Russia remains under intense scrutiny, after General Michael Flynn resigned as the president's national security adviser on Tuesday.
Mr Flynn quit on Monday over claims he discussed US sanctions with Russia before Donald Trump took office. Private citizens are not allowed to conduct US diplomacy.","Russia has been accused of violating the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) by US officials, the Kremlin has said."

49369,"U.S. President Barack Obama didn't speak very long at the White House on Friday, but his message was clear: Russia should not use military force to change the fate of Ukraine. ""The United States will stand with the international community in affirming that there will be costs for any military intervention in Ukraine,"" Obama said. The president made his remarks as events moved quickly in Ukraine, with troops believed to be from Russia moving into Crimea, the southern section of Ukraine that favors close ties with neighboring Russia. Other parts of Ukraine and the new government leaders want to align with Europe. ""We are now deeply concerned by reports of military movements taken by the Russian Federation inside of Ukraine,"" Obama said. ""Russia has a historic relationship with Ukraine, including cultural and economic ties, and a military facility in Crimea, but any violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity would be deeply destabilizing, which is not in the interest of Ukraine, Russia, or Europe. ""It would represent a profound interference in matters that must be determined by the Ukrainian people."" He said Ukraine must be autonomous. ""Throughout this crisis, we have been very clear about one fundamental principle: The Ukrainian people deserve the opportunity to determine their own future,"" he said. Just before Obama spoke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, called for an ""urgent international"" mediation mission to Crimea. Also, a bipartisan group of 12 senators from the Foreign Relations Committee expressed support for U.S. assistance in Ukraine and warned of Russian intervention.

These stunning images show what must surely be one of the world's most unpleasant jobs - mining for sulphur on the side of a volcano in Indonesia. Locals near the Ijen volcano complex risk their lives to get their hands on the foul-smelling mineral, and are usually paid just a few pounds a day. The intrepid miners clamber over sharp rock faces, braving sheer drops from the side of the 2,600-metre-high active volcano which could erupt at any time. Foul: A miner breaks up chunks of sulphur on the side of the Ijen volcano complex in Indonesia . Danger: The intrepid locals scramble over risky rock faces and brave sheer drops with their precious cargo . Haul: Sulphur is used in a number of common industrial processes such as manufacturing cosmetics and plastics . They make their way around a 200-metre-deep lake bubbling with sulphuric acid to gather the valuable substance, which is used in a number of industrial processes. These photographs were captured by Robertus Pudyanto, who chronicles the everyday risks taken by the Indonesian miners.

43013,"Nigel Farage pledged: ""You've not heard the last of us,"" calling the result the most extraordinary for a century.
His party came first in six of the 10 regions to declare, with its strongest performance in the East Midlands.
The electoral ""earthquake"" Mr Farage had predicted came as radical, anti-EU parties on the right and left topped polls across Europe.
UKIP is on course to win its first seat in Scotland, although the confirmed result is not due until later.
But it finished third in London where it polled almost 10% lower than in the country as a whole.
Mr Farage put the party's success down to voters' ""very strong desire"" to have a ""different relationship with Europe"".
He told reporters: ""The message is people have had enough of not being told the truth and not being given the opportunity to express their opinion.
""Five years ago the Conservatives won, giving us a cast-iron guarantee of a referendum they didn't deliver.""
Giving his victory speech in Southampton the UKIP leader said the party's ""people's army"" would now move on to Newark where it is locked in a by-election battle with the Conservatives.
Voters in the Nottinghamshire constituency are set to decide who will replace disgraced Tory MP Patrick Mercer on 5 June.
UKIP's candidate in the poll and re-elected MEP Roger Helmer said he had an ""excellent chance"" of causing an upset.
""It depends on the voters of Newark,"" said Mr Helmer, who came first in the East Midlands region.
""They have to make their choice but I think we have set out tonight reasons why they should make this statement on behalf of Britain.""
Mr Farage admitted the party's hopes were limited but added: ""I am not writing it off.""
In Thursday's European election his anti-EU party beat the Conservatives into second place in the Newark and Sherwood District Council area.
""We will go on next year to the general election with a targeting strategy,"" Mr Farage told jubilant supporters at the count in Southampton.
""And I promise you this - you haven't heard the last of us.""
In Scotland, where UKIP looks like it will secure the party's first seat, would-be MEP David Coburn said: ""With this level of support, UKIP would win significant representation at Holyrood and at Westminster.""
People cast their votes across the UK on Thursday to elect 73 MEPs in 12 separate regional constituencies.
UKIP led Labour in some opinion polls ahead of polling day, but by margins too close to call.
The Conservatives topped the poll five years ago and UKIP, with 16.5%, came just ahead of Labour on 15.7%.
But with only Scotland left to declare UKIP is set to go one better this year, topping the poll with a projected 24 MEPs and 28% of the vote.
In other developments:
UKIP gained 161 council seats in the English local elections but its vote share was down on the previous year.
Its spin doctor Patrick O'Flynn, an ex-newspaper correspondent, was elected as an MEP in the Eastern region.
He hit back at the press for its attacks on the party during the campaign.
""We have a right to claim we are somewhat closer to their readers than some of those newspapers,"" he said.",UKIP has won its first seat in the European Parliament after beating the Conservatives in the count in Southampton.
54835,"The Gay Officers Action League (Goal) has invited Toronto police officers to march, in uniform, during New York City's Pride March.
Police uniforms were banned from Pride Toronto, after outcry from the Black Lives Matter movement.
The controversial ban has raised the ire of many police groups, but has caught on in other Canadian cities.
The New York City Pride March is on the same day as the Toronto parade.
Toronto's police union said it hopes many officers will be able to participate.
""We are honoured that they have invited Toronto police officers to attend and march in their parade with uniforms,"" Mike McCormack, president of the Toronto Police Association, told the BBC.
Members of Pride Toronto voted to ban police uniforms, weapons and vehicles from the parade earlier this year, after protests from Black Lives Matter. Police are allowed to participate as members of the community.
A spokesperson from Pride Toronto declined to comment on GOAL's invitation to Toronto police officers.
The decision has proved divisive within the LGBTQ community and the city at large.
Toronto Pride said the ban was necessary in order to include communities who feel marginalised by police.
But the Toronto Police Association has been vocally opposed to the ban, even going so far as to ask the city to pull funding from Toronto Pride, which the city declined to do.
""This type of restriction is a step backwards for both our gay officers and the relationship Toronto Police have tried to build with the community,"" Mr McCormack said.
About 10,000 people have signed a petition on Change.org asking for uniformed police to be allowed to march in the parade.
Marching in uniform is an important part of any pride parade, said GOAL's executive director William Shephard.
""We actually had to sue in the United States federal court in 1997 for the right to march in the NYPD uniforms in New York City Pride,"" Mr Shephard told the Toronto Star.",Toronto police officers are to be allowed to march in a Pride parade in New York City.

The Haidian People's Court sentenced Li, 17, and four other defendants to jail terms ranging from three to 12 years over the gang rape of a woman in a hotel room in February. Li, also known as Li Guanfeng, denied the charges, telling the court he was drunk and could recall little of the night in question. He denied beating or having sex with the woman despite his four co-accused issuing guilty pleas by the trial's end, state media reported. Lawyers for the accused argued in pre-trial hearings that the woman was a prostitute, and the matter should be tried as a prostitution matter, rather than a rape case. In handing down the verdict, the court said the evidence was ""adequate"" to uphold the rape charges. Users on Chinese social media applauded the verdict, hailing it as a victory of justice over the infamous ""taizidang,"" or ""princelings,"" who are widely regarded as spoiled and corrupt. ""The bastard is finally charged. God finally works,"" wrote a user called @Jiaxinglantianxiadezhiai on the popular Chinese micro-blogging service Sina Weibo.

75934,"Sportsmail's former Premier League ref says there is no campaign against Chelsea . At Chelsea’s training ground on Friday lunchtime there was an empty space in the area usually reserved for Jose Mourinho’s sponsored Jaguar. Instead his assistant first team coach Steve Holland was the back seat driver after Chelsea’s manager pulled out of his pre-match briefing because he is upset with the FA over his latest misconduct charge. Holland proved more than capable, occasionally steering towards controversy with some strident views on ‘the campaign’, the mood around the Chelsea camp and the delicate issue of Frank Lampard. This, even by Chelsea’s standards, was spiky stuff. Chelsea players go through their stretches as Jose Mourinho jokes around with his team during training on Friday .

The Chelsea squad laugh as Mourinho instructs his players during a stretching session . Mourinho (right) looks on in training as Chelsea prepare to host Newcastle at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . ‘There is a frustration among all of us, not just Jose, because of an accumulation of events which surfaced at the Southampton game with Cesc Fabregas,’ Holland said in the minutes after he finished off the final training session ahead of today’s clash with Newcastle. ‘With Cesc, if they don’t want to give a pen, that’s a mistake, but to book him really compounds that pain. ‘First you’re saying it’s cheating and second he misses a game at some point. Bookings can’t be rescinded. That was a really painful day for us, hence the strength of feeling in the group. ‘We don’t really do draws. The objective is to win and if we don’t then the mood is always different. ‘People don’t walk around laughing or joking. The mood is up and down depending on the result.’ Safe to say, then, that the Grizzly Bear is in a bad place after the FA rapped his knuckles because of his demand for strong refereeing at Stoke City and subsequently charged him for his comments directed at Anthony Taylor after the Southampton game.

Mourinho took Friday training but skipped his pre-match press conference following his misconduct charge by the FA . Assistant Holland instead addressed the media where he backed Mourinho's claim in that there is a campaign against the Blues . In the absence of Mourinho, it was left to Holland to move the subject on to Eden Hazard and some of the more enthusiastic challenges carried out by defenders in the Barclays Premier League. There are, in support of Holland’s argument, various pictures of Hazard’s socks being cut to ribbons in recent weeks. Chelsea’s assistant head coach added: ‘With the diving thing, the technology is so good now and you can watch it back five times to highlight someone being in the air a bit longer than he should have done. But look at Hazard at Stoke. If he doesn’t see that coming and doesn’t get his studs off the ground, that challenge finishes his career. ‘If players anticipate challenges they try to get their feet off the ground. That makes it a very difficult job for referees. ‘But Hazard just gets on with it. He’s incredible with the stick he takes. That is part of it — if he’s a model pro and gets up straight away after being whacked, that could discourage a referee from taking action against a player who is trying to take him out of the game. Five minutes later he gets whacked again because the player hasn’t got a yellow card. It’s all part of what a player thinks is right or wrong. Cesc Fabregas goes down in the penalty area after a challenge by Southampton youngster Matt Targett . The Chelsea midfielder reacts as referee Anthony Taylor shows him a yellow card during the match at St Mary's . ‘Filipe Luis was on the receiving end of a tackle (by Tom Huddlestone) against Hull on the halfway line. Those two tackles were career-ending tackles if they connect, no doubt. Yet we spend two or three days talking about how long a player has spent in the air rather than what is done about the perpetrators of those challenges. Where’s the logic in that? ‘If nothing’s done, players like Hazard will not be able to show supporters the ability that he undoubtedly has. Eden is a very honest, top guy, that’s for sure. I’m sure he’s learning to protect himself because you can’t rely on anybody else to do it. You have to do it yourself.’ He was also willing to expand on the complex issue surrounding Lampard after the clumsy handling of his aborted move to New York City. Mourinho always dodges this one, but Holland was happy to put forward his own ideas on the issue. He said: ‘What has occurred now wasn’t the original plan, that’s clear.’ Filipe Luis (left), Willian and Fabregas speak to referee Taylor at the end of the Premier League encounter . Mourinho (right) was clearly annoyed and spoke to his support staff after Fabregas was booked for diving against the Saints . Some Chelsea supporters are disgruntled over the situation, and Holland added: ‘I think that would depend from fan to fan, but Frank is entitled to make the decision that is best for him and supporters are free to feel the way they do. Frank was a fantastic player for Chelsea, who will be revered by supporters forever. Now he is a City player, a club we are directly challenging with. Whatever has happened, that’s the situation. ‘He’s scoring goals and I am not surprised by that because he has always had that ability. It’s a difficult situation. ‘By leaving, it’s activated a part of him that perhaps wouldn’t have been activated if he’d stayed here.’",Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has been charged with misconduct by the FA.

61438,"Steve Ashman said the man's information led to the conviction of 17 men and a woman for abusing girls in Newcastle.
The informant was paid £10,000, and headlines have focused on criticism of that, rather than on the case.
The paedophile had himself served a prison sentence for rape.
The last of four trials, spread across two years, ended on Wednesday and in total 18 people, mostly of Asian backgrounds, were convicted of sexual exploitation and drugs offences.
Most of them were men from Pakistani, Bangladeshi or Indian backgrounds.
The court heard how vulnerable girls and women were abused at parties or ""sessions"" in Newcastle.
Northumbria Police asked a previously convicted child rapist if he could get them more information about the parties.
The NSPCC said that using him in this way was a decision that ""crossed the line"".
Jim Gamble, former head of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, said: ""Personally, I can't envisage circumstances where I would have authorised payment to someone convicted of rape.
""I can't imagine how you could have control mechanisms in place with an informant of that type that you were going to task that would give reassurance that they still didn't represent a risk to young and vulnerable women.""
But Northumbria Police's Chief Constable Steve Ashman rejected suggestions that the informant was encouraged to go to the parties in order to report back to them.
In fact, Mr Ashman said the informant was specifically told he would be arrested if he attended the parties himself.
He said: ""In this specific instance, we used an informant in very controlled circumstances.

The US is spending $9m this year on helping clean up unexploded ordnance left over from the Vietnam War in Laos.
Mrs Clinton will then head to Cambodia for an Asean meeting.
The US dropped two million tons of bombs on Laos during the Vietnam War and unexploded bombs are still affecting lives and agriculture in the South East Asian nation.
The last top US diplomat to visit Laos was John Foster Dulles in 1955.
The US and Laos also ""agreed to improve and further facilitate the accounting operations for American personnel still missing from the Indochina War era"", said a statement released following Mrs Clinton's meeting with Mr Thongsing.
The two sides also discusssed Laos' pending entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Mrs Clinton visited a Buddhist temple and a prosthetic centre funded by the US, the Associated Press reports.
Another key item on her agenda, reports say, is the controversial Mekong River dam, which critics say would have a major impact on the environment and millions of lives.
The $3.8bn (Â£2.4bn) hydro-electric dam project at Xayaburi has caused tension among Mekong region countries - Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand.
In April, a multi-billion dollar contract was signed for a Thai company, CH Karnchang, to build the dam.
The Lao government has pledged not to go ahead with the project until environmental issues have been resolved.
However, activists say work on the project has already begun, with reports and photographs emerging of construction vehicles in the area.
Mrs Clinton's trip is part of a tour of Asia which analysts say signals the United States' growing interest in the region.
""My trip reflects a strategic priority of American foreign policy today,"" she told reporters in Mongolia earlier this week.
""After 10 years in which we focused a great deal of attention on the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, the United States is making substantially increased investments - diplomatic, economic, strategic and otherwise - in this part of the world. It's what we call our pivot toward Asia.""
At the Asean regional forum later this week in the Cambodian capital, where she will join counterparts from the 10-nation bloc and other Asian countries, including China, tension in the South China Sea is expected to top the agenda.

She had also stolen from charity shops. Oxley of Smith Street, Nelson, pleaded guilty to robbery and was jailed for four years.

It was explained to the court that Oxley had had a significant heroin problem for 20 years, had been desperate for cash and accepted she had ‘sunk as low as she had done’ to behave as she did and that she apologised to the victim. In mitigation, Richard Taylor, for Oxley added that she was ‘inadequate in many ways and pathetic in the true sense of the word’. Sentencing, Judge Beverley Lunt told Oxley she had a ‘dreadful record’ and said of the victim: ‘She was left shocked, she was left hurt, she was left bleeding and you just didn’t care. You ran away.’ Judge Lunt made rewards of £250 each from public funds for Mr Smith and Mr Marshall for their ‘bravery and public spiritedness’ in intervening and detaining Oxley. After the case Detective Constable Dave Greenwood of Lancashire Police said: ‘Oxley targeted and preyed on an elderly and vulnerable member of the public.‘She showed no remorse for her despicable actions and I am pleased with the sentence she has been given. ‘I would like to praise the bravery shown by the members of the public who chased after Oxley. Their courageous actions undoubtedly helped officers to make a quick arrest and secure a successful conviction at court. ‘The local community should be proud that people like this live amongst them.

49940,"Tory transport spokesman Russell George accused the Welsh Government of ""hypocrisy"", given its view that Severn Bridge tolls should be abolished.
Referring to the Cleddau Bridge tolls at 75p for cars and £1.50 for lorries, he said: ""They've done nothing to tackle the one toll it could scrap.""
The Welsh Government said it was a local authority matter.
Pembrokeshire council decided in May to keep the tolls in place after a review.
The criticism comes after the UK government announced plans to cut the Severn Bridge tolls by more than half.
Cars, vans and small buses could pay as little as £3 from 2018, after the crossings return to public ownership.
Wales' Economy Secretary Ken Skates said the tolls should be scrapped, as a tax on entering Wales.
Mr George criticised the minister, claiming he failed to answer his point about the Cleddau Bridge when he raised the issue of tolls in the Senedd.
""It's a bit rich of the Welsh Labour government to grumble about the Severn Bridge tolls when they've done nothing to tackle the one toll it could scrap,"" Mr George said.
""Hardworking people across Pembrokeshire will rightly question why the Cleddau Bridge is not afforded the same focus and status.""
He added: ""The decision to cut the Severn Bridge tolls by the UK Conservative government is a huge boost to motorists.
""While there's no doubt we'd all like to see the abolition of tolls in the future - what is much more important, however, is having a Welsh Government focusing its energy on decisions it has power over and can implement immediately.""
In May, Pembrokeshire council revealed that it had accumulated a surplus of £11.2m on Cleddau Bridge tolls, and confirmed it would keep the charges unchanged.
In response, Mr Skates said: ""Nobody is fooled by this cynical Tory attack designed to divert attention from the real story.
""The Conservatives have clearly been stung by the fact that they are the only party that want to maintain a tax on businesses and individuals for using a road crucial to the economy of south Wales.
""Welsh businesses will not be taken in by this attempt to deflect from the Conservative UK government's failure to scrap the Severn Bridge tolls, despite our consistent calls to do so.
""The tolls on Cleddau Bridge are a matter for the local authority and not the Welsh Government.""","The Welsh Labour government has been accused of ""grossing"" over plans to scrap the Severn Bridge tolls."

44743,"By . Snejana Farberov . PUBLISHED: . 11:29 EST, 11 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:14 EST, 11 December 2013 . Survivor: Karen Perrin spent night hours trying to free herself after getting locked inside a restroom at work . For Karen Perrin, what started as an innocent trip to the ladies’ room at work Friday night ended eight terrifying hours later with her clawing her way to freedom. Mrs Perrin, the wife of former Washington Redskins running back Lonnie Perrin, works as a senior assistant at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Washington, DC. On Friday, she stayed at the office until 10pm making travel arrangements for her boss, who was preparing to go abroad. She called her husband to let him known that she was going to head home in 10-15 minutes. With the details of the trip finalized, Perrin packed her bags but decided to use the restroom before going home. She left her cell phone at her desk. After emerging from the stall, the woman washed her hands and made for the door, but it turned out to be locked. ‘It sounds crazy, but I went back into the stall and then washed my hands again hoping to change something,' Mrs Perrin told ABC News. Growing nervous, the trapped woman jiggled the latch, kicked it with her foot, but it would not budge. 'That's when it hit me,' she recalled. 'I'm locked in here.' Karen Perrin spent the next eight hours desperately trying to escape. Escape route: After realizing she was trapped, Perrin tried shoving paper towels under the door to draw someone's attention . Fighting tooth and nail: The woman eventually got her hands on a metal rod and began hacking at the drywall until she finally made a hole big enough for her hand to go through it . 'I felt hopelessness. I felt like I was going to die in there because of the anxiety I was feeling,' she told the station. Unable to call for help, Perrin started pulling paper towels and shoving them under the door in the hope of drawing the attention of a security guard monitoring surveillance cameras. ‘I probably put 200 towels out,’ Perrin recalled. ‘But after nobody came to rescue me I realized I had to do something else.’ Looking for an alternate escape route, Perrin climbed on a chair and reached a hatch in the ceiling. Although she was unable to pull herself up, she discovered a 3-foot-long pole in the rafters. Famous spouse: Karen is married to former Washington Redskins running back Lonnie Perrin (right) In a scene straight out of the classic 1994 prison-break film Shawshank Redemption, the office worker clawed her way through the wall using the metal tool until she was able to make a hole big enough for her hand to reach through it and open the door from the other side. After two hours of hacking at the wall with the metal rod through layers of drywall and insulation, Perrin finally created an opening next to the doorknob, stuck her arm through it, bloodying it in the process, grabbed the handle on the other side and sprung herself free, MyFox DC reported. ‘I was crying. I felt like I was escaping a bad dream, like when you have a nightmare and you wake up and your heart is pounding and you realize, ""Oh, I was just dreaming. Did that just happen. Am I OK?”’ she said. Worried sick: Lonnie Perrin, pictured left in 1977 when he was playing for the Broncos, feared that something terrible had happened to his wife (right) when she failed to come home . Karen immediately called her husband and daughter, who feared that something terrible had happened to her after she failed to come home, and were on the verge of going out to search for her. Mrs Perrin suffered contusions to her hands, but said she does not plan to pursue legal action. However, she hopes that the management of the building would put safety measures in place to prevent similar incidents in the future.

3367,"But the chairman, European Council President Donald Tusk, will keep the two discussions separate - despite concern that some jihadists are slipping into the EU posing as migrants and exploiting the freedom of movement provided by the Schengen zone.
At least two of the killers involved in the Paris attacks got in among the crowds of migrants arriving daily on the Greek islands near Turkey.
But EU leaders are anxious to avoid sounding like the nationalists who argue that the removal of border controls in the EU left Europeans more at risk from terrorists. That is the rallying cry of the French National Front (FN) and some other populist parties.
Migration and terrorism are also treated as separate issues because - as pointed out by EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - many asylum-seekers are themselves fleeing from the terror inflicted by Islamic State (IS), the Taliban and other extremist groups.
The dilemma for the EU is that Schengen - the passport-free area embracing 26 countries - greatly eases the flow of people and goods across the EU, but also requires more information-sharing, to prevent cross-border criminality.
About 1.7 million EU citizens cross borders daily in the Schengen zone to go to work, the Bruegel think-tank reports.
And opinion polls indicate that many Europeans value Schengen more than any other change brought about by the EU.
But temporary border controls have been reimposed - by France, Germany, Austria and Hungary.
So the stakes are high at this summit.
""Our goal is clear: we must regain control over our external borders to stem migratory flows and to preserve Schengen,"" said Mr Tusk in his summit invitation letter.
Mr Juncker said Europeans now have ""one border"" and ""a shared responsibility to protect it"".
""We want to defend everything Schengen represents, and let me tell you that Schengen is here to stay,"" he told the European Parliament.
Saving Schengen means beefing up the surveillance of all people entering or leaving the Schengen area.
So in future EU citizens, as well as those from outside the bloc, will have their passports checked against police databases.
There is much work to do, however, to link up and improve those databases.
More than a million refugees and other migrants have surged into the EU this year, most of them desperate to reach Germany or other northern countries where job prospects are better, or where relatives can help them settle.
The Syrian war has pushed irregular migration to the EU to a record high.
There are fears that the international campaign to smash IS, and the Russian bombing in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, will drive even more Syrians to flee abroad.
So the 28 leaders in Brussels will look again at the EU's help for Greece and Turkey. The migrant registration process is still slow and patchy.
Turkey, struggling with more than two million Syrian refugees, now has much bargaining power. Critics say the EU risks compromising its human rights standards as it leans on Turkey to curb the migrant flow.
Greek coastguards and the EU's Frontex border agency only manage to intercept 20% of the migrants who reach Greek islands after life-threatening voyages, according to Frontex.
This week the Commission unveiled an ambitious plan for a new EU Border and Coast Guard to tackle problems on the EU's external borders.
The force - stronger than Frontex - would have 1,000 permanent staff and 1,500 reserves, who could be deployed rapidly to a trouble spot, within three days.
That could happen even without the host country requesting it - if the rest of the EU decides to take action.
Such force majeure might be the exception - but Poland has already raised objections on sovereignty grounds.
Once again, the migrant crisis is threatening to divide, more than unite, Europe.",The EU's 28 leaders are meeting in Brussels to discuss the migrant crisis and terrorism.

On Friday it emerged two of Mr Blair's close New Labour allies - Lord Mandelson and Alastair Campbell - spoke to Alan Johnson about rumours he was willing to replace Mr Miliband as Labour leader. Both men denied urging Mr Johnson to launch a leadership challenger, but it was seen as the latest sign of New Labour veterans' unhappiness with Mr Miliband. However, Mr Blair has now signalled that he is ready to campaign for Labour in the run up to the general election in three months' time. The former PM's office told The Observer that regarding 'his involvement in the party's election campaign, he will do whatever the party wants'. However, MailOnline understands that there is unease among some of Mr Miliband's team, and MPs elected in 2010, about being seen to rely on Mr Blair for support. Rows about delays to the Iraq War inquiry have reignited the division in the Labour party about Mr Blair's decision to back the 2003 invasion. 'I'm not sure we would want him,' said one Labour frontbencher. 'It would look a bit odd after Ed has done so much to distance himself from New Labour and Iraq and all of that.' Mr Blair campaigned in some seats in 2010, including Redditch for former home secretary Jacqui Smith, who went on to lose her seat . Mr Blair also campaigned in Oldham and Saddleworth, which Labour later won in an election re-run, and his appearance at Trimdon Labour club during the 2010 campaign was targeted by anti-Iraq war protesters . Half of voters think the Labour party has been damaged by recent attacks from senior business. Industry leaders credited with the success of well-known chains including Boots, M&S, Pizza Express and Lastminute.com have turned their fire on Labour in recent days, warning victory for Mr Miliband would plunge Britain into an economic catastrophe. A YouGov poll for The Sunday Times shows 52 per cent of people think the criticism damages Labour, while only 7 per cent think it helps them. Overall, some 43 per cent of voters think a Labour victory would be bad for British business while just 19 per cent think it would be good. Only 19 per cent think Labour has the best policies towards British business, compared to 33 per cent who said the same of the Conservatives. In a fresh blow, Chris Wright, founder of the music publishing giant Chrysalis who backed Labour in the run-up to the 2005 election, warned Labour risked stoking a 'politics of envy' that would damage Britain's economic prospects. 'In the current Labour leadership there's a vein of thought that is to some extent anti-wealth creator and antibusiness and that is a great shame,' he said. However, others want to see Mr Blair back on the campaign trail, as he did in some seats in the run-up to the 2010 election when his great rival Gordon Brown was seeking election. A shadow cabinet minister said: 'Tony is a rock star. In the right seats people still love seeing him, it is a bit of celebrity stardust on the campaign trail.' A poll for the Observer showed the Opposition up one point from a fortnight ago on 34%, two ahead of the Conservatives, unchanged on 32 per cent. Ukip dropped three points to 15 per cent in the Opinium research while the Greens and the Liberal Democrats both moved up two points to 8 per cent and 7 per cent respectively. Mr Miliband remained significantly less well regarded than Tory Prime Minister David Cameron - with a satisfaction score of minus 26 to the PM's minus five. Lord Mandelson, one of the architects of New Labour, said Mr Miliband  'will make a very good prime minister' and suggested  corporate leaders 'will become much more reassured' about the Opposition's stance by the time of May's general election. The peer accepted that more needed to be done to counter the impression being created but said the criticism was a deliberate attempt to misrepresent the party's position. 'We've got two months to show that he can make the case,' he said. 'I believe he has, but I believe there is a determination also to portray him in a very negative way.' He and ex-Downing Street media chief Mr Campbell contacted Mr Johnson over speculation that he was being lined up by MPs seeking to oust Mr Miliband. But both countered a claim in the Financial Times they  'took soundings to see whether he was prepared to take over' insisting they did nothing more than ascertain from a friend that the rumours he was being lined up were untrue. Mr Johnson served in the Cabinet for six years and was seen as a safe pair of hands, popular with the media and the public. After Mr Miliband won the Labour leadership he appointed Mr Johnson as shadow chancellor, but he remained in post for just three months, resigning after revelations about his wife having an affair. However, many still view the former postman and trade union leader as a possible caretaker leader if Mr Miliband's woeful personal ratings risked prevent Labour winning the election. Peter Mandelson and Alastair Campbell held talks with Alan Johnson amid growing speculation that he would take the helm of the party to prevent a second election defeat . Mr Johnson has ruled out ever standing for the Labour leadership, to the dismay of his many supporters in the party . New Labour supporters were seen as being closer to Mr Miliband's brother David, but he stepped down as an MP after losing the leadership against to his brother. At least 40 Labour MPs are believed to have backed the abortive coup, which occurred weeks after the Labour leader's conference speech last autumn. Tensions between Mr Miliband and New Labour grandees have been renewed in recent days, after losing the support of business leaders seen as crucial to Mr Blair's three election triumphs. The leadership speculation came at the end of a week when captains of industry and entrepreneurs have lined up to warn against a Labour victory. Business leaders credited with the success of well-known chains including Boots, M&S, Pizza Express and Lastminute.com have turned their fire on Labour in recent days, warning victory for Mr Miliband would plunge Britain into an economic catastrophe. Sir Charles Dunstone, who was one of 63 signatories to a letter of support for Labour in 2005, told the Financial Times the business community felt 'isolated' by Labour's shift to the left. 'As a business person I'm frightened of an environment where there isn't sufficient emphasis put on growing the economy to grow tax receipts to spend more money,' he said. However, Lord Levy, formerly Tony Blair's chief fundraiser who helped New Labour form close ties with business, said he was 'saddened' by the attacks on Mr Miliband.",Former PM has promised to do 'whatever the party wants' to secure Labour victory.

63217,"High bids traditionally mark the year's first auction at Tokyo's Tsukiji fish market.
Even the buyer, sushi chain owner Kiyoshi Kimura, who also paid out the record price last year, said the cost was ""a bit high"".
The sale came amid continued warnings from environmentalists that tuna stocks are dwindling and overfished.
This year's record-breaking fish was caught off north-eastern Japan and weighed in at 222kg (489lbs), some 47kg lighter than last year's prize-winner, which fetched 56m yen.
The prices do not necessarily reflect quality or size and are more linked to publicity and setting the tone for the business year.
The auction at the market - which trades millions of dollars of products daily and is a popular tourist destination -  began at 05:00 local time.
Mr Kimura immediately carted his purchase off to a nearby branch of his Sushi Zanmai chain.
He said he wanted to ""encourage Japan"" with his bid.
The price works out at about $7,600 per kg ($3,500/lb).
Japan consumes more than half of the world's bluefin catch.
New figures to be released on Monday are expected to show a continued decline in Pacific bluefin stocks.
Amanda Nickson, of the Pew Environmental Group's global tuna conservation campaign, told Associated Press news agency: ""Everything we're hearing is that there's no good news for the Pacific bluefin. We're seeing a very high value fish continue to be overfished.""",The world's largest bluefin fish has been sold for a record-breaking price at a Japanese market.
77125,"Jersey Heritage Trust Conservator Neil Maher has spent the past year creating a model of the one tonne mound of silver and copper coins, gold pieces and mud.
He said: ""This is the world's biggest Celtic coin hoard ever, this was a significant part of a tribe's wealth.
""It is also one of the world's biggest coin hoards and certainly the biggest coin hoard found in Britain.""
Work to separate and uncover the secrets of the hoard has been delayed while Mr Mahrer works on other projects and details are agreed over long term conservation plans.
A large mound containing about 70,000 coins was discovered last year by two metal detector enthusiasts.
Reg Mead and Richard Miles began their hunt after a woman told them her father had found coins in a field some years before.
After the initial work looking at the surface of the mound taken from the ground in Jersey, Mr Mahrer started the process of replicating the object.
He said: ""You mix silicon rubbers up, pour them on to the hoard and it will set on there. It then records in fine details so you can use copies for microscopic work.
""It was quit scary as I told people it would be fine, there would be no damage. I had used the technique on smaller things so was really pleased it worked out well.""
When decisions are made over who has responsibility for conservation, Mr Mahrer said the work would begin to separate and catalogue every item contained in the hoard.
""Because we knew the process we want to do on the real hoard involves taking apart coin by coin by coin, we knew we would lose the original appearance.
""We thought that was important because, not only is it a pretty thing, but there might be important information in its size and shape in the future,"" he said.
The process of making a replica revealed a number of surprises according to Mr Mahrer.
He said: ""It was a bit of a bonus if slightly embarrassing, one small part of the side collapsed more than I hoped and we lost two or three coins from a small area on one side.
""Completely by chance in there we found a small gold coin and it is the first gold one we have found.
""There are about 70,000 coins in the hoard but all the ones we have found so far are a mixture of silver and copper.
""Of the ones which fell out one was a small thick gold one which is about 100 years older than the rest of the coins.""
He said they had uncovered about 1% of the coins so far and five gold items had been uncovered.
""As this one about three or four coin depths fell out it leads to the question 'what else is in there'. We have only scraped the surface and we have already found five gold objects,"" he said.
Mr Mahrer said if they continued finding gold on that ratio, it could push up the value of the hoard.
""One gold coin on its own wouldn't add much to the value, a few hundred pounds, but if we get in and find more then who knows?""
He added: ""We deliberately haven't removed any coins from the hoard yet, we are still waiting for various permissions over who owns the hoard and funding before we take it apart.""
The value of the hoard was estimated at up to Â£10m when it was first removed from the ground.
Work is now under way to prepare the coins already uncovered, and the replica made by Mr Mahrer, for an exhibition at Jersey Museum next year.
The last time it went on display in 2012 the number of visitors to the museum trebled.",A conservationist has made a replica of a hoard of Celtic coins found in a field in Jersey.
1890,"Andy Barrett, 68, who wants to be known as the pub's creator rather than its landlord, said he was hoping for a ""bumper weekend"".
He believes The Little Prince, which measures just 11ft by 7ft (3m by 2m), is one of the UK's smallest.
And he is hopeful the quirky bar will soon turn into a tourist attraction.
""I came across an empty unit, which used to be a sushi bar, and the idea came to me - there was no pub around and I thought it would be quite novel,"" Mr Barrett said.
""Margate is busy, it has so many attractions, the beach, Dreamland, carnival weekend, there will be lots of people dropping in.""
The Nutshell in Bury St Edmunds has up until now claimed the record as the UK's tiniest.  But manager Jack Burton does not mind if he loses the top spot.
""We've had a good run of it,"" he said, ""but I'd be interested to see what [The Little Prince] has done with the space.""
The Nutshell has been serving customers since 1867.  It measures just 15ft by 7ft (4.5m by 2m) and ""comfortably holds 20 standing up"".
Mr Burton said the tiny Victorian establishment became a tourist attraction after it was listed in the Guinness Book of Records during the 90s as the smallest pub in the world.
Its interior is plastered with historical items, photos and memorabilia, including a mummified cat.
Mr Burton said the limited space never presented a problem. ""It draws people in, becomes a tourist attraction, and provides a cosy atmosphere which is lacking in many pubs.""
However, one pub that would dispute The Little Prince's claim is The Signal Box Inn in Cleethorpes, which claims it is the ""smallest pub on the planet"".
Open for 10 years, it operates on the site of the Cleethorpes Coast Light Railway and was created from a genuine Victorian signal box.
The box was being used as a garden shed until a young couple came up with the plan to turn it into a bar.
It measures just 8ft by 8ft (2m by 2m) although it does also have a beer garden.
Manager Andy Cawood said the box, which sits four to six comfortably, once managed to squeeze in 35 Cleethorpes rugby players.
""It has a wonderful atmosphere. It just emits enthusiasm. People can see it is a genuine Victorian signal box. It is such a fun place,"" he said.","A tiny pub in Margate, which was once a sushi bar, is hoping to win the world record for the smallest pub."

Two 17-year-olds, an 18-year-old and two 19-year-olds have been treated for alcohol-related liver disease in UK hospitals over the last three years. Cirrhosis of the liver is normally associated with binge drinking for ten years or more, but experts have suggested it is now occurring over a shorter period.

The two 17-year-olds, meanwhile, were treated at St James's University Hospital in Leeds and Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. The second 19-year-old was treated at Royal Free Hospital in North London. The paper also reported that at least one patient in their 20s with the condition received a transplant.

He is also accused of fleeing to Spain 10 days later ""to avoid arrest, prosecution and conviction"".
Mr Paterson denies all the charges against him and has lodged two special defences of alibi and incrimination.
The trial is taking place at the High Court in Glasgow.
An excerpt from a telephone call made by Mr Paterson to his girlfriend Sarah Maguire from prison in October last year was played to the court.
In it he was heard telling her that he had been served with his indictment and that there were 350 witnesses on the list, including her father.
Giving evidence to the jury, Miss Maguire's father Kevin Maguire, 70, told the court that Mr Paterson was in a relationship with his daughter and before going to Spain in January 2010 sometimes stayed at their house.
Det Sgt Grant Durie, who searched the house where Miss Maguire lived with her father in Cumbernauld, also gave evidence.
He told the court he was the crime scene manager and that during the search a bulletproof vest was found under the bed in Miss Maguire's room.
Advocate depute Iain McSporran asked if it was if it was ""unusual"" to find it and he said it was.
The prosecutor asked how many times he had previously come across a bulletproof vest during searches and he replied: ""That was the first time, sir.""
The officer also told the court that Kevin Carroll had the nickname ""Gerbil"".
He confirmed that a man called Ross Monaghan had been arrested and charged with Mr Carroll's murder.
It is claimed - while masked and acting with others - Mr Paterson repeatedly discharged loaded handguns at 29-year-old Mr Carroll shooting him on the head and body.
The 35-year-old is also accused of attempting to defeat the ends of justice.
The indictment claims that on 23 January 2010 he boarded a flight from Glasgow to Malaga ""to avoid arrest, prosecution and conviction"".
Mt Paterson further faces a number of firearms charges as well as another accusation of attempting to defeat the ends of justice.
He is also said to have been involved in the reset of a car or an alternative accusation of being in the vehicle knowing it had been taken without consent.

He said the ""pace of change remains too slow"".
Warner said the stances taken by athletics' governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) could be seen as a ""turning point"".
Russians have been banned by the IAAF from competing since November 2015, while the IPC banned Russia from taking part in the 2016 Rio Paralympics.

UKA highlighted steps that have since been taken:
As part of its rebrand, UKA's anti-doping department will be renamed 'Clean Athletics' and the sport's governing body suggests other anti-doping agencies should do the same to ""emphasise the ultimate purpose of their activities"".
Warner added Clean Athletics ""would urge other sports to follow suit to remain focused on what they want to achieve"".

At the time of UKA's proposals last year, authorities were already aware of alleged widespread doping in Russia with the country provisionally suspended from international competition.
Since then, in an investigation commissioned by Wada, reports from Professor Richard McLaren found more than 1,000 Russians - including Olympic medallists - benefited from a state-sponsored doping programme between 2011 and 2015.
As a result, Wada recommended all Russian athletes be banned from competing from the Rio 2016 Olympics and Paralympics.
On Tuesday, leaders of 19 national anti-doping organisations said Russia should be banned from both competing in and hosting international sporting events.

He was already serving a 25-year sentence from a previous trial. He ruled Argentina from June 1982 until the nation's return to democracy in December 1983. Argentina's 2nd Oral Federal Court handed down the ruling. The punishment stems from an investigation into a clandestine detention facility hidden inside a hospital during the country's military dictatorship. Under his command, at least 22 people were kidnapped and taken to the center, known as the ""Chalet at the Posadas Hospital,"" according to evidence in the case. Five of those were tortured during their detention, according to Argentina's judicial information center. Bignone, was previously sentenced in April 2010 to 25 years in prison for kidnapping and torturing 56 people. Up to 30,000 students, labor leaders, intellectuals and leftists who ran afoul of the dictatorship because of their political views disappeared or were held in secret jails and torture centers during the nation's eight-year ""dirty war.""",Gen.

Amy Winehouse left behind a £3million fortune following her death last year, it has been revealed. The singer, who was 27, had an estate worth £4,257,580, which was reduced to £2,944,554 after paid debts and taxes.

6110,"Scotland's chief statistician said there had also been a 4% reduction in homelessness applications compared to the previous year.
However, there was a rise in the number of children in temporary accommodation.
The Scottish government said it wanted to work to reduce homelessness even further.
The Homelessness and Housing Options Statistics report found there were 28,000 cases in Scotland assessed as homeless or threatened with homelessness.
Of these, 25,000 cases were judged to be ""unintentionally homeless"" and therefore with a right to settled accommodation. About two-thirds secured this accommodation, mainly through the social or private rented sector.
Scottish local authorities said they received about 35,000 homelessness applications during 2015/16.
There has been no change in the number of households in temporary accommodation.
Shelter Scotland said the statistics showed 591 more children were homeless and living in temporary accommodation in 2015/16 than the year before.
The organisation's head of communications and policy, Adam Lang, called the figures ""worrying"" and said they should set ""alarm bells ringing"" when combined with the 220,000 children living in poverty in Scotland.
He added: ""The impact of poverty and homelessness on children's health and life chances can be devastating. Children living in temporary accommodation can miss up to 55 school days a year, that's a quarter of the school year.
""If Scotland is serious about tackling child poverty and closing the educational attainment gap, then ministers must act now to ensure that all children in Scotland have access to a safe, secure and affordable home.""
Shelter Scotland also said Scotland needed a ""major step change in the supply of new affordable homes"".
Scottish Housing Minister Kevin Stewart welcomed the decrease in homelessness and said the government was doing all it could to make sure everyone had access to a ""warm and safe place to stay"".
""It is, however, our aim to stop people becoming homeless in the first place which is much better for our people and our communities, and of course our homelessness services,"" he said.
""While there are many reasons for families staying in temporary accommodation, I am disappointed in the increase in the number of children in temporary accommodation.
""Although the majority of temporary accommodation is good quality, well managed social housing which is of the exact same standard as permanent accommodation, I am keen to see these numbers decrease and people to have a settled home.""","The number of people in Scotland who are homeless or threatened with homelessness has fallen by 4% in 2015/16, according to a report by Shelter Scotland."

76788,"The emergence of the U-Boat as a German weapon forced the Royal Navy to move its grand fleet from its northern home at Scapa Flow in Scotland.
They went to one of the most peaceful spots in the British Isles - Lough Swilly.
At that time, it was pre-partition Ireland.
Forty fighting ships including battleships, cruisers and destroyers sailed into the lough.
They were guarded on either side of its mouth by specially built forts with long-range guns, including Fort Dunree on the Inishowen peninsula.
The fleet commander, Admiral Jellicoe, saw the base as one that was safe from U-Boat attack.
But, in the years to come, the German attack would take its toll in the cold waters off Donegal, sinking HMS Audacious and the SS Laurentic.
Eventually, Jellicoe knew he would have to return to the North Sea to face the Kaiser's fleet - an appointment met on 31 May 1916 off Denmark, in what became known as the Battle of Jutland.
Although it was far from Ireland's shores, 358 Irishmen serving as volunteer sailors died in that battle as the two fleets traded shells for dominance of the seas.
Later on Tuesday, their sacrifice, the role of Ireland and the 10,000 Irishmen who served in the Royal Navy in WW1 will be marked as part of the Battle of Jutland commemorations.
The commemorations will take place in a special cross-border event in Belfast onboard a ship that took part in the battle.
HMS Caroline, launched in 1914, is the venue for a gathering of sailors from the present day Royal Navy and the Republic of Ireland's Naval Service, relatives of Irishmen who served at sea in the war, as well as representatives of the UK and Irish governments.
The 200 invited guests will hear tribute speeches as well as readings from letters sent from the sailors to their families back in Ireland.
Among them will be Marie McCarthy, whose grandfather, Daniel Fitzgerald from Cork, was a stoker on HMS Tiger.
He recalled hearing horrific sounds and sights during the sinking of the Queen Mary at Jutland.
It sank with the entire crew of more than 1,100 on board, lost to the deep.
Also remembered will be those killed on HMS Hawke, which was primarily crewed by Irishman, and that was sunk by a U-Boat with the loss of 524 men.
Among them was leading stoker Joyce Power, who left young twins and a pregnant wife in Ballymena.
His daughter, Margaret Hawke Power, was named after the ship on which he was killed.
One of the few survivors recalled: ""The crew for the most part were Irishmen, the reason being that at the outbreak of war the Hawke, which was one of the oldest ships of the British Navy, was stationed at Queenstown.
""There were only around 24 active servicemen on board, the remainder being fleet reservists.""
Another relative who'll be at the commemoration event to mark a family sacrifice is Mark Doherty from Belfast, whose great uncle died at Jutland.
Patrick Joseph Doherty was from a rural area near Coleraine, County Londonderry.
He was the ninth of 11 children and volunteered for the navy in 1915, dying just 18 months later on HMS Lion.
Mark said his great uncle's role below decks was unbelievably tough.
""He was a stoker, it was an extremely dirty environment and removed from what was on deck and going on outside. It was a very gruelling experience.
""This ship carried 3,500 tons of coal and that all had to be shifted.
""On that day, the fleet he was part of approached the Germans at speed. His role was to shovel coal as fast as possible to help the speed and they then engaged in battle,"" said Mark.
""Patrick's ship was one of the first to encounter the Germans and the engagement was ferocious.
""HMS Queen Mary was directly in front of the Lion and it was hit , blew up and sank within view of Lion.
""Patrick's ship was targeted then and there is a picture of the Queen Mary going down whilst great plumes of water can be seen around HMS Lion caused by the German shells.
""It received a number of direct hits and was only saved from sinking when a young seaman deliberately flooded an area which was on fire killing himself and several others as a way of saving the ship.
""I can only speculate that during that exchange it was one of those shells that killed my great uncle,"" said Mark, who has spent time researching the battle since hearing of his family involvement.
In all, 99 men died on HMS Lion and 51 others were injured, but the vessel stayed afloat to fight again.
Like the others, Patrick Joseph Doherty was buried at sea, but his name is marked on a number of memorials including the war memorial in Coleraine.

44634,"Are Manchester United right to sack David Moyes? As David Moyes’s reign unravelled on Monday, tales emerged of senior Manchester United  players beating a path to the door of Sir Alex Ferguson’s Cheshire home to urge their old manager to push for change. The message was clear: they no longer stood by Moyes and neither should United if the empire Ferguson built was not going to continue crumbling, brick by brick. There was no more staunch a supporter of Moyes than his fellow Scot. After all, it was Ferguson who had called the Everton manager away from a shopping trip with his wife, Pamela, to that same address in Wilmslow to offer him the job last May when the ill-fated legend of ‘The Chosen One’ was born. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch David Moyes . Scot to trot: David Moyes tenure as United manager was ended after players complained to Fergie . Time's up! Sir Alex Ferguson played a major part in electing Moyes as his successor . SOS: United are desperate to return to winning ways after their worst season in Premier League history . ‘To be honest, it was done when Alex said but it was good for me to meet David and hear his ideas and plans,’ claimed United chief Ed Woodward in an interview last October, in what could now be seen as an attempt to distance himself from the appointment as the storm clouds gathered. ‘Without the recommendation of Alex there may have been a different process.’ Moyes reminded us of that episode last Friday, at what proved to be his final pre-match press conference, as he revisited the story of his departure from Everton. It was never going to be an easy transition. When Ferguson stood on the Old Trafford turf as United boss for the last time on that May day and urged supporters to back the new manager through good times and bad — even before his successor had been confirmed — he could see trouble ahead. It is a sign of just how much Ferguson is . revered that the fans obeyed him through the most wretched of seasons, . even when the banner dedicated to Moyes in the Stretford End became a . focal point of contention and then embarrassment and rebel planes . started circling overhead. Great expectations: Fergie addressed Old Trafford on his final game urging them to get behind the new man . Back in the day: Man United players want to see a return to the glory days they enjoyed under Ferguson . SIR ALEX FERGUSON, MAY 2013‘We’ve had bad times here. The club stood by me. All my staff stood by me. The players stood by me. So your job now is to stand by our new manager.’SIR BOBBY CHARLTON, MAY 2013‘We have secured a man who is committed to the long term and will build teams for the future as well as now.’SIR ALEX FERGUSON, OCT 2013‘David Moyes was at Everton for 10 years. There’s evidence that sticking with a manager does help.’ED WOODWARD, OCT 2013‘We don’t want the manager to be a hired gun for the next two or three years. We want the next generation to enjoy having him there creating his own legacy.’DAVID BECKHAM, FEB 2014‘I think David Moyes is a great manager, but it takes time. There’s a transitional period.’ROY KEANE, MARCH 2014‘I think David Moyes will get plenty of time. The man deserves it.’ They never forgot how Ferguson . survived and then thrived in the early Nineties and hoped Moyes would . somehow follow a similar road to redemption. Without their patience and . understanding, he would have been toast some time ago. But . when Ferguson himself became the target for their anger in recent . weeks, when Moyes openly questioned the squad that he had inherited, and . Ferguson’s final act as manager was suddenly threatening to taint all . that had gone before, enough was enough. As . if an increasingly bleak future under Moyes wasn’t bad enough, the . whole mess was in danger of casting a cloud over their glorious past. The comparisons with Sir Matt Busby and Wilf McGuinness 44 years ago have become quite uncanny. Moyes . is a good man, a proud man, and someone who hasn’t turned into a bad . coach overnight. But Ferguson cast a long shadow and it was one he never . came close to escaping. As . much as Moyes benefited from his predecessor’s support, there is no . doubt Ferguson’s achievements became a weight around his neck, his . presence a distraction. Selection policy: Moyes was coined 'The Chosen One' after his appointment headed by Ferguson . Sign of the times: Fans vented their frustration with a fly-by protest proclaiming Moyes the 'Wrong One' Moyes . insisted Ferguson was an occasional presence, always helpful but never . intrusive; that his aura around the club was not a problem. He may think . differently in hindsight. At . least McGuinness didn’t have to sit through every match at Old Trafford . facing a stand bearing the name of the legend he had replaced, while . modern television has enabled cameras to zoom in on Ferguson’s . expression every time Moyes suffered a setback — and there were far too . many of those for comfort . Every time another black mark appeared on his record, it was compared unfavourably with the man he replaced. Is it over yet? Fergie's visits to Old Trafford became less comfortable, with some fans even turning on him . A . post-mortem into United’s failings this season was never complete . without mention of how Moyes had done away with Ferguson’s entire . backroom team last summer. Ryan Giggs joined the coaching staff, a nod to the Ferguson dynasty, but his opinion was rarely sought and barely valued. Troubled times: Manchester United's 2-0 loss to Everton at the weekend was their 11th defeat of the season . Bad to worse: David Moyes has failed to live up to expectations at Old Trafford and has paid the price . Giggs . became an increasingly despondent figure and when two of Fergie’s . ‘Class of 92’,  Paul Scholes and Gary Neville, criticised Moyes’s team . and signings on television last month it was a sign the old guard were . in rebellion. Stalwarts of the Ferguson era, such as Nemanja Vidic and . Rio Ferdinand, had long since lost faith in Moyes. Robin . van Persie made it clear from the outset he was unhappy with the . change. Danny Welbeck, one of the bright young things Ferguson left . behind, now wants out. Others simply lost direction and heart. Singing from a different sheet? Ryan Giggs joined the coaching staff but was rarely asked for input . Sir Alex was aware of the unrest. His players made sure of that when they took the issue to his front door. Having . been so instrumental in Moyes’s appointment, it is unclear what part . Ferguson played in the decision to call time or how hard he fought . to save him when the Glazer family and Woodward lost patience. Ultimately, though, it was his legacy that stood to suffer from this whole sorry affair.",Manchester United lost 2-0 to Everton at Old Trafford on Saturday. David Moyes was appointed as Sir Alex Ferguson's successor on Monday. Sir Alex Ferguson was a major part in securing Moyes's appointment. Moyes has failed to live up to expectations at Old Trafford.

69694,"The family of a seven-month-old baby, who was tortured and killed by his mother's de facto husband, has called on Immigration Minister Scott Morrison to ensure the killer is deported when he is released next week. Ex-boxer Christopher Hoerler, 37, was sentenced to 14 years and four months - after prosecutors appealed the initial term of 11 years - for the manslaughter of Jordan Anderson-Smith in Wagga Wagga in 2000. At the time of Jordan's murder, Hoerler was living de facto with Jordan's mother, Louise Anderson and Jordan's two half-brothers, who were aged 2 and 4. Hoerler has been granted parole and is expected to be released next Thursday. Jordan would have turned 15 on July 24. A photo of baby Jordan Anderson, taken shortly before his death. Christopher Hoerler tortured the seven-month-old to death in Wagga Wagga on February 25, 2000.  The Crown prosecutor found that Jordan died from multiple injuries, including bruises and abrasions to his face, a torn lip, liver and bowel damage and crushed toes - which were inflicted when Hoerler put his then-girlfriend's son's toes in a clamp. Christopher Hoerler will be released from prison on August 14 for the brutal murder of baby Jordan. Jordan's family are petitioning, to ensure Hoerler will be deported upon his release. Baby Jordan died following a party at which his mother and her live-in boyfriend were drinking and smoking cannabis at their home in Wagga Wagga, NSW on February 25, 2000. Hoerler was tried for murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter 20 months after Jordan was killed. Jordan choked on his own vomit after being beaten and tortured by Hoerler, with injuries including a lacerated liver, a torn lip, facial abrasions and broken ribs. His toes had also been crushed by a clamp. The forensic pathologist who conducted the post mortem found that the baby's 'palate injury was caused by a blow to the jaw, and the abdominal injury by a non-penetrating blow or blows of considerable force'. Jordan's injuries were so extensive that they took four days to document. Jordan's father, Cecil Smith, had contacted the Department of Community Services when he believed Hoerler was showering with Jordan. While Hoerler had his visa cancelled after he was convicted, and the parole board says he will be released into the custody of Immigration officials to be deported to Papua New Guinea, the family is not convinced and want assurances from the immigration minister.

The family has launched an online petition, calling on Mr Morrison to ensure Hoerler is deported when he is released on August 14. His sentence was due to expire in February 2016. 'The Smith family are extremely disappointed in the decision the parole board has made to release this convicted child killer back into the community' a statement on the petition website said. In a statement, the State Parole Authority says in granting parole, it considered Hoerler's good prison performance and completion of programs addressing his offending behaviour.

Jordan's uncle, Darcy Smith has become the family's spokesman and is appealing to the public to support the petition and for the minister to 'step up to the plate' and ensure Hoerler is ousted. Mr Smith believes Hoerler may appeal the deportation condition of his release because he had children in Australia and wanted to be a father to them, Fairfax newspapers say. 'He is trying to pull a rabbit out of the hat to stay in the country,' Mr Smith said. 'I hope the minister is smart enough to see through that.' Previously, Mr Smith has spoken of the family's intense and unrelenting grief. 'We are the ones living with the life sentence. We have to live without Jordan every day.' They explained that their mother, Jordan's paternal grandmother, visits Jordan's grave every Sunday. The Smith family have previously explained that Hoerler had moved into the home only three weeks before he murdered Jordan. Hoerler met Ms Anderson on New Year's Eve in 1999, but by less than two months later, on February 25, 2000, he killed her son.

82823,"By . David Mccormack . and Associated  Press Reporter . Former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis will forever have a presence at Grand Central Terminal in New York City following the opening of an entrance named in her honor on Monday. The entrance at Park Avenue and East 42nd Street is a tribute to Kennedy’s important role in fighting to save the station in the 1970s when plans were at an advanced stage to build a 53-story tower built atop the iconic structure. The newly renovated entrance has being named the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Foyer and features a large plaque bronze relief of Onassis and a description of her role in saving the terminal. Jackie Onassis, pictured in 1977, stands beside a huge photo of Grand Central Station during a news conference by the Committee To Save Grand Central, to plead that the terminal be spared demolition . People walk past a plaque of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis after a ceremony on Monday to dedicate Grand Central Terminal's renovated main entry vestibule in memory of the former first lady . Her efforts led to the U.S. Supreme Court upholding the city's Landmark Law in 1978 and saving the station from having its facade and Man Waiting Room destroyed. The Beaux-Arts train terminal first opened in 1913 and by 1947, over 65 million people - the equivalent of 40 percent of the population of the United States - were traveling through it each year. Soon after the railroads fell into a major decline with competition from government subsidized highways and intercity airline traffic. In 1954, a plan was floated - then quickly abandoned - to replace the station with an 80-story structure taller than the Empire State Building. Kennedy's efforts led to the U.S. Supreme Court upholding the city's Landmark Law in 1978 and saving the station from having its facade and Man Waiting Room destroyed . 'Is it not cruel to let our city die by . degrees, stripped of all her proud monuments, until there will be . nothing left of all her history and beauty to inspire our children?'- Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, 1975 . The New York Central Railroad continued to dramatically decline and in 1968, plans were unveiled for a Marcel Breuer-designed tower to be built over Grand Central. The terminal had originally been designed to support a tower above it and Breuer’s design would have utilized the existing tower support structure but wouldn’t have preserved the facade or the Main Waiting Room. The plans drew huge opposition, particularly as the orate Pennsylvania Station had been demolished in 1964 despite pleas to preserve it. One of the most prominent supporters of the campaign to save Grand Central was Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Her efforts included a handwritten letter in 1975 urging then Mayor Abe Beame not to give up in a court battle to defeat the development plan.

50002,"Although the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, David Gauke, suggested to the BBC that the government had gone far enough on raising taxes on the self-employed, any companies that use self-employed workers should start looking down the back of the sofa for some money.
Uber and Deliveroo - the Treasury is on your case.
Philip Hammond regularly cites evidence that the growth of self-employment is undermining the tax base - by between Â£3.5bn and Â£5bn a year by 2020 potentially.
The self-employed tend to be lower paid and also still pay, even with the tax increases, a lower level of national insurance compared to the 12% paid by full-time employees.
Those who are self-employed point out that they are in a much more precarious employment and have often decided to take a risk as entrepreneurs.
And they do not receive pension contributions and entitlements such as holiday pay, which are rights for those directly employed by companies.
Oddly, the government decided to raise taxes on the self-employed first, rather than tackle the advantages gained by companies that use self-employed workers.
Those firms often pay lower levels of national insurance and do not pay pension contributions.
Mr Gauke admitted the area was ""more complicated"" - but gave a clear signal that action would be taken.
Later this year, Matthew Taylor, the head of the Royal Society of Arts, will produce his report for the government on the world of work.
It is expected to call for a better ""balance"" between the treatment of employed and self-employed workers, in terms of both tax and rights.
It is likely Mr Hammond will use that as a trigger point for major changes to the tax and rights treatment of the self-employed and those who employ them.","The government has not been able to tackle the problem of the self-employed, but it has taken steps to tackle the problem."
5126,"With huge respect to the materials they use, they labour -  their hands determining the utility, beauty or eatability of the things that slowly emerge from their work.
It is a real privilege to run into this craftsmanship in making business programmes, which are so often about companies and corporate behaviour.
Craftspeople you encounter in all sorts of circumstances, such as a New Zealand special effects movie workshop, or on farms and vineyards in many parts of the world.
For example, in the fields of Uttar Pradesh, in India, cowpats saved for fuel are stored in huts built from the same material, and then imprinted with variously arranged handprints, for decoration.
There are craftsmen here in a fish and chip shop in central London, where I am writing this in longhand as the team fries up a wondrous plate of plaice and chips with the same skill they have been demonstrating for at least 40 years.
Craftspeople have much to teach the mass producers and the advertising agencies. They take what they do very seriously, and they take the individuals they are doing it for seriously as well - otherwise known as customers.
I was recently in the Italian city of Cremona, a world centre for the making of string instruments for the past 500 years or more, and still home to a cluster of top luthiers, as the Italians term them.
Here you see the potency of craftsmanship at work, and the power of the cluster of likeminded people to create a longstanding business entity.
It all started a long time ago. Cremona in the Middle Ages was one of a succession of wealthy Italian cities with courts, whose ruling families employed professional musicians.
There was a demand for music, and it was rewarded. Craftsmanship was respected, and from it emerged a great tradition.
In Cremona in the middle of the 16th Century, the instrument maker Andrea Amati is credited with producing an entirely new model of fiddle, with a much more evocative sound than its medieval predecessors.
Then, in the second half of the 17th Century, came Antonio Stradivari, another local instrument maker. His achievements became stellar.
In his long working life, Stradivari built more than 1,000 violins, violas and cellos. He achieved sound and musical expressiveness that many of the world's best performers think can never be equalled.
The weather, or rather the climate, may have quite a lot to do with Stradivari's mastery of his craft. Violins are best made from two different woods - stripy grained spruce for the top, or soundboard, and maple for the back.
The century before Stradivari started making instruments may have produced the perfect growing climate for the trees in the high forests of Italy's Dolomites mountain range, from where Cremona's violin makers bought their wood.
A sequence of what appear to be abnormally long cold winters meant the trees grew slowly and steadily. When finally cut, their wood proved to be of exceptional resonance.
Stradivari died in 1737 at the age of 93, but the tradition lived on.
Cremona became one of those now fashionable and desirable economic and geographic entities - a cluster of craft enterprise. Luthiers, trained under master practitioners, won a reputation for their work for others, and then set up workshops on their own.
Buyers came to Cremona because they would have a choice of instruments - some wonderful, some average, at various prices.
You knocked on the door of a shop or a workshop, were overwhelmed by the craftsmanship employed behind the scenes, played a few instruments, chose one, came back the next day to reassure yourself, agreed payment terms, and eventually took it home.
In many respects, the experience cannot have changed very much over the centuries. Authenticity, tradition, skill, the sensuous smells of wood being shaved and shaped, and then the varnish.
This all went on for decade after decade - masters, apprentices, workshops doing everything by hand, and basking in the glow of the ultimate Cremonese master, Antonio Stradivari.
In the late 1930s, the city established a school to teach the basics of the craft. It is today thriving, with dozens of students on a five-year course who come from all over the world. Italian students are now in a minority.
They learn how to make or restore violins, and then complete their learning process in a master's established workshop, often in the city.
Then, making their reputation instrument by instrument, they often then stay on in Cremona for the rest of their lives. At the very least, it's a nice, quiet, small place to live.
Violin making (like so much craftsmanship) is a lonely job. But the city lives and breathes violins, from the sensuous forms of string instruments cases in the posh workshop windows, to the violin-shaped confectionery in old-fashioned sweetshops down ancient alleyways - originally Roman streets.
And the luthiers love showing off their instruments to would-be purchasers.
It is very moving when the man who has created the violin takes it down from its resting place, picks up the bow, and lovingly coaxes from it the harmonies he intended it to produce when he first took a chisel to the maple.
Then there is the serendipity of the cluster. They meet in the street or the bar, these makers - they gossip, they confer. In recent years they've been taking action to enhance the city's international reputation.
The established luthiers have set up the Consorzio Liutai Antonio Stradivari Cremona.
In essence, this consortium is a revival of the mediaeval guild idea, enabling its members to issue certificates of authenticity for their individual instruments.
""Made in Cremona"" is not a guarantee of quality, but is policed by a group with a strong vested interest in not allowing anyone to let the side down.
You might think that the market for new violins costing 20,000 euros ($27,000; Â£16,000) or more would be a pretty steady one, but over the past 20 years it has been transformed by the rise of a new marketplace for Western music in Asian countries - particularly China and Japan.
There are now millions of new string instrument learners, and some of them want quite expensive new instruments with a heritage and a history. They come to Cremona, or Cremona goes to them. The luthiers have learnt how to find dealers far from home by going to trade fairs in faraway places.
While I was in the workshop of a leading maker - originally from Colombia, as it happened, but Cremonese by decades of adoption - into the shop came a Japanese mother and her little girl, looking for a 25,000 euro violin. The language of music is becoming universal.
Today Cremona may not be making the finest instruments in the world, as once it most certainly did. Experts tell me there are finer lone craftspeople in Germany, for example.
But assessing an instrument is a very subjective thing.
My brief stay in Cremona was a vivid reminder of the value of craft and the handmade in a world which now prizes superbly mass-produced goods, and instant networks of friends and communication.
Individuality is an important component of being human. Craftspeople have wonderfully individual stories to tell about the things they make, slowly and carefully. In an industrialised world, they still have a lot to tell us about being properly human.
Peter Day reports from Cremona for In Business on BBC Radio 4 on Thursday, 28 August at 20:30 BST, repeated on Sunday, 31 August at 21:30 BST.","It's a city where the craftspeople are - the people who make the instruments, the people who make them, the people who make them, the people who make them, the people who make them, the people who make them, the people who make them, the people who make them, the people who make them, the people who make them, the people who make them, the people who make them, the people who make them, the people who make them, the people who make them, the people who make them, the people who make them."

24432,"By . Carol Davis . Graham Parker took part in a trial using stem cells to repair heart damage . A major new trial is using patients' own stem cells to treat heart . failure. One  of the first to benefit is Graham Parker, 41, an . archaeology student from Stanley, County Durham. He tells CAROL DAVIS . his story. Working as a supply teacher a few years . ago, I started feeling exhausted. I couldn't walk more than 50 metres . without pausing, was constantly breathless and would wake at night . coughing. At first I thought it was a cold or flu, or the stress of a . house move. But my mum, a retired nurse, pointed out I'd been ill for . two months, and sent me to the doctor. The GP suspected asthma, and . gave me an inhaler. But within a week it was worse and I couldn't walk . more than a few yards without retching. So I saw a second GP. She didn't say what she thought it was - she called an ambulance instead. I . was admitted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead, then . transferred to the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle while they ran several . tests, including an ECG (electrocardiogram) and MRI (magnetic resonance . imaging) scan. Doctors explained I had heart failure: part of my . heart muscle was damaged and the lower pumping chamber had become flabby . so couldn't pump blood round my body properly. This was why I was so . exhausted. It could have been caused by a virus, although sometimes . it's genetic. But there's no family history of heart disease and I was . very fit - I was a former policeman - so the diagnosis was a real shock. I . left hospital with medication to help my heart, including beta blockers . to relieve the load on the heart, ACE inhibitors to dilate my blood . vessels and help the heart pump better, as well as diuretics and . warfarin to thin the blood and stop it clotting. The risk with heart . failure is that blood can pool in the heart's chambers and is more . likely to clot, which can cause a heart attack. I had to take six . months off work, and felt incredibly weak and breathless. As my heart . was permanently damaged, I had a pacemaker and defibrillator implanted . the following year to keep my heart beating regularly. This stopped me getting any worse, but I was still weak. I couldn't run more than ten minutes on the treadmill at the gym. Stem cells were taken from the bone marrow in Graham's hip, and injected into his heart . I'd . read online that many heart failure patients die within five years, . which was a terrifying prospect. So I gave up work and started an . archaeology degree, which I'd always wanted to do. Then, in June . 2009 I read in Good Health about a woman with a damaged heart valve . who'd had a new treatment in Germany to have stem cells injected into . the valve to repair it. A trial using stem cells to treat heart . failure was starting at the London Chest Hospital and I asked to join . it. The doctors explained that stem cells can potentially grow into any . cell, including heart muscle cells, for reasons doctors don't yet fully . understand. Stem cells would be taken from the bone marrow in my hip, and injected into my heart. The . treatment started in December 2010 and involved me first having a daily . injection of a protein that stimulates the bone marrow for five days. I then had a local anaesthetic while doctors used a large syringe to take bone marrow from my hip. This . was then sent to the lab to have the stem cells removed. Later that . day, I was given a local anaesthetic and sedated for the hour-long . procedure, to transplant the stem cells. The consultant, Professor . Anthony Mathur, fed a thin flexible tube up through the artery in my . thigh to my heart, then fed the fluid containing the stem cells into it. At first I felt no different. Since it was a trial, I knew some . patients would have stem cells and the rest a placebo. But over the next . few years I felt better and better. Eventually, I was able to run for more than an hour on the treadmill, far more than I'd managed in police training. I suspected I'd had the stem cells and last July Professor Mathur confirmed it - I was elated but not surprised. Now, . six years after my diagnosis, I do six miles of Nordic walking - . trekking using poles - every other day, have climbed mountains, have . more stamina than people half my age and my breathing is back to normal. I'm still classed as having heart failure and still take my medication but feel completely better -it's life-changing. It's relatively safe and the risk is similar to what people experience in an angioplasty and stent procedure . Professor . Anthony Mathur is a consultant cardiologist at Barts Health  NHS Trust . in London and professor of cardiology at Queen Mary University of . London. Heart disease is Britain's biggest killer, with 103,000 heart attacks in the UK annually. But . since we are getting better at treating heart attacks there are now . more than a million people living with heart failure, when the heart can . no longer pump sufficient blood around the body. It causes . breathlessness because the heart does not supply blood to other organs . properly. This is especially noticeable in the lungs. Doctors can try . treating heart failure with medication to help heart function, or by . fitting a pacemaker and defibrillator to help it beat properly. But . for the past ten years I have worked with the Heart Cells Foundation, . which has helped fund the Regenerate trials. These have treated . different groups of patients with their stem cells. Some patients . had had a recent heart attack, others had heart failure caused by heart . disease or by a virus (which probably happened in Graham's case). The . trials produced significant results. Following the trials' success, . we are now involved in the world's largest ever trial of stem cell . therapy in heart attack patients. The BAMI study will treat 3,000 . patients across Europe to see if administering stem cells within a few . days of a heart attack will prolong life by helping repair the heart and . keeping it working properly. We use stem cells taken from bone . marrow - a good source, and a well-tested procedure. Heart failure . patients begin with five days of injections of a growth factor, but in . the BAMI trial we don't do this because we want to treat them soon after . the heart attack. We then take 50-100ml of bone marrow from their . hip, which is processed to collect white blood cells, which contain the . stem cells. A catheter - a thin flexible tube - is inserted through . the artery in the groin to the main artery to the heart; we also inject a . dye so we can see the coronary arteries supplying the heart on an . X-ray.Then we feed the catheter into the coronary arteries - before . we inject the stem cells, we inflate a tiny balloon to block the artery . so the cells will not flow back out. Some cells will be flushed out, . but we hope some will find their way to the damaged heart muscle and . help to repair it, which takes six to 12 months. Results from the . Regenerate trials have already shown we can help patients with damaged . hearts. We hope the newest trial will show we could help many more, so . this could one day become a standard treatment after a heart attack. It's . relatively safe and the risk is similar to what people experience in an . angioplasty and stent procedure - where we open blocked arteries using a . tiny metal tube. The procedure costs the NHS about £10,000 and is . only available as part of the BAMI trial at the London Chest Hospital . run by Barts Health NHS Trust.","Stem cells taken from bone marrow in Graham Parker's hip, and injected into his heart.

74951,"A winter storm named ""Xynthia"" battered the western coast of Europe Sunday, its high winds downing trees and power lines and leaving as many as 55 people dead, authorities said. Hardest hit was France, where at least 45 people were killed, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon announced. The extra-tropical cyclone whipped the country's coastal regions and moved inland, bringing sometimes heavy flooding with it. Are you affected by the storm? Share images and information with CNN iReport. ""It's a national catastrophe,"" Fillon said in a brief news conference following an emergency meeting on the situation. ""Many people drowned, surprised by the rapid rise of the water. ""Now the priority is to bring all the people left homeless and still threatened by the rising waters to safety,"" the prime minister explained. ""All services are mobilized to reach that goal as soon as possible."" French President Nicolas Sarkozy will visit the department of Charente-Maritime Monday, Fillon said. Charente-Maritime and Vendee, on the French coast west of Paris, had severe flooding when the strong winds whipped up the water at high tide. ""At 3 o'clock in the morning, we heard the toilets backing up. We got up to look and then we saw 80 cm (about 31 inches) of water in the garage,"" a resident of Aiguillon-Sur-Mer, in the department of Vendee, told CNN affiliate BFM-TV. ""It was rushing in, it broke down the walls around the garden and the gate."" Hundreds of people had to be rescued from their rooftops overnight. ""The water was up to the gutters,"" said one woman, who spent the night on the roof with her children. Residents of the village of Aytre, in Charente-Maritime, saw a wave of water measuring 1 meter high (about 1 yard) come into the center of town.

35738,"Haiti's top prosecutor on Friday denied reports that charges have been dropped against nine of the 10 American missionaries accused of kidnapping children after a devastating earthquake hit the nation in January. Attorney General Joseph Manes was responding to news from the office of U.S. Sen Jim Risch, R-Idaho, whose staff on Thursday said the charges had been dropped against all but one of the Baptist missionaries. Group leader Laura Silsby remains in a Haitian jail. Risch spokesman Kyle Hines said the senator had been contacted by officials at the U.S. State Department, confirming that the kidnapping charges against the other nine were dropped. However, Manes said that information was ""absolutely incorrect."" He said that under Haitian law, all charges against the 10 Americans stand until the examining judge, Bernard Saint-Vil, renders his final decision on whether to proceed to trial. Risch's communications director, Brad Hoaglun, said: ""We are standing by what we were orginally told by the State Department. We did, however, ask the State Department to reconfirm for us, and we are waiting that response."" A senior State Department official told CNN Friday the charges were dropped, but deferred questions to Haiti's government, saying ""this was a Haitian decision."" On Thursday, Saint-Vil could not be reached for comment and Manes declined to respond to CNN's questions until he could do so in person on Friday. Authorities in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, accused the group, many of whom belong to a Baptist church in Idaho, of trying to kidnap 33 Haitian children after an earthquake in January leveled much of the capital and surrounding areas. The Rev. Clint Henry of the Central Valley Baptist Church said the missionaries were notified by a State Department e-mail that the charges were dropped and no other charges were pending. Meanwhile, Manes said his office received the documents pertaining to Saint-Vil's investigation and that his staff has five days to derive an opinion, which will remain confidential, on whether to move forward on a trial or dismiss the charges. At that point the case will be returned to the judge for a final decision. The 10 Americans have said they were trying to help the children get to a safe place after the magnitude-7.0 earthquake. Haitian authorities stopped the group on January 29 as they tried to cross the border with the children without proper legal documentation. The group said it was going to house the children in a converted hotel in the Dominican Republic and later move them to an orphanage. Silsby originally claimed the children were orphaned or abandoned, but the Haitian government and the orphans' charity SOS Children say that all have at least one living parent. Some said they placed their children in Silsby's care because that was the only way they knew to ensure a better quality of life. Eight of the missionaries were released from custody in February and a ninth, Charisa Coulter of Boise, Idaho, was released in March. One of the missionaries told CNN affiliate KTKA on Thursday that the news of charges being dropped against him and the others was bittersweet. ""It's partial good news,"" Drew Culberth said. ""It's good for me but not good news for [Laura] Silsby."" CNN's Lonzo Cook contributed to this report.","Haiti's top prosecutor denies reports that charges have been dropped against nine of 10 missionaries. Sen.

33203,"She was the first rape victim in the UK to waive her anonymity, and went on to help hundreds - if not thousands - of women cope with their experiences.
After her death on 5 January, two women who were comforted by the mother-of-three after their lives were shattered by devastating sexual attacks, talk about the impact she had.
Clare, not her real name, said her daughter was attacked in broad daylight in 2012. The offender has never been caught.
She said she saw her daughter go from being confident and happy to frightened and introverted.
But they found Ms Saward, from Hednesford in Staffordshire, to be ""consistently supportive"" - which has led to her daughter changing her career choice to follow in her footsteps as an advocate for women who have been raped.
""I knew Jill, because my daughter was sexually attacked several years ago, and around the time this happened, I heard Jill being interviewed on the radio and remembered what had happened to her well.
""I sent her a message saying how inspiring and helpful I had found listening to her and telling her about my daughter, and also saying how brilliantly I thought the radio interview had gone.
""To my surprise Jill responded to me immediately, and so openly and humbly that I was moved to tears.""
Ms Saward told her she did not always feel confident being interviewed, feeling self-conscious and inadequate, and that she was grateful for Clare's positive feedback.
""Over the years I always contacted her after that, whenever I heard her on the radio, saw her on TV or read her quoted in the press or online.
""She responded each and every time, graciously and generously, and was discreetly, but consistently, supportive to us both - and this undoubtedly played no small part in our healing.
""I was absolutely devastated to hear the news of her death and mourn the loss of this wonderful woman who helped our family - amongst I'm sure, thousands of others - deal with our pain and trauma by repeatedly sharing her own pain, trauma and recovery in the public domain.
""Jill's legacy will live on in many ways.
""In our family she will always be a legendary figure, who demonstrated to us all how gentleness and humility can go hand-in-hand with bravery and boldness... and of this are the true heroes and warriors of our time made.""
Helen Austin was raped by strangers 10 years ago. Her attacker has also never been apprehended. She subsequently wrote an anonymous blog about what happened to her, which led to Ms Saward tracking her down to ""reach out"" to her.
They went on to become good friends, speaking almost daily.
""I would not be where I am now without Jill's lifeline support and friendship,"" she said.
""When I chose to come out from anonymous writing she supported me to think through the practicalities. The potential impact... on my family and friends and people who knew me, but didn't know my 'story' as such.
""She taught me that being raped is part of our story. We cannot lose that.
""It will never not be part of our lives now, but we can move forward - not let it be our only identity.""
When she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder a few years ago, she said Ms Saward encouraged her to have progressional counselling and to talk to her mother about her rape - which was only last year, because she had wanted to ""protect"" her from it.
""Jill has taught me so much about who I am and what I can do with my voice.""
She said she was struck by the warmth and humour of a woman who had done ""groundbreaking"" work to take the stigma away from rape victims.
""There would be times when we would be having really deep conversations, and then she would just say something that would lighten the tension,"" she said.
""As I moved forward with my story, Jill was always a constant encouragement.""
Ms Saward's husband, Gavin Drake, said his wife's help for Ms Austin was typical of her helping hand away from the cameras and campaigning.
""She enjoyed giving joy and fun to people,"" he said.
""What's emerged in the week or so since Jill's death is just the amount of people that she was communicating with, victims and others she was supporting.
""We've received thousands of messages from people across the world who've said about how these messages and these conversations that she was having online, which I didn't know about because the nature of her work of course is confidential.
""I knew she was doing it, but even I had no idea the extent of the number of people she was supporting.""
Alison Boydell co-founded the JURIES campaign group with Ms Saward, which tries to educate jurors on the stereotypes that can surround rape cases.
The pair initially engaged on social media in 2014 where they would have ""heated debates"" and vent their frustrations at the low conviction rates of those accused of rape, citing a need to educate jurors ""about the realities of rape and sexual violence"". This led them to form their charity.
""I've known about her and admired her from afar from the late 1980s and 90s,"" she said.
""I found her, and still find her, to be an incredibly courageous and inspiring woman and indefatigable, brave, honest.""
After the attack at her father's vicarage, Ms Saward was subsequently labelled the Ealing vicarage rape victim. But she said she made no complaint about the tag as it enabled her to challenge politicians, something Ms Boydell praised her for.
""The way she spoke about her own rape and the way that she challenged politicians and really kept sexual violence and rape on the political agenda was absolutely amazing,"" she said.
""When I got to meet her, it was just a delight... because there was so much more to her.
""She had a fantastic sense of humour, an amazing sense of irony - really great friend, incredibly supportive. She supported a lot of people individually and is going to be sorely missed.""
Her sudden death at 51 from a stroke was ""tragic"" but Ms Boydell said her decision to donate her organs was ""an amazing gift"", showing how selfless she was right up to the end.","Jill Saward, who was a vicarage rape victim, has died at the age of 51."

14016,"Chancellor Phillip Hammond is expected to announce policies in the Autumn Statement aimed at tackling the problem.
In January, then Prime Minister David Cameron said government would step in and directly commission thousands of new affordable homes.
He pledged £1.2bn over the next five years to build affordable starter homes.
But what do we mean by affordable?
The government's definition when it comes to renting is that affordable homes should cost no more than 80% of the average local market rent.
When it comes to home ownership, it is a little less clear-cut.
The government definition of affordable housing states it must be provided at a level at which the mortgage payments on the property should be more than would be paid in rent on council housing, but below market levels.
That is clearly a very broad range.
It must also be able to remain at an affordable price for future eligible households.
The starter homes announced earlier in the year will be sold with at least a 20% discount on market value, but these are reserved for first-time buyers under the age of 40.
It is not the first time a politician has targeted this group.
In 2004, then Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott announced plans to build homes for just £60,000.
Eight of the 10 planned developments were completed, but the houses were sold for far more than promised - an average of £231,000 in one development.
Others have attempted to come up with a definition of affordability for people at any age and in any living situation.
Housing charity Shelter says affordable housing should cost no more than 35% of your household income after tax and benefits.
The charity acknowledges, however, that 35% of your income will be more difficult for people on very low incomes to pay than for those who earn more.
Shelter, like most organisations attempting to come up with a definition of affordability, has looked broadly at the relationship between household income and spending on housing.
But that does not give you the whole picture in terms of what larger or less well off households can afford to pay.
A single person living in a flat and taking home £1,500 a month, for example, can pay £525 in rent, leaving them with just under £1,000 to live on.
But clearly this £1,000 would not stretch as far for a single-income, two-parent family with three children.
A room in a flat share at about £500 a month may be affordable and appropriate for that single person.
It is also technically affordable for the family of five, but it does not constitute appropriate accommodation.
Equally, a family of four paying 35% of a household income of £6,500 a month still has £4,225 left to pay for food, utilities, leisure and so on.
The same-sized family earning a total of £1,500 a month has £975 left.
The government in 2007 used 25% of gross income as the figure for what was affordable.
According to figures from building society Nationwide, in 2016 the average UK mortgage payment was 34.5% of take-home pay.
This figure has remained fairly consistent since 2009.
How affordable home ownership is to you also depends heavily on where you live.

19432,"By . Simon Tomlinson . Last updated at 5:59 PM on 18th November 2011 . Douglas Tompkins is not one to shy away from a challenge. It is a trait that has seen the businessman-turned-environmentalist rise from high school drop-out to multi-millionaire in a career that has been as diverse as it has been successful. Now the 68-year-old founder of outdoor clothing firm North Face and women's fashion chain Esprit looks as though he may close to realising another dream - his long-held and passionate attempts to create a vast nature reserve in Argentina. Green aspirations: North Face and Esprit founder Douglas Tompkins at his property in Ibera, Argentina, in 2009 where he wants to donate 370,000 acres of land to the government to create a new national park . Need for preservation: A group of caymans in Laguna Ibera at the Esteros del Ibera, which is thought to be the second-largest wetland system in the world. It is, however, coming under increasing pressure from agriculture . It is a quest that has provoked fierce criticism from the South American country's inhabitants, most notably that of Land Minster Luis Delia, who, three years ago, described him as a 'gringo imperialist' after Mr Tompkins had bought up huge amounts of land for conservation work. Mr Delia even promised to expropriate his holdings over fears he was a threat to national sovereignty. But since the death of populist president Nestor Kirchner, there has been a warming of relations. This week, Mr Tompkins announced his intention to donate 370,000 acres of his land on the Esteros del Ibera wetlands in the province of Correntes, worth £120million, to the country in a bid to create a new national park. Mixed use: The Esteros del Ibera lies in Argentina's sub-tropical far north. it consists of some protected land, Mr Tompkins's estates and areas largely privately owned for agriculture . Conserving nature: The wetlands are home to more than 4,000 different species, including capybaras (pictured) and anacondas. If the area became a national park, Mr Tompkins's non-profit group would re-introduce several animals previously wiped out there . It is hoped the park would protect . the wetlands, the second-largest in the world, from farming and . agriculture. Mr Tompkins's non-profit group The Conservation Land . Trust (CLT) would also attempt to re-introduce species previously wiped out . from the area. The 3.2million-acre reserve is afforded only limited protection as nearly half the area is divided into farms. The North Face brand was established in San Francisco in 1966 when Douglas Tompkins and Kenneth Klopp created an equipment retail store that went on to acquire the famous name. The name came about because the north face of a mountain in the northern hemisphere is usually the most challenging to climb. It began as a mail order and retail company and in the early years was a leader in the design of sleeping bags and tents. Tompkins and his partner designed the pioneering North Face tents which did away with the need for a pole in the middle by using bendable rods. Tompkins sold The North Face in 1969 for $50,000 to focus on adventure film making and later to launch Esprit. The company logo (pictured) was designed by David Alcorn in 1971 and consists of a quarter-circle with two lines running within it next to the name. Continuing to thrive, the company hopes to double its turnover to $3billion over the next five years. However, . the deal has to break through one last barrier - that of Corrientes . Governor Ricardo Colombi, who fiercely opposes the plan because he . believes it would put the local farmers out of business. It . was hoped Mr Colombi's administration might be persuaded to hand over the 1.36million . acres it holds to the national government. But Mr Tompkins and the current president, . Cristina Kirchner will now wait and see if Mr . Colombi's successor, set to replace him in 2013, is more supportive. 'It . is a political issue, between the national and regional governments. It . is not our responsibility,' CLT spokeswoman Marian Labourt told The . Independent. Mr Tompkins was born in Ohio in . 1943 to an antiques dealer and decorator and raised in Millbrook, New . York, a summer resort for Manhattan's elite. After . dropping out of high school, he moved to California where he attempted . to make it onto the US ski team for the 1964 Winter Olympics. Around the same time, he set up the California Mountaineering Guide Service. He failed to be picked, so he decided to turn his hand to another talent - business and design. Soon . after, he founded The North Face with Kenneth Klopp in San Francisco as a . mail order and retail company specialising in rock climbing and camping . equipment before selling it a few years later for $50,000. In 1968, Mr Tompkins then teamed up with Susie to create a dress-making company, selling clothes out of the back of a VW bus. That company would become Esprit, which by 1978 was enjoying sales in excess of $100million a year. Green team: Mr Tompkins with his second and current wife, Kristine, with whom he has helped to conserve more than two million acres of wilderness in Chile and Argentina . But . by the 1980s, when Esprit was flying even higher, Mr Tompkins had a . change of outlook, which he later explained, saying: 'Fashion is one of the most . intellectually vacuous industries. 'We . had to manufacture desires to get people to buy our products. We were . selling people countless things that they didn't need.' Fashion fix: Mr Tompkins set up Esprit with his first wife in 1968. They started out by selling clothes off the back of a bus . He . sold his share of the American company in 1989 back to Susie, from whom . he had separated, and has since devoted his $150m fortune to buying up . vast swathes of land in Chile and Argentina. Mr Tompkins moved to south Chile, where he devoted much of his time to land conservation and environmental activism. He founded the Foundation for Deep . Ecology in 1990, which supports environmental activism, and The . Conservation Land Trust in 1992, which works to protect wildlands, . primarily in Chile and Argentina. In 1993, he married Kristine Tompkins (nee McDivitt) and the two have worked together on their conservation projects. They have spent about millions buying two dozen properties covering 2.2million acres in the two South American countries. His land donations helped to establish the Pumalin and Corcovado National Parks in Chile, preventing loggers from cutting through the ancient woodland. But he has not been without his critics as many locals began to speculate about this American's motives. Some claims were outlandish, such as him wanting to create a nuclear dumping ground, while others speculated that he wanted to seize control of water supplies. Antonio Horvath, a conservative senator for southern Chile once said: 'If I were to go to the United States and buy a big area of Florida as an environmental preserve and tell people they can't go here or there, I think the U.S. would kick me right out of there.' El Litoral, the regional newspaper in Corrientes, once described Mr Tompkins's projects as 'tentacles' wrapping around Ibera. You will have to what this space to see if Mr Tompkins's latest venture is a manageable ascent or a cliff face that's just too steep to climb.","Douglas Tompkins, 68, set up clothing brand Esprit in 1968.

36148,"By . Katy Winter . While most people like to blame fast food restaurants like McDonald's for any extra pounds they might be carrying, one overweight man found working for the company actually helped him slim down. Colin Moore, 27, of Spennymoor in County Durham, was so worried when his weight hit 24st that he asked doctors for gastric bypass surgery. He was told he would be put on a waiting list and, faced with a long delay, decided to begin a regular diet. Colin dropped from 24st 7lb (left) to 14st 7lb (right) just through changing his diet . After losing 8st, he began working at McDonald’s where, ironically, being around fast food all day gave him the motivation he needed to reach his target weight. He said: 'I was dangerously overweight and needed to do something about it. I thankfully lost the weight myself so didn’t need a gastric band. 'Working at McDonald’s put me off the burgers, helping me reach my final goal.' Mr Moore was not overweight as a young boy but when he was ten years old he began getting bullied at school, which led to him hiding in his house and eating for comfort. He said: 'I wouldn’t go out and play and instead stayed at home. So I got bigger, which meant I was bullied more. Colin struggled with his weigh from a young age, being bullied at school because of his size which caused him to continue overeating, reaching over 20st (left) before losing nearly half his body weight (right) 'When I started secondary school the kids started called me The Penguin, like Danny DeVito from the Batman film. 'I suffered from depression and anxiety. As I grew up I wouldn’t go out, I didn’t work and I wouldn’t socialise. 'As I’ve grown up it’s always been in my mind. My weight loss has been for myself, but also to prove those bullies wrong.' In 2012, when Mr Moore was 22st, his uncle died from a smoking-related illness. He said: 'The shock urged me to stop smoking but within five months I had gained another two stone.' Mr Moore ballooned to over 24st 7lb and went to doctors in May 2013, hoping to be referred for a gastric bypass. He said: . 'I had lied to myself for a long time and refused to believe that I was . so big. When I was weighed and knew it for certain I knew I had to do . something drastically. 'I felt a gastric bypass was the only option. It was laziness though - I was taking the easy option.' He was . told by doctors that although he was eligible for the procedure, he . would need to join a long waiting list. Motivated by a desire to turn . his life around, Mr Moore began dieting. Mr . Moore said: 'I have never looked back since that day. I cut out all of . the rubbish foods such as crisps, biscuits and fizzy pop. 'I got a beautiful dog called Buddy. He’s a springer spaniel who needs constant walking - so that keeps me moving.' Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Two burgers and chips . Dinner: Whole meat feast pizza . Snacks: Crisps, sweets and 2litres coke . Breakfast: Fruit . Lunch: Ham sandwich and rice cakes . Dinner: Chicken and vegetables . Snacks: Has eliminated fizzy drinks . In his first month Mr Moore lost 18lb. Between May and November 2013 he lost a further 8st and dropped from a 46- to a 38-inch waist. Mr Moore said: 'It gave me confidence to go outside. I wasn’t working at the time and it gave me the confidence to go out and get the job at McDonald’s.' Working surrounded by the smell of burgers overloaded Mr Moore’s senses and put him off fast food completely. Mr Moore’s weight continued to drop off and he lost another two stone while working at the fast food restaurant. Mr Moore, who still works at McDonald’s, . said: 'It helped with the weight loss. Since I have worked there I . haven’t eaten any burgers. You get a free employee meal as standard, but . I choose not to eat it. Colin shows off his weight loss in an old T-shirt (left), his waist has shrunk from 46in to 38in. Walking his dog Buddy (right) helps keep Colin active and moving . 'I have nothing against McDonald’s but I like the way I am now and I know if I ate the burgers there’s no way I would stay at this weight.' Before beginning his weight loss, he typically ate nothing for breakfast, then two burgers with chips for lunch. For dinner he would often eat whole meat feast pizzas to himself from his local takeaway, and would snack on beef crisps, sweets and a two litre bottle of full fat coke. Today, he . typically eats a piece of fruit for his breakfast. For lunch he will . have a ham salad sandwich with rice cakes. For dinner he now goes for . the healthy option of chicken with boiled vegetables or a healthy curry. He has also cut the fizzy drinks out of his diet. Now . only 14st 7lb, he has lost so much weight that he dropped a shoe size . due to the loss of body fat. His waist has dropped to size 34. People who . Mr Moore has known for years now walk past him in the street as he is . so unrecognisable in his new form, and he says that losing so much weight has given him a new lease on life. He said: 'I’m more confident and outgoing, I actually want to be around people now. 'I enjoy going out and shopping because I can now find things which fit.' Colin shows off his weight loss in his old T-shirt. His waist has shrunk from 46in to 38in .","Colin dropped from 24st 7lb to 14st 7lb in just one month.

59539,"Tom Bennett said he aimed to tackle behaviour such as swinging on chairs, making silly comments or passing notes.
In a blog, he said he would form a working group that would represent ""as many ages and stages as necessary"".
He said he did not want ""monastic silence"" but classrooms need to ""run on rules that aim for the benefit of all"".
The appointment is one of several new education measures being announced on Tuesday.
The government is also setting out changes to the GCSE exam regime, covering mandatory key academic subjects and a new grading system.
Last year, low-level persistent disruptive behaviour was highlighted as a serious problem in a report by Ofsted. The watchdog said some pupils could be losing up to an hour of learning each day.
Mr Bennett, who taught in London's East End for 10 years, said it was an issue ""we still haven't licked yet"".
""Knowing how to run a room, to design an environment that promotes thought, collaboration and focus, should be one of the uppermost aims of any educator,"" he said.
""Some absurdists claim that a noisy classroom that rocks with spontaneity is the perfect crucible for learning. It isn't. For every outlier who enjoys spending time in a centrifuge, there are 29 kids who can't concentrate.""
Mr Bennett will lead the working group to develop better training for new teachers.
""At present, training teachers to anticipate, deal with and respond to misbehaviour is far too hit-and-miss - great in some schools and training providers, terrible in others,"" he said.
""Parents and children deserve safe, calm learning spaces, and teachers deserve to be equipped with sensible strategies that maximise learning, safety and flourishing.""
On his blog, Mr Bennett said he hoped the group would come up with ""recommendations that can offer new and old teachers the tools they need to do what they were trained to do"".
""I'd be lying if I said I wasn't utterly thrilled to be doing this. Just don't call me tsar, for God's sake,"" he added.
Kevin Courtney, deputy general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said ""increasing training on managing classroom behaviour is to be welcomed"".
""However, the issues which lead to the low-level disruption in class cannot be ignored,"" he said.
""The narrowing of the curriculum and constant drive towards testing leads inevitably to disaffection and boredom amongst pupils. The department's recent census shows that class sizes are rising too - overcrowded classrooms mean less teacher time for each individual pupil. ""
Mr Bennett is the latest in a string of behaviour experts brought in by governments, following Sir Alan Steer under Labour and Charlie Taylor under the coalition.
He is currently the director of researchED, a teacher-led organisation that aims ""to make teachers research-literate and pseudo-science proof"". His biography on the website says he is the author of four books on teacher-training, behaviour management and educational research.
""In his previous life he ran night clubs in Soho, which provided an obvious training ground in classroom management and pastoral care,"" it adds.",A former teacher has been appointed to lead a group to help teachers deal with low-level disruptive behaviour in classrooms.
69518,"Transport Secretary Chris Grayling says BA can lease nine Qatar A320 and 321 planes and crew after advice from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
BA will use the staffed planes to minimise flight cancellations and passenger disruption from Saturday.
The 16-day strike was prompted by what Unite union calls BA's ""poverty pay"".
The long-running industrial action concerns around 2,000 of the airline's mixed-fleet staff who, if they joined since 2010, fly short and long-haul routes mainly from Heathrow airport and earn less than cabin crew on earlier agreements.
The airline has already cancelled a small number of flights from Heathrow and merged others, but the leasing deal with Qatar means BA will be able to get the vast majority of passengers to their destinations.
A spokeswoman for the carrier said: ""We will operate 99.5% of our schedule. Our Oneworld partner, Qatar Airways, will be operating a small number of short-haul flights on our behalf.""
""We have merged a very small number of Heathrow long-haul services and all customers affected have been notified over the past week.""
The airline needed to apply for approval from Mr Grayling and the CAA had to make a recommendation to the minister because the Qatari aircraft and crew are coming in from outside the European Union.
A spokesperson for the UK Civil Aviation Authority said:  ""An application by British Airways to temporarily 'wet lease' [hiring plane and crew] nine Qatar-registered aircraft has today been approved by the UK Department for Transport.""
Unite had requested the CAA recommend blocking the wet-lease deal, claiming it broke EU regulations and cited concerns over Qatar's human rights and labour standards record.
The union brought about the unprecedented strike action because of a pay dispute and it claimed the airlines had removed concessions and perks for staff if they had taken part in previous strike action.
Unite national officer Oliver Richardson said: ""Vindictive threats from British Airways amount to corporate bullying from an airline more interested in punishing workers on poverty pay than addressing why cabin crew have been striking.""",British Airways has approved a deal to temporarily lease planes and crew from Qatar Airways.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho believes clubs which breach the rules should be docked points and stripped of any titles. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger admits he has struggled to understand Financial Fair Play rules . Wenger takes an Arsenal training session at London Colney on Monday . City were fined £49million last May, after winning the 2013-14 Barclays Premier League championship, for infringing FFP regulations, but nevertheless went on to make the biggest English outlay of the transfer window in spending £28million on striker Wilfried Bony from Cardiff. Wenger has long championed a need for football to get their finances in order. But the French coach, who studied Politics and Economics at the University of Strasbourg, has been left perplexed by just what UEFA have set out. 'It depends what you call Financial Fair Play as that notion has changed,' said Wenger. 'Is it just your income created by the gates? Is it the gates and commercial? 'Is it only the gates and the television? Is it naming rights as well? 'It is not clear to people what Financial Fair Play means, the rules are very complicated.'

Arsenal continue to move forwards from a solid financial base which is built around the revenue generated from their 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium rather than the deep pockets of American owner Stan Kroenke.

82041,"Usually, ""mapping"" is an extremely time consuming process and can take several years to complete.
New technology developed by archaeologists and engineers from Vanderbilt University, in the US, should accelerate this process.
The device will be tested later this month at the Mawchu Llacta site.
By including cameras, Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies and programming specific flight algorithms to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) developed by Aurora Flight Sciences, Professors Julie Adams and Steven Wernke hope to three-dimensionally map the archaeological site.
""To say anything about past societiesâ€”past social dynamicsâ€”we need to be able to place the material traces of past peoples in their fullest context possible.  Mapping is therefore at the core of archaeological research,"" Prof Wernke told BBC News.
Mapping areas is often labour intensive and the site where the system will be tested would usually take about six months over several years to document.
The new UAV should enable the team to map the area in minutes, once the system is perfected.
The site will be a test of the UAV's flight capabilities.
""Mawchu Llacta is located at [a] high altitude of 4,100m (13,450ft), [making it] a good site for testing the upper altitude limits of current UAV technology,"" Prof Wernke said.
Archaeologically, mapping the area will help researchers understand the area, which was once the site of one of the largest forced resettlement programs in world history, as Spanish colonials moved 1.5 million native Andeans into planned towns in the 1570s.
""[The] urban and architectural planning were at the core of what the Spanish thought they were doing to 'civilize', convert, and subjugate the native Andean populace,"" he said.
In addition to enabling the researchers to quickly detail ancient landscape features, such as canals and roads, it will also allow 3D digital versions of the sites to be created.
These, aside from assisting the process of discovery, would enable the team to ""virtually"" preserve the site.
""Given the rate of looting and destruction of archaeological sites globally, it is also exciting as a means of recording a digital archival registry,"" co-developer Prof Julie Adams explained to BBC News.
Small enough to fit in a backpack, Professor Adams hopes the device would be able to be used by any researchers.
""We seek to provide capabilities that will allow the archaeologist, non-technically oriented individuals, to deploy the system on their own without technologists and engineers,"" she said.
Tom White, a researcher at Cambridge University, appreciated this aspect of the system.
""If you could just fly this thing, it'd be a cheap way of acquiring high-resolution aerial data,"" he told BBC News.
""It would be especially useful in those places that don't have the luxury of a map network like we have here [in the UK] thanks to the Ordnance survey and the Geological survey.""","Archaeologists have developed a ""fly-by-wire"" system that will allow them to accurately map an area of the Andes."
81360,"It says an unfit care system means people often have to give up work to help the elderly or adult disabled.
The figure was calculated on the lost earnings and forgone taxes of more than 300,000 unpaid carers.
The government says its long-awaited white paper on social care is ""imminent"" and will include funding changes to ""transform care"".
Michelle Mitchell, charity director general of Age UK said: ""For many people, caring for a loved one is second nature and they wouldn't have it any other way.
""But carers should never be forced to sacrifice their own financial security and wellbeing due to the lack of service provision and support from public services.
""Care cannot wait any longer - this is the government's last chance to get it right and set their political legacy for generations to come.""
A Department of Health spokesman said: ""We agree that helping people to stay in work alongside caring not only helps carers' careers and family finances but is crucial for our workforce and economy.
""The government has committed to working together with the business community to help carers manage work and care.
""Social care reform is one of the biggest public policy challenges society faces and, in the current public spending environment, we need to make sure that we get this reform right to deliver lasting change. ""
The Age UK analysis built on work from the London School of Economics in April, adding in loss of wages to previously calculated loss from tax revenues and claimed carers' allowance.
Loss of earnings was estimated using three surveys: the carers survey - to examine the proportion of male to female, part-time to full-time carers, the labour-force survey - to calculate average earnings, and the population estimate.
On Tuesday the Local Government Association warned the rising cost of adult social care could ""soak up"" almost all of council spending by 2020.
Currently, £14.6bn is spent on adult social care services in England.
Last year the economist Andrew Dilnot was asked by ministers to look at how funding could be changed. The Dilnot Commission recommended the means-testing threshold for those needing residential care be increased to £100,000. It also called for a partnership whereby individuals pay the first chunk of their care. It recommended a cap of between £25,000 and £50,000.
Wales and Northern Ireland both have means-tested systems similar to that in England.
Scotland provides free personal care, but in recent years has started tightening the eligibility criteria for the same reasons councils in England have.","The cost of adult social care in England is expected to rise by £100,000 by 2020, Age UK has estimated."

'Recently we had shootings here, somebody killed here at LAX. There have been in the past bombing attempts,' Rubin said. 'I want and I intend to have police resources to be used in those kinds of matters. Not this.' Safe place: Marilyn Jean Hartman has a history of mental illness and has said that she feels safer in airports than on the streets . Hartman's public defender Larissa Cesareo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Hartman previously made repeated attempts to sneak aboard flights at other airports, according to authorities. Airport police spotted her at LAX without a ticket on August 7, a day after a judge placed her on probation for two years for sneaking aboard the Southwest Airlines flight from San Jose to Los Angeles. At Mineta San Jose International . Airport, Hartman tried at least three times to get to a plane before she . finally went past a security screener who was busy checking a family's . documents, law enforcement officials said. Her boarding status was discovered once the Southwest flight landed in Los Angeles, the officials said. Hartman . later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of willfully and . unlawfully entering Los Angeles as a stowaway on an aircraft. A judge . ordered her to stay away from LAX unless she had a valid ticket. Outside . the courthouse last week, Hartman said she would never try to sneak . onto a plane again. 'It was stupid, and it is something I don't want to . repeat,' she said. Still, . Los Angeles Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said he had a feeling . the woman 'with a fixation on flying would return to LAX, so police . passed out fliers with her picture. 'She was seen wandering through several terminals today in what appeared to be a scouting mission,' he said on Monday. Hartman was arrested for violating terms of her 24-month probation, which was issued after she pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of willfully and unlawfully entering the city as a stowaway on an aircraft. Repeated attempts:  Hartman was sentenced to 18 months probation for attempting to board three Hawaii-bound flights earlier in the year . In . February, Hartman was sentenced to 18 months' probation in San Mateo . County after being arrested for attempting to board three Hawaii-bound . flights at San Francisco International Airport on three separate days. Her . breach of security at the San Jose airport caused federal officials and . the airline to launch investigations. It also prompted criticism of the . airport in light of the trespassing of a teenage boy who stowed away in . the wheel well of a Hawaiian Airlines flight and survived an arduous . journey to Maui. Hartman, who authorities say has a . history of mental illness, has now been arrested eight times for . trespassing at airports this year - though this is the first time she's . been caught after successfully boarding a flight. She . said last week that homelessness drove her to take 'desperate . measures,' and that she feels safer being in airports than in the . streets. San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said that Hartman has no family and has never married. According . to a her blog, found by the San Francisco Chronicle, she has lived in . sketchy motels and squalid apartments from Seattle to San Diego in the . last few years. Records . indicate Hartman was arrested November 6, 2010, at the Lihue Airport in . Kauai after trespassing into the baggage claim area, the Chronicle . reported. She was charged with simple trespass, but failed to show up . for court hearings - and remains the subject of a bench warrant. Plane fixation: Hartman tried at least three times to breach airport security before she was able to get through a checkpoint without a boarding pass at Mineta San Jose International Airport on Monday, August 4 . According . to the newspaper, Hartman said in her blog that she had successfully . hopped a plane once before. She was found out and detained - but later . released without charge. In May - after being arrested seven times at San Francisco International Airport - Hartman was placed in a mental treatment program but she stopped attending last month. 'She declined all of our efforts to offer her assistance,' Wagstaffe said. 'And we tried all of the alternatives we had because we weren't interested in locking her up on our end.' Then she went back to the San Francisco airport, but Wagstaffe's office declined to file charges after her seventh arrest in July for another failed attempt. On Monday, Hartman was only caught after the plane landed at Los Angeles International Airport and the crew counted the passengers who remained on board for the final destination to Phoenix. She was hauled off the plane and charged with trespassing by the Los Angeles Police Department.","Marilyn Jean Hartman, 62, was found wandering through airport terminals after a judge ordered her to stay away from the facility.

50585,"McCann took interim charge of the team with five games remaining and guided them to two wins a draw.
Dundee are now safe from relegation but McCann is holding off talks on taking the job permanently.
""I need to do my job properly, and that is setting the team up to win games,"" McCann said.
""Afterwards, once the guys go away for a well-earned break, I will sit down with the club.""
Dundee travel to Hamilton on Saturday, with their hosts needing a win to ensure that Inverness Caledonian Thistle finish the season in bottom place.
McCann's side lost 2-0 at Inverness on Wednesday night, in his first defeat as manager. The 42-year-old says he has ""absolutely loved"" his time in charge, and will hold talks with Dundee managing director John Nelms and Sky Sports - who employ McCann as a pundit - before deciding his future.
""I had a brief conversation, 20-second stuff, regarding the conversations that will take place after the Hamilton game,"" McCann said.
""I will of course sit down with Sky because Sky have allowed me to come out of a job which I am contracted to do, to come into this one. So I need to oblige that favour and give the honour back to them. I have still got a job to do with Sky at the [Scottish] cup final.
""I have absolutely loved the job and I wouldn't disrespect the club or Sky by giving any indication of what way I'm going to go. I need conversations.""
Dundee were second-bottom when they sacked Paul Hartley after a seven-game losing streak, but McCann managed to turn the team's form around.
There was frustration, though, as Inverness raced to a 2-0 lead in the opening 10 minutes at Caledonian Stadium on Wednesday night.
""I didn't enjoy the start of the game, I didn't enjoy last night going over in my mind what I could have done differently, what we could have done differently as a group,"" McCann said.
""There were certain things as a manager I learned and certain things as a coach I learned, and I have kicked myself. Maybe I should have done certain things to help the guys. So I will take stock of that. It was a difficult night but I am back in ready to go again.""",Dundee United manager Paul McCann says he will hold talks with the club after Saturday's Scottish Cup final against Hamilton.
12007,"The attack on a Danish political cartoonist ""runs totally against the teachings and values of Islam,"" the umbrella organization representing Muslim countries has said. If the attack was a reaction to Kurt Westergaard's drawing of the Muslim prophet Mohammed with a turban shaped as a bomb, ""then it should be rejected and condemned by all Muslims,"" the Organization of the Islamic Conference said in a statement Sunday. An ax-wielding Somali man is accused of trying to break into Westergaard's home Friday and was charged the next day with attempted assassination. Intelligence officials linked the suspect to an East African Islamist militia allied with al Qaeda. The suspect tried to kill Westergaard and an on-duty police officer, the Danish Intelligence and Security Service said. Danish police shot the 28-year-old suspect Friday night as he tried to enter Westergaard's home in the city of Aarhus. The suspect was shot in the right leg and left hand. He was hospitalized after the incident. Video showed him appearing at court strapped to a stretcher. Authorities did not identify him because the judge decided it would be illegal to disclose his name, said Chief Superintendent Ole Madsen with the East Jutland Police. They said he has legal residency in Denmark and lives in Sjaelland, near Copenhagen. The judge ordered the suspect held for four weeks while the investigation proceeds. Madsen said the man is currently the only suspect in the case, and he would not say whether police were investigating anyone else. Al-Shabaab, the militant organization with alleged ties to the suspect, is waging a bloody battle against Somalia's transitional government and is currently on a U.S. government list of terrorist organizations. At a news conference in the Somali capital of Mogadishu, al-Shabaab spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage said, ""We are very happy with the Somali national who attacked the house of the Danish cartoonist who previously insulted our prophet Mohammed. This is an honor for the Somali people. We are telling that we are glad that anyone who insults Islam should be attacked wherever they are."" Police had no indication that an attack was being planned on Westergaard, Madsen said, though the intelligence service said the suspect had been under surveillance because of his alleged terrorist links. Police said the suspect wielded an ax and a knife and managed to crack the glass front door of Westergaard's home. A home alarm alerted police to the scene, and they were attacked by the suspect, authorities said. Westergaard, who was home with his 5-year-old granddaughter at the time of the break-in, hid in a ""panic room"" when he realized what was happening, Madsen said. Westergaard is ordinarily accompanied by bodyguards when he leaves his home, but nobody was on guard at the house Friday, the Security and Intelligence Service told CNN. Police said Westergaard was ""being taken care of"" after the break-in, but wouldn't reveal his new location. The incident ""once again confirms the terrorist threat that is directed against Denmark and against cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, in particular,"" said Jakob Scharf, spokesman for the Danish Security and Intelligence Service.

79158,"It has been a rocky couple of years for the people of Egypt. Since the 2011 revolution, the economy has tanked, street protests are an almost daily occurrence and the political situation remains volatile. However, a handful of young Egyptians have found that the best way to take a stand against the turmoil is with stand-up comedy. ""We are like a little beam of sunlight, coming through and reminding people, 'Don't worry! When this cloud passes, it will be brighter. It will be happier,'"" says Rami Borai, a comedian in one of Egypt's first home-grown comedy troupes, Hezb El Comedy. The group, whose name means ""The Comedy Party,"" was formed in 2009 by Hashim Al Gahry, who admits he started up with ""zero capital."" Al Gahry and some friends pooled their savings, and started marketing the group through social media. When they're not performing, Hezb El Comedy teaches the art of stand-up to other aspiring comics, instructing them on things like timing and body language. ""We're not the funniest people in the world, but it's the experience that has put us in a position to give them advice and tell them, 'These are our mistakes, and this is what you can do to avoid what we did,'"" says Al Gahry.

In Qatar, a few young comics have come together to form SUCQ (an acronym for Stand Up Comedy Qatar). ""It's an American art. We took it from the Americans. We have reshaped it to adapt to our culture and society and people,"" says Hamad Al Amri, 24, a comedian who is also a banker by day. Mohamed Kamal, who also performs stand-up with SUCQ, notes that given Qatar's political climate, there are limits to what he can joke about. ""We can't talk about politics, or very sensitive topics, like sex or religion,"" he notes. For those comics in the Middle East who don't censor themselves, comedy can be a risky business. Earlier this month, Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef made headlines after he was charged for mocking both Islam and Egypt's president, Mohamed Morsy. Other comics in the region have faced similar fates. Sami Fehri, a Tunisian producer of a political puppet show, was imprisoned for corruption charges, and Saudi blogger Raif Badawi was jailed last year for mocking religious figures.

""If I ever read a newspaper that said, 'Ramy was indicted,' I would say, 'Yo, mom, this is it!'

They warn that it will likely lead to higher fares for airport journeys as only official airport taxis will be exempt from the charge, and there are fears the fee could increase in the future.

It was set to become a reality when the 26-year-old went into labour last Thursday at a Perth hospital with her fiancée Wayde Kelly by her side. But minutes away from giving birth to Kyden Thomas Bede Kelly, things took a tragic turn. Ms Shepherd passed away  after suffering an amniotic fluid embolism - a rare complication that occurs 6.1 times in every 100,000 deliveries. Scroll down for video . Wayde Kelly and Kymberlie Shepherd were expecting their first child when the 26-year-old went in labour in Perth last Thursday. But minutes away from giving birth, things took a tragic turn . The 26-year-old dance teacher passed away after suffering a rare complication as she was giving birth to their son, Kyden Thomas Bede Kelly . 'Everything was going well. Kymmy had been given the gas to help relieve the pain, but she still did her make up again so she was looking how she wanted for the photos after the birth,' Mr Kelly told Daily Mail Australia. 'She was pushing hard and they said the baby was close. I looked up to change her iPod as she told me she was light-headed. 'As they got the oxygen on her, she just lost consciousness, let go of my hand and had a fit. 'It's something I will never forget.' Mr Kelly said he experienced 'mixed emotions' meeting his son Kyden for the very first time . He was told Kyden was born at 10.36am but couldn't bring himself to see him for an hour because he was worried about his partner . Mr Kelly said the couple had never heard of an amniotic fluid embolism and never predicted something like this could happen. 'I was told Kyden was born at 10.36am, but Kym was in a serious condition. I couldn't even go and see him for an hour as I just wanted to know about Kym,' he said. 'They worked on her for two hours before they stopped and just said she was fighting and while she was they would too. 'We were told at about 12.15pm that she had passed away and I just sat in tears and shock at the table.'

Mr Kelly said he experienced 'mixed emotions' meeting his son for the first time. 'It was Kymmy's dream to hold him. I didn't think I could enjoy it without her. But I wanted to see if I could find a positive in anything and I did,' he said. The couple, who got engaged last December after four years together, had spoken often about having a baby and decided now was the perfect time after she was made a permanent dance teacher at Safety Bay Senior High School. 'She would have made the best mum. Having a baby was the one thing she had always wanted to do,' he said. 'We were so excited. Kymmy had the baby's room and absolutely everything sorted. 'She was just the most selfless, kind, caring and giving person.' Mr Kelly said it was Kym's dream to hold their son and she would have made the best mother . He was unsure if would enjoy being a father without Kym, but said he wanted to find a positive out of losing her . Mr Kelly proposed to Ms Shepherd last December at Mount Warning in Queensland after four years together. The couple, who had lived together in London for two years and travelled extensively, recently moved to Perth to start their life together. 'My favourite thing about her was her bubbly personality and infectious smile,' Mr Kelly said. 'Everyone she met knew who she was and I have never heard a bad word said about her.' He said he was glad there were so many people out there who would be able to tell their son what type of person his mother was. 'I will tell him she had such an amazing impact on everyone she came in contact with,' he said. 'She had such a love of life and I'll tell him that she would want him to do what he loved.'

The couple, who had lived together in London for two years and travelled extensively to 25 countries, recently moved to Perth to start their life together . Following Ms Shepherd's tragic death, Mr Kelly now wants to raise awareness about amniotic fluid embolism. 'It is the number one cause for maternal death in developed nations, but no one I know or had spoken to had any real knowledge about it,' he said. 'I didn't even know if could happen before the birth. 'I just hope that somewhere down the track, someone, somewhere can come up with an epipen-like solution that could be available in all birthing suites.' Mr Kelly plans to move back to the Gold Coast where both their families are to raise Kyden.","Kymberlie Shepherd was expecting her first child when she went into labour.

Communities Minister Lesley Griffiths defended the spending as ""transparent"".
The 3Gs Development Trust in Merthyr Tydfil spent nearly £1.3m of its £1.5m budget between 2012-13 and 2014-15 on salaries and £250,000 on ""other project costs"", according to a response to a Freedom of Information request by the Welsh Conservatives.
Mr Davies told BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme that staff costs were ""disproportionate"".
""It does seem... that a huge amount of the money is going into offices and salaries rather than actually getting into the projects themselves,"" he said.
""There needs to be a greater look at these figures now, whether that be the Auditor General looking at it or whether that be the Welsh government themselves.""
A spokesperson for Merthyr Tydfil council defended the trust, which serves Gurnos, Galon Uchaf and Penydarren, saying salary costs included those for staff on the ground such as youth workers, not just administrators.
Over £300m has been spent on Communities First by the Welsh government since it was launched in 2001, including around £30m in 2015-16.
Communities Minister Lesley Griffiths told Sunday Politics Wales that spending on Communities First was ""transparent"" and she was ""comfortable"" with the way money was spent.
""It's our flagship tackling poverty programme, has been for many years, it's a very people-intensive programme,"" she said.
""We've got our Communities First staff working face-to-face, one-to-one with many of the most vulnerable in our communities in some of our most deprived areas.
""There is robust monitoring of the programme - we monitor the outputs, we monitor the outcomes, there's financial audits done.
""You cannot see staff costs [as] independent to the project - it's absolutely integral.""

91843,"By . Ben Spencer . Exposing newborn babies to germs could help prevent asthma as they grow up, research suggests.The findings bolster the theory that modern obsession with hygiene and cleanliness has driven a boom in allergies and health problems. According to the 'hygiene hypothesis', exposure to bacteria is necessary to prime the immune system early in life. Many scientists believe that modern society, with its mania for sanitation and easy access to antibiotics, makes children hypersensitive to harmless allergens. Researchers believe that exposing children to germs as babies could help them avoid asthma in later life . The latest work, published last night in the journal Nature Medicine, may lead to bacterial treatments in which germs are intentionally fed to infants. The scientists found that when newborn mice were exposed to allergens they were better able to ward off asthma. Other studies have already shown that airway exposure to bacteria can be effective at controlling allergy-driven airway inflammation in adult mice, the scientists said. The team, led by Dr Benjamin Marsland, from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, wrote: 'Our current study indicates that such treatments could be greatly optimised by targeting the narrow developmental window that exists following birth, or by targeting specific molecules. 'A key future step will be to translate these findings to human infants.' More than five million people in the UK are undergoing treatment for asthma, including 1.1 million children. Around 1,250 Britons die from asthma every year and mortality rate is the third highest in Europe, behind only Estonia and Spain. The latest figures, released last week, show that the numbers have been steadily rising since 2009 when there were 1,140 deaths. Asthma attacks are caused by an over-strong inflammatory immune response to allergy triggers such as house dust mites, pets or air pollutants. The study showed that newborn mice were vulnerable to inflammation in the lungs when exposed to allergens. But when their lungs were colonised by microbes, they developed immune cells that are anti-inflammatory and can suppress asthma. The regulatory T cells kept the immune system in check and suppressed the inflammation.Keeping mice in sterile conditions to prevent this colonisation rendered them sensitive to bugs and resulted in asthma as adults. Interaction with a protein called PD-L1 was vital to the development of these cells, the researchers found. When PD-L1 was blocked, it had the same effect as keeping out the microbes - an exaggerated response to allergy triggers that persisted into adulthood. Figures show that 1.1 million children in the UK suffer from asthma (picture posed by a model) The scientists wrote: 'Overall, the concept of early developmental windows of allergic lung disease based on microbial colonisation represents a change in mainstream pathophysiological paradigms and presents unique opportunities for future post-natal modification of disease risk.' Evidence is growing to support the hygiene hypothesis. In 2011, in a study of 1,400 children, researchers at Yale University in the U.S. found that babies who received antibiotics had a 70 per cent higher risk of suffering from asthma in childhood. The scientists thought the asthma risk may have been caused by the fact that the antibiotics have wiped out swathes of bacteria - good and bad - in the babies' bodies. They suggested the drugs had deprived the young immune systems of a healthy benchmark of normality on which to base their development. In the years before antibiotics and scrupulous hygiene, our immune systems were used to bacteria and learnt to ignore this as non-hazardous. But in a overly sanitary environment, the immune system can over-react to minor provocations, such as harmlessly low levels of bacteria. American professor Rob Dunn, author of The Wild Life of Our Bodies, believes we should convince our bodies they are still in the natural state of our ancestors. Professor Dunn, of North Carolina State University, said: 'We have gone from lives immersed in nature to lives in which nature has disappeared. 'But our bodies continue to expect to meet our old companions, the parasite species with which they tangled for generation upon generation.' The latest research comes after a major report last week concluded that Britain is failing to cope with the country's asthma problem. Up to 800 patients are dying needlessly from asthma every year because doctors are prescribing the wrong medication or failing to properly monitor them, according to the Royal College of Physicians. The report found that prescription errors had occurred in half of deaths while many other patients had not been offered check-ups or key advice on how to manage the condition and avoid attacks.",'Hygiene hypothesis' says exposure to bacteria is necessary to prime immune system. Scientists found that when newborn mice were exposed to allergens they were better able to ward off asthma.

35188,"Flt Lt Sean Cunningham was killed at RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire, after being accidentally ejected from his Hawk T1.
The inquest has heard that he was ejected because of a problem with the ejection seat firing handle.
The coroner also criticised the RAF and the seat manufacturer following the three-week inquest.
The 35-year-old pilot, who was born in South Africa and grew up in Coventry, died on 8 November 2011.
The inquest has heard that the ejection seat firing handle had been left in an unsafe position which meant it could accidentally activate the seat.
It is thought that one of Flt Lt Cunningham's seat straps had pulled it into this unsafe position on his previous sortie, on 4 November.
Testing of the Mk.10 Martin-Baker seat showed that the safety pin could be inserted even when the seat was in this unsafe position, giving the impression the seat was safe.
Recording a narrative verdict, Coroner Stuart Fisher said the safety pin mechanism was ""entirely useless"" and said the pin's presence was ""likely to mislead"".
During the inquest the court heard parts of the Mk.10 Martin-Baker ejection seat were redesigned following the death of Flt Lt Sean Cunningham.
The coroner was told a small metal plate has been designed to fit over the ejection seat firing handle (pictured), to prevent the seat from being activated accidentally.
A new type of bolt, which cannot be over tightened, has also been designed for the parachute drogue shackle at the top of the seat.
The new parts have not been brought into use yet, but in the meantime, customers have been warned about the problems with the seat firing handle and existing bolt.
How dangerous is life as a Red Arrow?
Seven RAF personnel, including Flt Lt Cunningham, had 19 opportunities to check the ejection seat firing handle and did not notice it was in the unsafe position.
Mr Fisher said the RAF had failed to take ""sufficient steps"" to bring the risk to the attention of air and ground crew, and said this had contributed to the pilot's death.
Flt Lt Cunningham's parachute should have saved his life, but the main chute failed to deploy because a nut and bolt had been fastened too tightly, the inquest heard.
Mr Fisher said none of the engineers who worked on the parachute mechanism can be criticised.
Martin-Baker knew the parachute mechanism could jam if the nut and bolt were too tight as early as January 1990, the inquest was told.
The manufacturer warned some air forces but did not warn the MoD.
Mr Fisher said: ""There was a very serious failure of communication by Martin-Baker in my view.
""It is unexplained by the evidence. It seems there is no logic to warn and inform some but not others.""
Lincolnshire Police conducted a criminal investigation into the death, and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) considered manslaughter charges against the Ministry of Defence, Martin-Baker and three unnamed individuals.
The CPS concluded that no manslaughter charges should be brought, due to ""insufficient evidence"".
However, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) could still prosecute Martin-Baker and/or the MoD, and will consider whether to do so now the inquest has concluded.
Flt Lt Cunningham's parents agreed an undisclosed settlement with the MoD in December, after the MoD admitted liability for the incident.
Martin-Baker issued a statement extending ""sincere condolences"" to Flt Lt Cunningham's family and friends.
""On this occasion, uniquely in the entire history of Martin-Baker ejection seats using this particular feature, it [the parachute] failed due to a shackle bolt being too tight.
""In light of this incident, lessons have been learned and we have taken steps to alert all our customers worldwide who still use this type of seat, of the risk of over tightening the shackle.""
Flt Lt Cunningham took Night Nurse medication the night before the accident, but Mr Fisher was satisfied this did not impair his abilities.
Speaking after the inquest, his father Jim Cunningham said: ""We welcome the conclusion of the coroner which confirmed what we knew all along, which is that Sean was blameless and his tragic death was preventable,
""We therefore welcome the coroner's recommendations which we hope and pray will ensure no family such as ours has to endure such a pointless and avoidable death.""
Air Commodore Terry Jones, speaking on behalf of the MoD, said: ""There have been a number of lessons for us and others to absorb and correct and we have made and will continue to make every effort to ensure that such a tragic accident cannot occur again.
""The Red Arrows in particular will be a stronger, safer and better team as a result.""","The death of a Red Arrow pilot was ""preventable"", an inquest has heard."

63310,"The result had begun to seem beyond doubt as judge Theodor Meron analysed the failings of his colleagues in The Hague tribunal's trial chamber - but there was still drama and tension.
Finally, in the equivalent of stoppage time, he confirmed what one news agency called ""a rare victory for Serbs"" at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
Momcilo Perisic, the man who led Yugoslavia's army in the mid-1990s, would be acquitted on all charges and released.
His convictions - for aiding and abetting crimes against humanity in Sarajevo and Srebrenica - and his 27-year prison sentence were overturned.
The former general responded with nothing more than a twitch of his left eye. But his compatriots may feel entitled to be somewhat less restrained.
Recent verdicts at the ICTY have left many Serbs with the impression that the tribunal delivers nothing more than victor's justice - jailing Serb defendants while allowing crimes against Serbs to go unpunished.
Just three months ago the same appeal chamber, chaired by the same judge, sparked outrage in Serbia when it quashed the conviction of two Croatian generals, Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markac.
They had previously been found guilty of deliberately targeting civilians during the offensive known as Operation Storm in 1995.
Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Serbs fled Croatia en masse. Many are still without permanent homes or jobs and have been unable to recover the property they left behind.
The appeal chamber's verdict left them without justice as no-one else has been convicted of crimes against Croatia's Serb minority.
The retrial of Kosovo's former Prime Minister, Ramush Haradinaj, brought another acquittal last November.
With a prosecution case riddled with holes, the verdict came as no surprise. But it left Kosovo Serbs in a similar position to their Croatian counterparts.
Just two weeks later, the ICTY found a Bosnian Serb commander, Zdravko Tolimir, guilty of genocide for his part in the Srebrenica massacre of 1995.
This was justice for the thousands of victims, but coming so soon after the other two verdicts it reinforced the feeling among many Serbs that the tribunal was weighted against them.
But the Perisic verdict may help to restore faith in the neutrality of the special court. Serbian human rights activist Natasa Kandic told the BBC that it was an important judgement for all Serbs.
""They will see the ICTY is not just trying to prove that Serbs are criminals. They will say the ICTY has proved that Serbia does not have state responsibility for the atrocities in Sarajevo and Srebrenica,"" she said.
But Ms Kandic still has concerns about the way in which the verdict was presented.
""The judgement didn't mention the victims. We need additional instruments to gain justice for the victims. This judgement doesn't mention them - 8,000 dead people - where is the justice for them?""
Campaigners like Ms Kandic see this as the real failing of the ICTY. For all its aims of providing international-standard justice to the people of the former Yugoslavia, it has provided precious little in the way of reconciliation.
From a Serbian point of view, the Perisic verdict adds credibility to the tribunal's other decisions, which have put many ethnic Serbs in jail. But long-term reconciliation in the region may require more than just a judicial process.","The verdict of Serbia's appeal court has been acquitted of genocide for his part in the 1995 massacre of 8,000 civilians in Sarajevo and Srebrenica."

The funds are to come out of the £8.4bn the government has promised to the health service during this Parliament and comes on top of extra money already announced for children's services.

Mental health care is sometimes called the Cinderella service of the NHS. Over the years it has been neglected, marginalised and under-funded. The taskforce's report acknowledges this.
So will the recommendations have the necessary impact? Ministers and NHS bosses have all said they're fully committed to it.
But similar things were said in 2011 when the coalition launched its mental health strategy. And, as the BBC reported on Sunday, that didn't stop investment being cut.
With money so tight in the NHS, the nagging fear is that despite the promises being made history could still repeat itself.

Currently £9.2bn a year is spent on the condition - less than a tenth of the NHS budget - despite one in four people experiencing a mental health problem each year.
The result is that an estimated three-quarters of people go without any help, with the taskforce's report acknowledging that services were so bad that lives have been ""put on hold or ruined"" and ""thousands of tragic and unnecessary deaths"" have been caused.
The review also said more attention needs to be paid to rising suicide rates.
NHS England believes the strategy will help to ensure that another one million people receive support - whereas at the moment fewer than two million people do so.
It said the investment promised will help pay for:
It said that together these measures would help reduce the demand on specialist inpatient wards in hospitals and therefore help tackle the much-criticised practice of sending people long distances for treatment.
Paul Farmer, the chief executive of the mental health charity Mind, who led the taskforce, said the strategy should act as a ""landmark moment"" for mental health care, which was currently ""very patchy"".
""We are saying to the NHS, to government, to industry, to local leaders and to the public that mental health must be a priority for everyone,"" he said.
While the extra funding was crucial, he added that some stigma around mental illness ""still prevails, right the way inside the health service, as it does in society"", and this needed to change.
NHS England boss Simon Stevens said he was ""fully committed"" to implementing the recommendations.
But Royal College of Psychiatrists president Prof Sir Simon Wessely warned it would take ""sustained work"" to end the ""decades of inequality"".
And Prof Sheila Hollins, of the British Medical Association, pointed out such promises had been made before.
""Those suffering from mental illness need to see these pledges fulfilled.""
Meanwhile the Welsh government said spending on mental health had been ring-fenced since 2008, with investment topping £600m this year.
The current annual allocation to mental health in Northern Ireland is £247m.
The Scottish government said it had made a commitment to invest an additional £150 million over a five year period in improving access to mental health services.

67747,"Explosive scenes: Dame Helen Mirren plays the Queen in the Broadway production of The Audience . It is one of the most extraordinary confrontations in recent British political history. The Queen pleads with Tony Blair to call off the planned 2003 invasion of Iraq in a fraught private audience at Buckingham Palace, imploring him to seek a diplomatic solution from the United Nations. But with British forces poised to join the US in bombing and ground assaults the next day, he says: ‘The right thing to do is to go in now, and go in hard.’ This explosive scene is in a new Broadway production of controversial play The Audience, with Dame Helen Mirren as the Queen. Publicity material for the play says it will ‘break the contract of silence’ around private audiences between the Queen and her Prime Ministers. It describes the meetings as both ‘intimate’ and ‘explosive’. It’s the first time Blair has been in the play, written by Peter Morgan and directed by Stephen Daldry. It ran in London depicting meetings with seven Prime Ministers including Churchill and David Cameron. Royal experts denounced a scene suggesting the Queen had a negative view of the invasion. She asks Blair: ‘You don’t want to give it more time?’ A defiant Prime Minister says it will lead to the overthrow of a tyrant and the creation of democracy, saying: ‘We confidently predict liberated Iraqis will cheer our soldiers through the streets after a short, sharp and easy campaign.’ Blair refers to bombing taking place ‘tomorrow’, placing the alleged meeting on March 19, 2003, the day before the Allies launched their ‘shock and awe’ campaign. But the court circular, which lists the Queen’s official engagements, makes no reference to the meeting. The discrepancy will increase pressure on Morgan to justify claims in the play, which premiered in London in 2013 and is to return to the capital this year. The playwright, now working on a £100 million blockbuster about the Royal Family called The Crown, has never revealed his sources, saying much of it was based on ‘anecdotal information’. He said: ‘If transcripts exist, I’m confident she’d emerge with credit.’ But historian and constitutional expert Andrew Roberts last night said: ‘The idea the Queen would oppose the war because she is the Left-wing conscience of the nation is rubbish. It is easy for playwrights to impose Left-wing views on the Queen, secure they will not be denounced.’ Private chats: The Queen with Mr Blair  in 2002 - the year before the Allies launched their campaign in Iraq . The scene is controversial because Britain’s case for war, including Blair’s close relationship with President George W Bush, the ‘dodgy dossier’ of evidence of Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction and the legal advice of former Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, are all under scrutiny in the long-delayed Chilcot Inquiry. Roberts said last night: ‘There is no sense the Queen would be with people opposing the Iraq War on the streets. BLAIR: We confidently predict that liberate Iraqis will cheer our soldiers through the streets after a short, sharp and easy campaign . QUEEN: [pleading] You don’t want to give it more time? Just get back to the United Nations and see that a diplomatic solution can be reached . BLAIR: [insistent] No ma’am, the right thing to do is go in now, and go in hard . 'She would have intelligence reports people demonstrating on the streets wouldn’t have. She is close to the Armed Services. Her family understands military dangers.’ Constitutional expert Professor Vernon Bogdanor, who advised on the original production, said the Queen prized the confidential meetings and would probably distance herself from anyone who betrayed a confidence. But he called the play’s depictions of the audiences as highly plausible, as was the idea the Queen could ask a question about Iraq. He said: ‘I think her manner is to ask questions rather than to argue. ‘She might have asked, do you not think it a good idea to go to the UN? He might have said no. But I think Mr Blair would have been more deferential.’ Royal biographer Penny Junor said: ‘I suspect the Queen would voice concerns. That’s what she’s there for.’ It is not clear if the scene will be in the London revival this year, with Kristin Scott Thomas in the title role. Buckingham Palace declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Tony Blair. Morgan and Daldry were unavailable for comment.",Explosive scene in Broadway production of play The Audience.

Yesterday the shaven-haired thug who broke the 20-year-old’s jaw and left him at the mercy of the muggers was facing jail after being convicted of grievous bodily harm and robbery. Isagba told the court he was ‘very, very ashamed’ of himself. But Judge Witold Pawlack told Wood Green Crown Court: ‘He is facing a long prison sentence and there is no reason that I can see why he should remain on bail now.’ Mr Rossli was cycling over a flyover in Barking, East London, with a friend on August 8, during the height of the looting and violence which swept the country. The accountancy student, from Kuala . Lumpur, managed to dodge past one group of hoodies who lunged at him. But he then felt a hand reach into his jacket pocket. As Mr Rossli turned round to look, he was hit in the face. The blow, which was not featured in the clip, smashed his jaw and threw him from his bicycle to the laughter of a gang of youths watching.

The woman, who lives near Oxford, appeared before Judge Simon Oliver at a hearing in Reading.
He said she could still be jailed in the New Year if she breached orders.
The authority had asked for her to be committed to prison but Judge Oliver adjourned the application with the approval of council lawyers.
The judge told the woman she must not identify herself or her daughter when speaking about the case, as evidence showed publicity would distress the teenager.
But while the woman said she was happy not to identify her teenage daughter in English, she thought it unfair to restrict her when speaking in her own language.
A representative of the Polish Embassy in London was present at the hearing.
Former Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming, who campaigns for improvements in the family justice system, has raised concerns about the case.

22715,"By . Sean Poulter . Tattoo and piercing services have joined the group of Britain’s fastest growing high street shops as Britons aim to emulate celebrities like David Beckham and Cheryl Cole. There was a net increase of 89 in the number of tattoo specialists in the UK in 2013, which represents a rise of almost 12 per cent. Despite being lambasted as ‘tramp stamps’, an increasing number of people from all walks of life are turning to body art, delivering an air of respectability. Cheryl Cole has tattoos all over her body including on her back, thigh, neck and bottom . The example is being set by everyone from Olympic sporting heroes like Victoria Pendleton to the Prime Minister’s wife, Samantha Cameron, who has a dolphin on her ankle, and the respected BBC journalist David Dimbleby, who opted for a scorpion on his shoulder. The numbers have been published as part of a new high street survey which reveals independent entrepreneurs are opening shops at a faster rate than the big chains are putting up the shutters. Figures published today show that while the big chains closed outlets at the rate of 16 a day in 2013, independent stores opened at a much faster pace of 44 a day. The biggest increase was seen in mobile phone shops as the smartphone becomes a modern day essential with the total up by 157 in 2013 or some 23.93per cent. The second biggest rise was for barbers with a rise of 136 outlets, while there was also a net increase of 107 in the number of beauty salons. Fourth on the expansion list were tattoo and piercing parlours with a net increase of 89, ahead of charity shops, with a rise of 88, and nail salons at 87 . The biggest fall was in shops specialising in women’s clothes as chains scale back the number of high street outlets with people increasingly buying fashions and shoes online. Sports personalities also favour the body artwork. Victoria Pendleton has a tattoo on her arm and David Beckham has tattoos on his arms and chest . The research, conducted by the Local Data Company, found a net fall of 140 in specialist women’s clothes shops, while there was also a fall of 49 in general fashion shops and 48 in shoe shops. The move to shopping online was also reflected in a drop of 43 in the number of furniture shops. The figures also found a reduction of 75 in the number of newsagents in 2013 as they struggled to counter competition from the hundreds of convenience stores selling magazines and newspapers opened by the big supermarkets. There was also a fall of 62 in the number of jewellers. The cost of living squeeze has seen a rise in the success of budget supermarkets, however the research found a net fall of 56 in pound shops and general discount shops. Pubs continued to struggle in 2013 with a net fall of 44 as people suffering a cost of living squeeze cut back on nights out, while there were also 47 fewer bars. Samantha Cameron has a dolphin tattoo on her ankle . Michael Weedon, the deputy chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, said: ‘Independent tailors, bakers, barbers, grocers, hairdressers, confectioners, coffee bars are on the rise as towns see them replace fashion and shoe shops, jewellers, newsagents and booksellers. ‘As chains cut their links one by one with high streets our towns are showing signs of reverting to older models of economic activity, where they serve the needs of physical customers in physical stores, alter their clothes, style their hair and mend their broken iPhones. ‘The churn is huge, with more than 15,000 independents closing in 2013 - but nearly 16,000 opening their doors for the first time. It is not a fluke. It is consistent. ‘Give an entrepreneur a sniff of an opportunity and a chance of a profit and they will create businesses and fill empty units.’ Matthew Hopkinson, director at the Local Data Company, said: ‘Against all odds Independent retail and leisure businesses have continued to grow in our town centres. ‘The propensity of independents to survive and thrive varies massively by place, as does the churn rate. ‘Clearly the appetite is there and increasingly independents are adjusting to the new challenges of the total retail world  - online and offline - as well as the competition they face from their big ‘chain’ brothers. 'Independents are an important part of every town and are the one thing that drives diversity in what has become a homogenous world.’ David Beckham visited this tattoo parlour in Middleton, Manchester for a consultation in 2003 .","There was a net increase of 89 in the number of tattoo specialists in the UK in 2013.

Chelsea have signed Diego Costa,Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis at a combined cost of £75m this summer.
In addition to Drogba's arrival after he left Turkish side Galatasaray, defender Kurt Zouma and goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois have returned to Chelsea after loan spells.

90960,"A group of campaigners who want Britain to stay in the EU single market argued that Parliament must approve the UK's exit from the European Economic Area.
But the judges refused to give the green light for the challenge, saying the judicial review was ""premature"".
The Supreme Court ruled last month that Parliament must have its say before the government can trigger Article 50 and begin official talks on leaving the EU.
Parliament is in the process of considering legislation which would give Theresa May the authority to notify the EU of the UK's intention to leave by the end of March.
MPs overwhelmingly backed the bill on second reading on Wednesday.
The latest legal challenge was brought by supporters of a so-called ""soft Brexit"" - which would see the UK remain a member of the EU's internal market.
They include Peter Wilding, chairman of the pro-Europe pressure group British Influence, and lobbyist Adrian Yalland.
The government claimed the case was unarguable since the existing EEA agreement would automatically cease to exist once the UK left the EU.
Under the terms of the EEA, which first came into legal force in 1994, the EU's 28 members and three other signatories are bound to accept the free movement of people, services, goods and capital across their borders.
Dismissing the case, Lord Justice Lloyd Jones and Mr Justice Lewis said the government had not made a decision ""as to the mechanism by which the EEA agreement would cease to apply within the UK"".
As a result, they said it was not clear at this stage what issues, if any, would fall within the jurisdiction of the courts.
In a joint statement, Mr Wilding and Mr Yalland suggested the government had ""used procedure"" to thwart them.
They said they would not rule out bringing further proceedings to give all those who would be directly affected by Brexit some form of legal certainty about their rights.
""It is intolerable that those who depend upon their EEA rights to trade with the EEA, or those who are married to EEA citizens, or are EEA citizens resident in the UK, are being used as a negotiating pawn by a government who can choose to act unilaterally to clarify our legal position, but will not,"" they said.
""The government must stop playing poker with our rights and stop taking liberties with our freedoms.""
But a government spokesman welcomed Friday's decision.
""As the prime minister has said, we will not be a member of the single market and we will be seeking a broad new partnership with the EU including a bold and ambitious free trade agreement,"" he said.
Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the ruling was ""good news"".",The UK government has refused to allow a legal challenge to Article 50 of the European Union to be heard by the Supreme Court.
94842,"The first VR headsets were released earlier this year, and have already been selling in their thousands.
The PS VR even outsold every other console on the market, during its first week of release in Japan.
Tech expert Mark Zuckerberg, who created the social media site Facebook and owns a VR company, thinks that Virtual Reality is: ""going to change the way we live and work and communicate in the future.""
So, we asked four tech fans to put some of the best VR headsets through their paces, and find out what they think...
The Playstation VR is the most recent VR headset to hit the market, being released on the 13th October 2016.
Although it is the cheapest of the four VR headsets we reviewed, you still have to have a Playstation 4 console and a Playstation camera to play it, which can more than double the overall price!
However, like the Oculus, it is not ""fully immersive"" - you can only sit or stand and look around whilst using it, you cannot walk around.
One of the major points about the PS VR, which separates it from the other headsets, is that there are already lots of games available for it, with more on the way.
It's one of the more technically advanced headsets available and is completely immersive - meaning you can walk around freely - well, as far as the cable will let you!
Its sensors help to warn you of objects around you, and stop you from bumping into things.
However, you do need a very powerful computer to be able to run it - and its costs a lot more than the PS VR and the Oculus Rift.
Also, there aren't as many games as some of the other consoles.
The Oculus was the first VR Headset to hit the market, and as a result, has lots of games available for it.
However, the Oculus was released without a specific controller - and when the controller does come out in December, it will be around Â£190. Currently you can use an XBox controller, and need a powerful computer to run it.
Like the PS VR, you can't move around whilst playing on the Oculus just yet, however they are looking into changing that by the end of the year.
The Oculus has built-in headphones, which makers say makes it feel more ""immersive"" - like you are in the game.
This high-tech headset is only available to developers at the moment, who can try it out and help the makers to improve it.
It combines virtual reality with augmented reality - meaning you can see digital things in the real world - similar to mobile apps like PokÃ©mon Go.
It doesn't come with a controller, as you control it by moving your hands around and using key words to tell it what to do.
It also doesn't have any cables, like all of the other headsets - meaning you have completely free movement.
People have said it can be a bit difficult to adjust to your head, and it is quite heavy at the front, meaning it can slip down your nose.
You can also only see the virtual shapes directly in front of you, meaning there is a bit of a gap around the edges of where you can see.
Microsoft haven't given a specific date as to when the HoloLens will be available to buy in a shop, but they have hinted that it might be a few years away yet.
Virtual reality is still pretty new, and scientists aren't sure how it will affect people's health in the long-term, especially eyesight.
So most VR makers have guidelines which recommend that only people over the age of 13 play them.
Some people have also reported feeling a bit seasick whilst playing on them.

15920,"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:44 PM on 14th November 2011 . The Norwegian right-wing extremist who confessed to a bombing and shooting massacre that killed 77 people tried to give a speech describing him as a resistance leader at his first public court hearing today - but was cut off by the judge. Wearing a dark suit, Anders Behring Breivik was escorted by guards into an Oslo court room packed with dozens of reporters and members of the public. They included survivors and families of his victims who were able to see him face-to-face for the first time since the bloody rampage. Extremist: Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik is taken into an Oslo court in a police van today for the first open hearing of his case . Guises of a killer: Anders Behring Breivik in military uniform (left) which he had requested to wear at a previous court hearing and (right) in an image found in a manifesto attributed to the anti-Islam extremist earlier this year . Breivik began portraying himself as . the 'commander' of a Norwegian resistance movement and rejected the . court's authority to hear his case before the judge interrupted him and . told him to stick to the issue at hand. Speaking at a court just two blocks . from where he detonated a huge homemade bomb, he said: 'I am a military . commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and Knights Templar . Norway. 'Regarding the competence (of the court), I object to it because . you received your mandate from organisations that support hate ideology . (and) because it supports multiculturalism.' He acknowledged carrying out the . massacre, but refused to plead guilty to terror charges. He claims he is . in a state of war to protect Europe from being taken over by Muslim . immigrants. 'I acknowledge the acts but I do not plead guilty,' Breivik told the court. Breivik, speaking at a court picketed . by a group of protesters holding a banner that read 'No speakers' platform for fascists', attempted to address survivors and victims' relatives, but the court denied his request. Facing a killer: Survivors of Breivik's rampage wait nervously in the courthouse to see him for the first time since the attacks in July . Highly charged: Armed police stand guard at the courthouse in anticipation of the hearing as media, survivors and protestors mingle outside . Media storm: Journalists wait in line for a final security check in the Oslo courthouse before today's hearing . Speaking after the hearing, Bjoern . Ihle, 20, from Oslo, said: 'He aimed at me on Utoeya Island. That was . the last time I saw him. 'It is good to see he was powerless, . which he was not then. He looked nervous and weakened. It was a . different experience than when I saw him at Utoeya.' Most of the island victims were in . their teens or 20s and some were shot at point-blank range or while . trying to swim to safety. Daniel Vister, another survivor, said Breivik looked weak and his rant showed he was mentally ill. 'I think that what he said there shows that he is completely mad. He is definitely not on this planet. 'I didn't think he would look like that ... he was very big then and he now looked so flimsy,' he said. In a rambling manifesto posted on the . Internet before the attacks, Breivik wrote that his arrest would open . 'the propaganda phase' of his operation to ignite a war to defend Europe . against a supposed Muslim takeover. The world watches: Members of the press wait in room 828 of the courthouse before Breivik is led in for the hearing, but only after the photographers have left . The hearing, required under Norwegian . law to keep a suspect in prison before trial, was Breivik's fourth, and . as expected, the court decided to keep him in custody for a further 12 . weeks. He will likely remain in prison until he goes to trial, probably in the first half of next year. About 120 people were admitted to the . courtroom, while hundreds of others squeezed into overflow rooms . equipped with video links. Breivik has been kept in solitary . confinement since July 22 and has been denied visits, correspondence and . access to newspapers and television. The prosecution asked the court to ease those restrictions slightly on Monday, but the judge declined. At the end of today's hearing, however, the judge lifted a ban on reporting on the proceedings. Investigators say Breivik set off a . fertilizer bomb outside the government headquarters on July 22, killing . eight people, before heading to an island retreat, where youth sections . of Norway’s governing Labour Party were gathered for their annual summer . camp. Devastation: Smoke billows from a 17-storey government building after Breivik's bomb rocked central Oslo on July 22 killing eight people . Disturbing: Police and rescue groups recover some of the last remaining bodies from Utoeya Island after Breivik, posing as a police officer, shot dead 69 during a rampage at a youth camp . Disguised as a police officer, he opened fire on scores of panicked youth, shooting some of them as they fled into the lake. Sixty-nine people were killed on Utoeya island before Breivik surrendered to a police SWAT team. The carnage left Norway shocked and continues to haunt a nation that sees itself as peaceful and tolerant. An online manifesto attributed to . Breivik sheds light on his choice of targets. In it, he lays out a . blueprint for a multi-phase revolution, targeting left-leaning political . elites he accuses of destroying their own societies by admitting large . numbers of immigrants, especially from Muslim countries. His actions were widely condemned, including by the anti-Islamic bloggers and groups that he cited prolifically in the document. Oil-producing Norway, home to the .

17048,"He was loved for his delicate prints and colourful textiles but there was more to artist William Morris than a charming way with wallpaper. Indeed, as a groundbreaking new exhibition on the Pre-Raphaelite painter reveals, Morris was not only a socialist firebrand who almost single handedly sparked the arts and crafts movement, he also had decidedly risqué tastes in gardening implements. Included in Anarchy & Beauty: William Morris and his Legacy is a set of gardening tools created by sculptor Eric Gill which are guaranteed to raise an eyebrow or two. Risqué: Sculptor Eric Gill is behind this rather naughty garden roller which shows Adam and Eve . Based on the story of Adam and Eve, the roller created for Morris by Gill shows the biblical couple in a rather compromising position. Gill, now disgraced after being revealed to be both incestuous and overly fond of the family dog, was a friend of Morris' and shared his left-wing politics. But eye-opening though Gill's designs are, it is Morris who proved to be the most radical as the diaries and copy of Marx's Das Kapital included in the collection make plain. None of this comes as a surprise to curator and cultural historian Fiona MacCarthy, who says Morris believed that 'beauty was a basic human birthright' and as such, art should be available to everyone - including him. So, and in spite of his membership of the Socialist League, Morris wasn't immune to the odd vanity project, including encasing his copy of Das Kapital in gold. On display: Gill's roller takes pride of place in the National Portrait Gallery's new William Morris exhibition . Portrait of a painter: Morris pictured towards the end of his life in 1887 (left) and right, as a young man . 'Only William Morris would encase Karl Marx in a gold-tooled binding,' adds MacCarthy. 'It was part of his religion of nothing but the best – not for the elitist connoisseur but nothing but the best for the whole populace.' Despite his lofty ideals, much of Morris' work ended up on the walls of the Victorian elite, although his 'art for everyone' philosophy made him enormously popular. And that wasn't the only way in which he showed off his left-wing credentials. Like many other intellectuals of the time, Morris was fond of the mandal, an example of which is included in the exhibition. Dating from 1880, the sandals became popular in the UK following a visit to India by Morris' friend, philosopher Edward Carpenter. 'Carpenter was the man who introduced the sandal to left-wing circles,’ reveals MacCarthy. ‘They became a kind of cult among left-leaning middle-class intellectuals.' Family: Morris (top left) with his glamorous wife Janey (bottom right) and Sir Edward Burne-Jones (centre) Striking: Morris' beautiful wife Jane - or Janey as she was also known - regularly appeared in artworks . Pretty: William Morris is famous for his pretty garden-inspired wallpaper and textile designs . But the National Portrait Gallery exhibition, which opens this week, isn't only about Morris, his mandals and his risqué taste in gardening tools. Among the 140 artefacts to star in the exhibition is a beautiful portrait of Morris' wife Jane as well as a striking peacock brooch made as part of the arts and crafts craze sparked by Morris and his friends. Other highlights include striking pieces by Bernard Leach and Terence Conran, as well as furniture and jewellery that belonged to Morris himself. ‘In the 21st century, our art and design culture is widespread,' adds MacCarthy. 'But its global sophistication brings new anxieties. 'We find ourselves returning to many of Morris’s preoccupations with craft skills and the environment, with local sourcing, with vernacular traditions, with art as a vital force within society, binding together people of varying backgrounds and nationalities. 'This exhibition, as I see it, will not only explore what William Morris’s vision was but will suggest ways in which his radical thinking still affects the way we live our lives’.",Anarchy & Beauty: William Morris and his Legacy opens at the National Portrait Gallery. Among 140 artefacts on display is a beautiful portrait of Morris' wife Jane. Also on display is a set of gardening tools created by sculptor Eric Gill. Gill is now disgraced after being revealed to be both incestuous and overly fond of the family dog.

42846,"By . Wills Robinson . Sinead Dewar, 25, was jailed after a vicious attack which left Jessica Moran, 34, with multiple head injuries after attacking her with a stiletto heel . A strip club dancer who stamped on a colleague’s face with her 6in stiletto heel after arguing over a glass of wine has been jailed. Sinead Dewar, 25, left 34-year-old Jessica Moran in 'continual pain' from her injuries after punching her five times in the face at Room 32 in Preston, Lancashire. She then repeatedly kicked and stamped on the victim's head as she tried to crawl away. Preston Crown Court heard that Ms Moran suffered a fractured cheekbone and eye socket following the attack in the dancers’ changing area of the club. Dewar launched the 'sustained attack' after Ms Moran, who was working her first shift at the venue, confronted her about a glass of wine she claimed was taken before she finished drinking it. The court heard that the argument broke out in the customer area of the bar on June 28 last year. The head dancer stepped in and said they should sort things out away from the customers. Downstairs in the changing area, Dewar launched the vicious attack with a 6in pair of cream stiletto heels. Ms Moran, who has been forced to leave her job since the attack, now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as nightmares and anxiety attacks. Jailing Dewar, Judge Niclas Parry said: 'You used persistent and repeated violence using a very dangerous form of footwear. 'She asked if you had taken her glass of wine and an argument flared up. You punched her in the nose and, having been shaken by that, you punched her again, causing her nose to bleed. Dewar, pictured arriving at Preston Crown Court, punched Ms Moran in the face five times before repeatedly kicking her and stamping on her head . The 'sustained' attack took place at Room 32 in Preston, Lancashire, after a row erupted over a glass of wine . 'You threw four or five punches and you gripped her by the neck as you punched her in the face. 'You proceeded to kick and stamp on her several times. With the heel, you stamped on her head many, many times. 'She . tried to crawl away and you stamped on the back of her legs. You used . your foot and for the most part a very large stiletto heel.' He added: 'Her left eye was completely closed up from the abrasions. It took four days before she could open it. 'She . cried through the night and she was terrified that in the morning her . infant son would wake to see the state you had left her in. Dewar cried in the dock at Preston Crown Court as she was jailed for 16 months . 'Her son saw her the the following day and saw her face which was injured by you. 'Once a bubbly person, she now suffers flashbacks and anxiety attacks. She suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and struggles sleeping.' Sarah Johnston, prosecuting, told the court that the attack on Ms Moran, who now has a constant shadow in her left eye, has also impacted upon Ms Moran’s family and her social life. Dewar, who suffers from Asperger syndrome, denied the offence but was convicted by a jury of causing actual bodily harm in March this year.

It was the first sheep-shearing world record attempt in the northern hemisphere.
At one point Mr Smith, originally from New Zealand, was tackling the sheep at a rate of one every 36 seconds - well ahead of the 45 second target.

91625,"Twenty-four of 25 officers balloted said Mr Gargan should not be allowed to return to his post.
A panel found him guilty of eight counts of misconduct last month, but Mr Gargan, 48, was cleared to resume his duties after being suspended.
On Wednesday he was told to quit by the force's police and crime commissioner.
PCC Sue Mountstevens said Mr Gargan had ""abused his position"" by forwarding emails and ""storing intimate images"" on his work phone and revealed she had started the process of using new powers to call on him to quit.
The ballot results were disclosed in a letter written to Ms Mountstevens, the contents of which she revealed on Thursday.
Turbulent times for police chief
Of the 25 officers balloted, who are all of at least superintendent rank, 24 said they had no confidence in Mr Gargan, while one abstained.
Speaking on behalf of Mr Gargan, Mark Polin, the chair of the Chief Police Officers' Staff Association, said the PCC was using the wrong piece of legislation to remove the chief constable.
He said: ""Section 38 of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act lays out the process for suspending or removing a chief constable.  Home Office guidance states that a separate disciplinary procedure under the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2012 must be used instead of Section 38 where there is an allegation of misconduct.
""In CC Gargan's case, this misconduct procedure has taken place and the panel has recommended that CC Gargan should return to work.
""It seems evident from the statement issued by the police and crime commissioner that she intends to rely on essentially the same facts considered by the misconduct panel to seek to remove Chief Constable Gargan under Section 38, which we believe was intended to be used in different circumstances.""
Last month, the independent panel cleared him of gross misconduct. It recommended a final written warning be issued for each of the eight misconduct counts - the severest possible sanction.
The letter to Ms Mountstevens, from the Police Superintendents' Association branch chair Ian Wylie, was sent on 14 August.
It urged her to take on board the officers' views when reaching her decision ""in relation to the future leadership and direction of this organisation"".
The letter said the officers were given the opportunity to change their votes after the full details of Mr Gargan's misconduct became known and that none of them did.
It added: ""It is our opinion that his position is no longer tenable to maintain public or internal confidence.""
The letter followed a call from three former chief constables of the force for Mr Gargan to resign.
He was appointed by Ms Mountstevens in January 2013 after his predecessor, Colin Port, quit when she asked him to reapply for his job.
Following Ms Mountstevens' call for Mr Gargan to quit, the Chief Police Officers Staff Association, on his behalf, said he had ""complied with every requirement of the protracted misconduct investigation and subsequent hearing"" and had apologised for misconduct.
""He placed his fate in the hands of an expert professional panel, which made a clear recommendation that he should go back to work,"" the statement said.
Mr Gargan remains on full pay but is suspended from duty.",Police chief Constable Mark Gargan has been told to quit after he was found guilty of gross misconduct by an independent panel.
30609,"By . Laura Cox . It's becoming a rather annoying ritual for BBC viewers. You settle down to watch a much-anticipated TV drama – then have to crank up the volume or switch on the subtitles. Just a month after the BBC’s Jamaica Inn was lambasted for its mumbling actors and poor sound quality, the corporation’s latest big release, Quirke, has been hit by the same complaints. Drama: Crime series Quirke, starring Gabriel Byrne, has attracted complaints about its audio quality . Anger: TV star Richard Madeley was one of the viewers to vent his fury about the dialogue . Viewers watching the crime drama on Sunday night were furious when they couldn’t make out what was being said. They reported having to switch on subtitles or turn up the volume to the maximum setting, while others simply gave up and turned it off. Set in 1950s Dublin and based on the novels by Booker Prize-winning author John Banville, Quirke follows the city’s chief pathologist, played by Gabriel Byrne, as he investigates a murder. Pugh's take on the silent drama Quirke . But it seems many of the 4.2million who watched the first episode in the three-part series struggled to follow the action, with TV presenter Richard Madeley leading the complaints on Twitter. Madeley blamed the BBC’s sound editing, writing: ‘Was really looking forward to Quirke, BBC1, 9pm – but despite winding volume up to 100 per cent, still can’t hear at least a third of dialogue! Again! ‘And it’s definitely the programme – switched channels and sound boomed out massively loudly. Back to Quirke, and inaudible. Grrrrrr!!!!’ He persevered with the programme a little longer, then finally announced: ‘Oh well, I give up. Throws ear-trumpet away and hobbles upstairs to bed, prematurely aged by c*** c*** c*** BBCTV sound.’ Another viewer also blamed the quality of the sound editing, tweeting: ‘I spend 99 per cent of my time with subtitles! I’m 35 ... BBC buy new [microphones].’ But others blamed the actors for failing to enunciate properly, likening the effect to the mumbling cast of Jamaica Inn. One viewer wrote: ‘Trying to enjoy BBC’s Quirke but too much mumbling and not enough enunciation! Jamaica Inn revisited?’ Before changing channels, another tweeted: ‘We turned over, can’t be bothered with whispers.’ They weren’t alone in turning off the programme in frustration.

Firefighters believe the battery of a 2008 MacBook Pro started the blaze after the battery fell out onto the floor of the ground-floor flat on Southwest 49th Street. Laptop fire: A mattress and clothing caught fire in the blaze in Corvallis, Oregon, on Wednesday morning. Firefighters said it was caused by a Macbook Pro battery that fell out onto the bedding igniting the blaze . The incident has prompted the local fire chief to warn against leaving laptops near combustible surfaces when not in use and get batteries which overheat or don't hold a charge checked out immediately. Thankfully a fire alarm was in place in the house shared by students at Oregon State University. When it went off they discovered the smoldering clothes and mattress and immediately called 911, because of their quick reaction damage to the property was said to be 'minimal'. Warning: Firefighters in Corvallis, Oregon, have warned residents to store laptops, like the 2008 Macbook Pro, pictured left, away from combustible surfaces following the Wednesday morning blaze at the shared home . Corvallis Fire Prevention Officer Jim Patton told the newspaper: 'Fire damage was minimal and limited to the small area of origin near the nightstand and bed.' The owner of the laptop had left the computer so it was partially hanging over a wooden nightstand, according to the report. It is believed the battery fell from there to the floor. The American Red Cross said they would be help residents find temporary accommodation while the damage was assessed.

The new system compares photographs with images already contained on the police's database (file picture) The new technology is not admissible in courts but it provides officers with a possible lead, allowing them to track down other evidence. Leicestershire's Chief Inspector Chris Cockerill revealed that the system managed to identify potential suspects in 44 per cent of cases analysed by the system. He said: 'There's the potential for this to look like Big Brother... but that's not the case. This is not a surveillance tool, it's an information and surveillance tool for searching for suspects.' The new system may be able to identify thousands of other suspected criminals after it was announced that police in London will be routinely issued with body-worn cameras following the shooting of Mark Duggan which led to mass rioting and looting in Tottenham. The man was arrested after the computer flagged the family resemblance with criminals already photographed . Already, police have been equipped with cars fitted with an automatic number plate recognition system. The cameras photograph a car's number plate and run it through police databases, alerting officers if a car is not taxed or insured. Other details such as whether a car is used by a suspected criminal can be included on the system. However, Emma Carr of Big Brother Watch told The Independent: 'This takes the intrusiveness of CCTV to the next level, so it is absolutely essential that people are able to access meaningful redress when they feel their privacy is infringed.

Lancashire have won two of their opening three Championship matches - the same amount of the rest of the top flight put together.
This success was largely built on dismissing Hampshire for 109 on the first day, but their push was halted by the loss of two sessions to the weather on day three.
On an overcast but uninterrupted final day, the home side were forced to work hard for the eight wickets they required in conditions that offered little to the pace bowlers and on a batting surface that remained true.
Resuming on 76-2, 271 behind, Hampshire lost England hopeful James Vince for the addition of eight to his overnight 39, driving to short cover to give James Anderson a third wicket.
It could have been argued that Hampshire's best chance of saving the game went with their captain, but the obdurate Smith ate up 213 deliveries before being trapped in front by Kyle Jarvis.
Wheater, strong off the back foot, once again batted well, only to be pinned leg before by a quicker one from Kerrigan.
From there Kerrigan, giving the ball more air to find increasing amounts of turn, worked through the lower order with the help of leg-spinner Liam Livingstone, who had Tino Best lbw for his maiden first-class wicket.
Kerrigan completed his 12th five-wicket haul and the match when Mason Crane top-edged a sweep to leg slip.
Hampshire captain James Vince told BBC Radio Solent:
""The morning of day one we put ourselves on the back foot and it was always going to be difficult to claw ourselves back into that game.
""We showed some glimpses of good cricket, but again we haven't strung it together. To get off to a start like that, it was always going to be incredibly tough to turn it round.
""A disappointing result and a disappointing first day especially. But, there are still signs there that we are playing some good cricket and some guys are in good form.""",Lancashire's Championship hopes were shattered as they lost to Hampshire on the final day of the match.

From cleaning up banana smeared floors to non-stop running around, bringing up a young family can feel like an endurance test at times. And although this musical offering from Australian father of three Matthew Hodge won't make chores and stress go away, it might just put a smile on your face. Set to Carl Orff's famous Carmina Burana, the Ode to Sleep Deprived Parents and Terrorising Toddlers, includes such lyrics as: 'Put my phone down/Where are your pants?', 'Why won't you sleep?/Is it your teeth?' - all of which will be instantly recognisable to the harassed parents of those entering the terrible twos. Harmonious: Sydney's Philarmonic Choir sings Hogde's revamped version of the Carmina Burana . Familiar? Hodge's lyrics will strike a chord with anyone who has or has had a toddler in their life . O' you terror!Get down from there!Mummy's getting cranky... Put my phone down.Where are your pants?What have you done with my purse?Don't throw those blocks.What is that smell?Why do you look so happy?What's in your mouth?Who ripped that book?Why won't you just stop moving? He's on the chair!Just standing there!Wobbling like a drunk man.Where is my mug?What was that crash?Who let you in the kitchen?You've got a knife!Put it down now!Don't wave it near your sister! Put my phone down.Where are my apps?Who dialled triple zero? Why won't you sleep?Is it your teeth?I need another coffee!My head's so sore!Look at the floor!Cleaning will take forever. What's wrong with you?What did I do?Why do you do this to me?I hope when you... Have some kids too...They drive you crazy! The new version of Carmina Burana, which has been used on scores of film soundtracks including Lord of the Rings, is the result of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra's 'Say it with Carmina' contest, which invited members of the Australian public to come up with new lyrics. Despite competition that included odes to the Pope and one entrant's new pet cat, Hodge’s libretto received the most votes. According to Hodge, who lives in Sydney, the ditty was inspired by his youngest son, who at just a year old, has started walking, climbing and generally causing mayhem in the Hodge household. When he penned the winning lyrics, Hodge’s wife Rachel had just endured a 'night of limited sleep and a day of rampant destruction' with the toddler. '(She) recognised many of the phrases instantly and given that our son threw her phone into the toilet two days later, they seemed very appropriate,' Hodge told TODAY Moms - a parenting blog linked to NBC's Today show. 'I put the lyrics together one lunchtime when I heard about the contest. The original lyrics refer to a relentless wheel of fate crushing the poet, and Carl Orff's music reflects that, with its short, sharp phrases and its repeating melodies. 'Somehow, the idea popped into my head that we speak to our children in ‘short, sharp phrases’ as well when we're telling them off.' The winning entry was sung by the 200 members of the Sydney Philharmonia Choir and the resulting video posted on YouTube, where since last month, it has received more than 150,000 views. 'Parenting, while it's highly rewarding, is also a job that involves many frustrations and we constantly find ourselves barking orders to these little people that just won't listen,' added Hodge, who also revealed that he hopes to show the video to his son when he's older - ideally on his 21st birthday. 'So I think many parents have found themselves saying very similar things to their children.'",The Ode to Sleep Deprived Parents and Terrorising Toddlers is sung by Sydney's Philharmonia Choir.

95537,"It has always been a role with the potential for controversy.
Sir Peter de la Mare, the Speaker or ""Prolocutor"" of the Good Parliament in April 1376 opened the first day with a long address on the shortcomings of the Crown - military failures, financial and moral corruption. Royal favourites were imprisoned. King Edward III's mistress, Alice Perrers, was condemned to ""seclusion"".
But by the autumn, royalty had fought back. The Parliament was dissolved and most of its work was undone. The King's mistress was back at Court.
The King's son, John of Gaunt, had Sir Peter de la Mare thrown in jail.
And the new Speaker was John of Gaunt's own steward, the far more biddable Sir Thomas Huntingford.
Until the 17th Century, the Speaker's loyalty was to the Crown rather than to MPs.  But they were often blamed if they delivered news the monarch didn't like.
It could be a dangerous job: seven Speakers were beheaded between 1394 and 1535.  That's why even today a new Speaker traditionally makes a show of being dragged reluctantly to the Chair.
Staying on the right side of the Crown was especially tricky during the turmoil of the Wars of the Roses, when it was hard to be sure who would end up being the King.  One Speaker, John Wenlock, tried to hedge his bets by fighting on the side of both the Yorkists and the Lancastrians.
It didn't work out well. He was killed at the Battle of Tewkesbury, allegedly by his own commander who blamed Wenlock's general indecisiveness for the defeat.
Gradually, the Speaker's role became one of representing Parliament, rather than the monarch.
When Charles I came in person to the Commons on 4 January 1642 to arrest five MPs for treason, Speaker William Lenthall refused to reveal where they were. Hitherto seen as a rather timorous chap, this was his moment.
He fell to his knees, but told the King: ""May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.""
The King was humiliated and left without the men he'd come for.
John Bercow is being criticised by some MPs today for - in their view - failing to be impartial on political issues. But the Speaker's impartiality is a relatively modern notion. In fact, some Speakers held other government offices at the same time.
They could take part in some debates and vote, when they weren't actually presiding over business.
Arthur Onslow, who had the job for more than 30 years, began to change that. In fact, he used to boast of his impartiality - to the great irritation and disappointment of the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole, who'd helped him to the job.
It wasn't until the Victorian era that our current ideas of impartiality became the norm - though Irish Nationalists in the 1880s felt that Speaker Henry Brand stepped over the line in helping to put down their disruption in the Commons over Irish Home rule. In January 1881, they prolonged debate for 41 hours.
There were disorderly scenes. Irish MPs defied the Chair. And so, Speaker Brand helped the government to invent new procedures, still in use today, to cut the debate short on the Coercion Bill for Ireland.
In spite of the controversies, it's almost unprecedented to sack a Speaker.
Although in recent times, Michael Martin, was pressured into resigning, the only other one to be ousted forcibly was Sir John Trevor in 1695, who'd been found guilty of accepting a Â£1,000 bribe.
He also had the disadvantage of being so cross-eyed that MPs couldn't tell if he was giving them the nod to speak, or looking at someone else.
And of course, for any MP who tries to oust a Speaker but fails, there's a big risk that in future debates, the Speaker seems strangely unable to see them at all, when they're hoping to be called.",The House of Commons has been renamed the Speaker of the House of Commons for the first time in the history of the country.
18513,"In Wales, councils are responsible for funding and overseeing schools.
But in England, Mr Osborne's plan will mean local authorities will cease to have a role in providing education.
Academies are directly funded by central government and head teachers have more freedom over admissions and to change the way the school works.
It is a significant development in the continued divergence of schools systems on either side of Offa's Dyke.
And although the Welsh Government will get extra cash to match the money for English schools to extend the school day, it can spend it on any devolved policy area.
Ministers have no plans to follow suit.
At the moment, governing bodies are responsible for setting school hours and they need ministerial permission to make significant changes.
There are already more than 2,000 secondary academies in England and its extension to all state schools is unlikely to shake the Welsh Government's attachment to what they call a ""community, comprehensive model"" for schools.
It rejects claims that freedom given to academies can help drive up standards, and it points to academy-free Scotland as the best performing school system in the UK.
Education Minister Huw Lewis said there was ""very little evidence to suggest"" academies have a positive impact in driving up standards and Wales would not be following the model.
""The Tories have wasted hundreds of millions of pounds on academies and free schools and as the Chancellor finalises his budget plans to slash vital services even further, he is committing them to wasting even more on a failing endeavour.
""We have no plans to introduce the chaos and waste of academies and free schools here in Wales.""
None of the main parties in May's Assembly election - including the Welsh Conservatives - have said they want to introduce academies in Wales.
Owen Hathway, NUT Cymru's policy officer, called the academy plans for England ""scandalous."".
""There is no evidence that academies work, no evidence that they raise standards, no evidence that they offer better quality education and no evidence that they are what parents and communities want,"" he said.
""Certainly a commitment to comprehensive education is something we would want, and indeed expect, all parties to hold firm to in their manifestos for the forthcoming Welsh election.""
But the Welsh and English schools systems are still linked by a joint arrangement for teachers' pay and conditions.
Academies are not tied to these pay scales so in effect Wednesday's announcement will take all English schools out of the system and raise questions about the viability of an England and Wales pay and conditions structure.
There is already growing momentum for the devolution of teachers' pay and conditions.
Originally sceptical, the Welsh Labour Government is now broadly in favour.
Some teaching unions remain opposed because of concern that Welsh teachers would end up being paid less than those in England.
Mr Hathway said teachers were concerned it could lead to regional pay.
""At the same time we do of course recognise that the issue of pay is already becoming a grey area due to the negative changes we see taking place in England,"" he said.
But an even bigger difference between the schools landscape on either side of the border, appears to make separate arrangements for pay increasingly likely in future.",Chancellor George Osborne has announced plans to devolve the role of academies in England's schools.
20266,"George Groves overcame his shattering defeat to Carl Froch by replaying the moment he was knocked out nine times the next morning. Groves, who was floored in the eighth round against Froch in May, is hoping to lay the demons to rest when he fights Frenchman Christopher Rebrasse on September 20. The bout will serve as a final WBC title eliminator but it has added importance for Groves, who is looking for rejuvenation after his loss to Froch in front of 80,000 fans at Wembley Stadium. Groves watched the fight back three times that same night and trainer Paddy Fitzpatrick made his pupil go through it all again the following morning. Carl Froch is ready to return to the ring for the first time since his defeat to Carl Froch . He will take on Frenchman Christopher Rebrasse on September 20 in a WBC title eliminator . Fitzpatrick said: 'I went over the next morning and we watched the fight again and then I took a gamble and rewound it - we watched it nine times and George looked at me as if to say ""all right"". 'I brought up as many emotions as I could so he could deal with them earlier.' Fitzpatrick continued: 'I didn't just watch it nine times with my arms round him - we looked at it and asked why it happened. Carl Froch defeated George Groves in eight rounds at Wembley Stadium in May in front of 80,000 fans . 'I wanted him to feel the emotion early and deal with it, like when you get a brown envelope through the door and you don't open it because you know it's bad news. 'You have to deal with it before you can move on.' Groves spent the following week away in Dubai with his wife Sophie and says it was important to come to terms with the Froch defeat before considering his next move. 'I didn't realise Paddy was testing me but it was fine,' Groves said. 'You can't talk about being a realist and then shy away from it. I didn't get angry, it was just frustrating. I was still pretty numb. 'I took time away and the rest of the week was difficult but by the time I got home I wanted to get back to work.' The animosity between Froch and Groves that drew so much attention in the build-up to both fights has not cooled over the past four months. George Groves throws a left hook at Carl Froch during their super fight in London . Froch unblocked his opponent on Twitter but otherwise there has been no contact between the pair, which leads Groves to believe there could be a third fight in the future. 'Carl doesn't like me and that's fine, he'll have a swipe at me at every moment,' Groves said. 'He's certainly not satisfied after the last fight and I wonder why - if I knocked somebody out I'd be pretty satisfied with it. But he's not, he can't put it to bed. 'For that reason only, I think there might be a third fight because he doesn't like me. 'For whatever reason - perhaps he said more prayers than I did - he came out with two wins in a fight I said he couldn't win. 'I don't need to be Carl Froch's friend and I don't plan to be.' Groves also endures a frosty relationship with James DeGale after he inflicted the first loss of DeGale's professional career in 2011. 'Fighters don't like me and I think it's because if you watch me box, everyone thinks I'm s***,' Groves said. Carl Froch looks over George Groves after a knock down in their grudge match in May . 'And I'm happy to talk back to an opponent or a rival and pull them apart when sometimes boxing etiquette is to smile and nod along. 'I can be humble and I can be a realist and tell the truth - and I usually go out and deliver as well. That's probably what upsets everyone.' The winner of Groves and Rebrasse will become the mandatory challenger to American Anthony Dirrell for the WBC super-middleweight world title. Rebrasse has recorded 22 wins, two defeats and three draws in his career so far but the 32-year-old goes into the fight at Wembley Arena as underdog. 'He's a champion, he has a good track record and he has never been stopped,' Groves said. 'He is coming as a European champion and he has dreams and ambitions and that makes him dangerous. 'I think I am better than him and I need to let him know that but I wont be gung-ho, I won't go in swinging.' Groves added: 'For my own sanity rather than my reputation, I don't want to lose. I'm fully capable of winning and I will win.'",George Groves was knocked out in the eighth round by Carl Froch in May. Groves watched the fight back three times that same night.

81914,"Researchers aimed to see if a trial ten-week yoga course, run by the Prison Phoenix Trust charity, could ease aggression and antisocial behaviour.
Dr Amy Bilderbeck said yoga could ""possibly aid in managing the burden of mental health problems in prisons"".
Inmates from West Midlands' category B and C prisons, a women's prison and a young offender institution took part.
The team from Oxford University's Departments of Experimental Psychology and Psychiatry measured their mood, stress, impulsivity and mental wellbeing compared to other prisoners.
Dr Bilderbeck said: 'We found that the group that did the yoga course showed an improvement in positive mood, a decrease in stress and greater accuracy in a computer test of impulsivity and attention.
""Offering yoga sessions in prisons is cheap, much cheaper than other mental health interventions. If it has any effect on addressing mental health problems in prisons, it could save significant amounts of public money.""
She cautioned that yoga lessons would not ""suddenly turn prisons into calm and serene places, stop all aggression and reduce reoffending rates"".

59313,"By . Hugo Gye . UPDATED: . 09:18 EST, 9 September 2011 . MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland may be barred from voting on laws which only affect England, as the Government moves to tackle the thorny 'West Lothian question' for the first time. An independent commission will be set up to consider the issue, which was first raised 34 years ago by Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP for West Lothian. The question has become more pertinent since the advent of devolution in 1997, when separate administrations were set up for Scotland and Wales. Parliament: MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could be barred from voting on England-only legislation . Since then a large number of policy issues, particularly relating to public services, have been devolved to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly. English MPs sitting at Westminster have no say over the policies set outside of English borders. However, English policies on issues like education and healthcare are still decided by the UK Parliament, and are voted on by MPs who make up the chamber meaning they can come from all the countries of the Union. In 1977, Tam Dalyell, pictured above, the Labour MP for West Lothian, pointed out that Scottish devolution could mean Scottish MPs voting on English affairs, with English MPs unable to vote on Scottish affairs. In response, controversial right-wing MP Enoch Powell said: 'Let us call it the West Lothian question.' The introduction of Scots and Welsh devolution in 1997 meant that responsibility for many policy areas was taken out of the hands of Westminster, but that MPs from those countries could still vote on purely English issues. Solutions which have been suggested for the problem include the establishment of a purely English parliament, and banning Scottish MPs from votes which do not affect their constituents. However, every possible answer has its drawbacks, and none has been very widely accepted despite it being an issue which has rumbled on for 34 years. Since devolution, there have been growing calls for 'English votes for English laws', so that MPs should no longer be able to vote on laws which will not apply in their consistuencies. The controversial voting issue became particularly heated in 2004, when Labour's policy on top-up fees was passed only with the support of Scottish MPs, even though the controversial policy did not apply in Scotland. Now after 34 years the current Government is determined to take action to end the anomaly. Constitutional reform minister Mark Harper announced in a statement to MPs that a formal proposal for the commission's work, and its terms of references, will be announced soon after Parliament returns from the party conference season. It will be made up of a small group of non-partisan experts with constitutional, legal and parliamentary expertise. Their primary task will be to examine how the Westminster Parliament can 'deal most effectively with business that affects England wholly or primarily, when at the same time similar matters in some or all of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are lawfully and democratically the responsibility of the separate parliament or assemblies,' Mr Harper said. Ministers will consult with Commons Speaker John Bercow and other parliamentary authorities before the launch of the commission, he added. All political parties will be given 'a full opportunity to have their say' following the completion of the commission's work. The commission will not consider the funding of different parts of the UK, nor the balance between English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs in the House of Commons. Plaid Cymru MP Elfyn Llwyd said: 'England deserves to have its own administration to deal with issues which affect England only. 'This would then ensure that there is a clear distinction between what is a matter for England and what is a matter for other countries too. The lines are too blurred as they are.'",English MPs have no say over policies set outside of English borders.

35582,"Undercover FBI agents in Florida found what investigators believe is a stolen Henri Matisse painting that had been missing for nearly a decade, officials said Wednesday. Two suspects were arrested in Miami Beach after trying to sell ""Odalisque in Red Pants,"" valued at $3 million, federal prosecutors said. The painting was stolen from a Venezuelan art museum in 2002, the statement said. Pedro Antonio Marcuello Guzman, 46, of Miami and Maria Martha Elisa Ornelas Lazo, 50, of Mexico City are charged with transporting and possessing the stolen painting, the FBI said. If convicted, they face up to 10 years in prison. Undercover agents made the arrest Tuesday at Loews Miami Beach Hotel, CNN affiliate WPLG reported. Marcuello set up the deal, told agents he knew the painting was stolen and asked them to pay $740,000 for it, the FBI and federal prosecutors said Wednesday, citing an affidavit filed in support of a criminal complaint. Ornelas was a Mexican national who worked as a vacation rental agent in Acapulco, according to WPLG. She arrived at the Miami International Airport on a flight from Mexico City on Monday, carrying a red tube containing the painting, prosecutors said. The next day, Ornelas and Marcuello met with undercover agents and were arrested. Sarah Murov, a spokeswoman for the hotel, declined to comment, referring questions to the FBI. The Venezuelan government had ""initiated the steps for the prompt return"" of the painting and asked the FBI to confirm reports of its recovery, the country's Institute of Cultural Patrimony said. ""Odalisque in Red Pants"" was reported stolen from the Caracas Museum of Contemporary Art in 2003, when officials revealed that another painting that had been hanging in its place was a fake. The museum purchased the painting from a New York art gallery in 1981. Marcuello and Ornelas made their first appearance in a Florida federal court Wednesday. Their pretrial detention hearing is scheduled for Friday. Stolen Salvador Dali painting returned .","Two suspects tried to sell ""Odalisque in Red Pants,"" valued at $3 million.

12846,"Amid heightened tensions with North Korea, the United States and South Korea on Sunday began joint military exercises. The military exercises, dubbed Invincible Spirit, are scheduled to run through Wednesday in waters off South Korea to demonstrate the alliance's resolve. In addition to the 8,000 personnel involved, military officials say, the exercises will include 20 ships and submarines and about 200 aircraft. The U.S. Defense Department said the drills are in response to the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan and are intended to send a strong message to Pyongyang to stop ""provocative and warlike acts."" The drills will include anti-sub infiltration exercises, said Cmdr. Jeff Davis of the U.S. 7th Fleet. ""The anti-sub-infiltration exercise works like this: if a sub is coming in to attack a ship, the military finds it and prosecutes it,"" he said. Davis said there was a ""renewed desire"" and urgency to focus on the exercise after the Cheonan sinking. North Korea criticized the exercises, which began at 6:30 a.m. (5:30 p.m. ET). ""The U.S. provocations amount to trespassing on the off-limits fixed by the DPRK and it, therefore, feels no need to remain bounded to the off-limits drawn by the U.S.,"" the state-run Korean Central News Agency quoted a North Korean foreign ministry spokesman as saying. It continued, ""It is the mode of the DPRK's counteraction to react to sword brandishing in kind. The DPRK is prepared for both dialogue and war. It will remain unfazed by military threat and sanctions."" North Korea on Saturday heightened its threats against the military exercises after talks over the sinking of the Cheonan. North Korea ""will legitimately counter with [its] powerful nuclear deterrence the largest-ever nuclear war exercises to be staged by the U.S. and the South Korean puppet forces,"" KCNA reported. Two U.S. military officials told CNN there was no sign of significant troop movement in North Korea. Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, answered ""no"" when asked if there was a real threat of a North Korean military attack over the U.S.-South Korean exercises. ""I think North Korea is just too interested in their own survival to do anything that could end that regime,"" Levin said in an interview broadcast Sunday on C-SPAN's ""Newsmakers"" program. Meanwhile, Friday, in the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas, officers from the North sat down for talks about the Cheonan incident with their counterparts in the U.S.-led United Nations Command. During the almost two-hour meeting in the international truce town of Panmunjom, the U.N. Command reminded the North Koreans of the Security Council's condemnation this month of the Cheonan attack. The Security Council did not mention North Korea by name but condemned the attack strongly, called for ""full adherence"" to the armistice agreement that halted fighting in the Korean War in 1953 and encouraged ""the settlement of outstanding issues on the Korean peninsula by peaceful means."" An international inquiry found North Korea culpable for the March attack that killed 46 South Korean sailors. But North Korea denies a role in the incident, which elevated tension between the two enemies. North Korea demanded again Friday that it be allowed to conduct its own investigation of the Cheonan's sinking and said the upcoming war games are being conducted under false pretext. ""The U.S. forces side would be seriously mistaken if it calculates it can browbeat [North Korea] through large-scale war exercises,"" KCNA said. ""It should immediately stop the [anti-North Korean] nuclear war racket."" At an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting last week, nation after nation expressed deep regrets and offered condolences to the South Koreans. The United States has accused North Korea of aggressive behavior and imposed new sanctions Wednesday. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reiterated U.S. support for South Korea on Friday. ""Here in Asia, an isolated and belligerent North Korea has embarked on a campaign of provocative, dangerous behavior,"" she said in Hanoi, Vietnam. Later, after a repatriation ceremony for the remains of three soldiers who died in the Vietnam War, Clinton said the door remains open for dialogue if North Korea commits to abandoning its nuclear weapons program. ""We would love for them to have the same opportunities that the people of South Korea have been able to enjoy for the last 60 years,"" Clinton said. ""So, it is distressing when North Korea continues its threats and causes so much anxiety among its neighbors and the larger region.""

829,"Phillip Shortman, 27, from Abersychan, Pontypool, had previously admitted 10 counts of fraud at Newport Crown Court.
He was caught after failing to deliver a car part to a police officer who ordered it from him online.
Sentencing him, Judge John Jenkins QC said he was a ""inveterate fraudster who simply will not stop"".
Shortman must also pay £2,065 compensation to his 10 victims and £100 costs.
The court heard he had 17 previous convictions for 77 offences, many related to the online market place.
The judge said eight of his most recent offences - committed on eBay and a car parts website between May and December 2013 - were done while on bail and on licence.
He added: ""Terms of imprisonment have not deterred you, you have continued to act with deceit and manipulation.""
On Wednesday, Shortman admitted using his five-year-old son's details to sell a bogus Samsung Galaxy S4 mobile phone.
He arranged for £480 to be transferred into his wife's account, but failed to deliver the phone.
He then attempted the same con again, being paid £440 for the same phone.
The court was told he then ""attached"" himself to a website selling Suzuki Jeep parts, calling himself Yuppy Bear.

82534,"The Manhattan clinic where Joan Rivers suffered cardiac arrest disputed a report that it happened during a biopsy of her vocal cords. A spokesman for the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic gave CNN its first public statement since Rivers fell ill during a procedure. While federal privacy laws limit what medical providers can make public, the statement counters a New York newspaper report quoting an unidentified source saying a doctor made a ""spur-of-the-moment"" decision ""to take a scalpel to a polyp-like growth on her vocal cord."" ""A biopsy of the vocal cords has never been performed at Yorkville Endoscopy,"" the clinic's statement said. Rivers, 81, died last Thursday in New York's Mount Sinai Hospital, where she was rushed a week earlier after she stopped breathing and her heart stopped beating during treatment at Yorkville Endoscopy. Many questions have been raised about what that treatment was given and what might have gone wrong that led to the comedian's death.  Few answers have been made public because of medical privacy rules, but the New York State Health Department confirmed the agency is investigating. The clinic statement also seemed to address speculation that her cardiac arrest could have been related to the anesthesia used to sedate Rivers while an endoscope, which is a long, flexible camera, was used to examine her throat. ""General anesthesia has never been administered at Yorkville Endoscopy,"" the statement said. ""The type of sedation used at Yorkville Endoscopy is monitored anesthesia care.  Our anesthesiologists utilize light to moderate sedation."" Only licensed medical doctors who are board-certified anesthesiologists administer anesthesia at the clinic, the statement said. ""Our anesthesiologists monitor the patient continuously utilizing state-of-the-art monitoring equipment, and remain at the bedside throughout the procedure and into recovery,"" it said. The clinic's statement also appeared to address criticism that Rivers should have been treated in a hospital and not a clinic because of her advanced age. ""Yorkville Endoscopy has strict policies in place for the criteria of who gets treated in this center versus in a hospital,"" the statement said. ""Every patient is pre-screened by their gastroenterologist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse for appropriateness to be treated at Yorkville Endoscopy. Some patients are also pre-screened by their personal physicians."" The clinic is also well-equipped and staffed to handle emergencies, including for tracheal intubation when a patient stops breathing, the statement said. ""Yorkville Endoscopy has all necessary airway equipment, including a fiber optic scope available for emergency intubation,"" it said. ""Three to four board certified anesthesiologists are on duty at Yorkville Endoscopy at any given time."" All of its doctors are certified for advance cardiac life support and many of the nurses also work in hospital intensive care units and emergency rooms, it said. Rivers was a pointed, pioneering comedian . Rivers was undergoing an apparently minor elective procedure at the clinic when she suffered cardiac and respiratory arrest, according to the New York Fire Department. Paramedics took her by ambulance to Mount Sinai Hospital, about a mile from the clinic, where she was initially listed in critical condition.  Rivers spent a week on life support before she was pronounced dead on September 4. 25 of Joan Rivers' best jokes . The outpatient clinic is now being investigated by the New York State Department of Health, spokesman James O'Hara said. Rivers' death also has triggered an investigation by the New York medical examiner's office, its spokeswoman, Julie Bolcer, told CNN.

5250,"When Ryan Ferguson and his dad travel this week to Glendale, Arizona, for the Super Bowl, it will be a bucket-list experience. And yet for them it will be so much more. For Ferguson, a Missouri native, it'll be a chance to thank his father, Bill -- the man who never stopped fighting for him while he spent 10 years behind bars for a crime he didn't commit. ""Being able to do this with my father after all he's done for me, sacrificing 10 years of his life to prove my innocence -- that's when it became real,"" said Ferguson. The father-son pilgrimage came about last month when a ticket distributor who had heard about his story offered Ferguson an all-expenses-paid trip to Sunday's game. The 30-year-old, who now lives in Florida, was released from prison in 2013. Ferguson's 12-year nightmare began on November 1, 2001. He and his friend Charles Erickson, both then 17, were drinking illegally at a college bar in Columbia, Missouri. About five blocks away, Columbia Tribune Sports Editor Kent Heitholt turned off his computer after a long night and left the newsroom shortly after 2 a.m., according to court documents. In the newspaper's parking lot, someone struck Heitholt from behind and strangled him with his own belt. Police interviewed a janitor, Jerry Trump, who said he couldn't identify the people involved in the slaying. But two years later, Erickson told police he had ""dream-like"" memories of committing the crime, according to court documents. Ferguson told police that he remembered driving Erickson home before going home himself. But after Erickson implicated him and Trump changed his account, Ferguson was charged with murder and convicted in 2004. When Ryan's father, Bill Ferguson, awoke the day after his son's arrest, he was devastated. ""'Oh my God, I got to get to work,' "" his father, now 70, recalls thinking. ""It's like watching one of your children drowning. I had to do something."" ""I started reading the police reports over and over,"" said the real estate agent. ""I made a timeline and flow chart of all the depositions. I started questioning people on my own, and I dug up a lot of witnesses."" Each week, Ferguson's father visited his son in the maximum-security prison where he was held. They would share updates, compare notes and work on the case together. Ferguson served a quarter of his 40-year sentence while his family and friends campaigned to free him. After two key witnesses admitted that they had lied, a court of appeals overturned his conviction in November 2013 and Ferguson walked free. Erickson is serving a 25-year sentence in a Missouri prison. No one else has ever been charged in the case. ""Can you imagine wiping out everything you did in your 20s?"" Ferguson said. ""That's what it (spending 10 years in prison) is like."" After he was freed, Ferguson did not feel safe in his hometown. The case had gotten a lot of attention locally, and a lot of people knew who he was. Ferguson said he feared the legal system which had put him, an innocent man, in prison. ""I love Columbia, Missouri,"" he told CNN. ""If it wasn't for the authorities, I'd go back."" While in prison, he worked out religiously and began writing his first book, about physical fitness. Upon getting out, he moved to Florida, became a certified personal trainer and earlier this month, published ""Stronger, Faster, Smarter: A Guide to Your Most Powerful Body."" ""The crazy thing is I saw him more when he was in prison,"" said his father, Bill Ferguson, who still lives in Missouri. ""He's been incredibly busy. We get together around once a month."" Football has always been a way to bring the father and son together. ""I played football in college and high school. He was brought up on it,"" Bill Ferguson said. ""It's a vernacular for us, a way for us to get together and have something to talk about."" For the elder Ferguson, the best part of the Super Bowl trip will be getting to spend a few days with his son. ""We'll get to watch one of the greatest sports possible, and we'll get to spend a lot of time, just the two of us, together,"" said his father. Ram Silverman, co-founder of Texas-based Golden Tickets, had watched CBS's ""48 Hours"" special about Ferguson a few years ago. In November, he saw a follow-up about Ferguson being released from prison and wanted to do something nice for him. ""Whatever cost we incur, it's worth it,"" Silverman said. ""He's got an amazing attitude. After talking to him a number of times, I can't wait to meet him."" It took Silverman about a month of trying to connect with Ryan Ferguson on Facebook and other channels before his offer was taken seriously. ""It seemed like one of those things that were too good to be true,"" said Ferguson. ""In my life, I've learned to leave things alone that are too good to be true."" CNN first learned of the news from freelance writer Paul Fitzgerald, who uploaded the story to CNN iReport. At first, Ferguson didn't have much of a reaction to the Super Bowl offer. ""The excitement, joy and happiness didn't hit until I talked to my dad,"" he said. ""We were screaming on the phone, 'Yeahhhhh!' "" While Ryan doesn't have a Super Bowl favorite -- he's just excited to see ""amazing people do amazing things"" -- his dad is rooting for the Seattle Seahawks in their matchup with the New England Patriots. ""When we were in Seattle, we were so impressed with their spirit,"" said Bill Ferguson, referring to a trip in 2014. ""It'd be difficult for us not to be supporters."" The father and son will spend a long weekend together, reveling in football fandom and their shared bond. And making up for lost time. ""Being locked up for 10 years meant no college and I never even sent a text or posted a Facebook update or used a smartphone,"" Ferguson told iReporter Paul Fitzgerald. ""I will get to go to the Super Bowl with my dad. It's a dream come true. This is a golden opportunity and one that I will never, ever forget for the rest of my life.""","Ryan Ferguson spent 10 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit.

24124,"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . Abdul Hanif, 30, from Bradford, has been sentenced to 17 years in jail after being found guilty of keeping a woman as a sex slave . A McDonald's worker has been found guilty of keeping a student as a sex slave for four months  while repeatedly raping and beating her. Abdul Hanif, 30, from Bradford, also planned to force his victim into prostitution to help repay his gambling debts. He was today sentenced to 17 years in jail at Bradford Crown Court after being found guilty of three charges of rape and one of causing actual bodily harm. During his trail, the jury at Bradford Crown Court heard that Hanif's 26-year-old victim was a virgin before he kidnapped and raped her. Jurors were told that the female student had moved to London from Bangladesh to study accountancy. She first met Hanif in February when she was working in a sandwich shop in London and he 'began to groom her', the judge said. The pair exchanged numbers, and after the woman was made homeless Hanif offered to take her to 'a nice new home' in Bradford. In reality the pair spent several days sleeping in Hanif's car and moving between his friends' flats before he moved her to a rented apartment. During this time Hanif took away her credit cards and mobile phone, effectively making her a prisoner, while forcing her to have sex with him every day. The victim said she was made to cook his meals, adding that he would fly into a rage if he was unhappy with what she served. She said Hanif wanted to use her as a prostitute to pay off his gambling debts, and when she refused he tore a phone charger from the wall and strangled her, leaving marks on her throat. She was only freed after managing to contact one of Hanif's former friends, Stephen Naylor, saying she was unwell and had been the victim of domestic violence. He alerted police who went to Hanif's flat in June last year where they battered down the door and found the victim inside. Mr Naylor told the court: 'She said he was treating her like an animal.' He described Hanif as 'charismatic' but added: 'He is a very frightening man and he trusts no-one.' The court heard the victim has had to seek help with counselling after suffering from depression, flashbacks and suicidal thoughts as a result of the treatment she suffered at the hands of Hanif. In a victim impact statement read out to the court, she said: 'I feel as if my life is totally ruined because of what Abdul Hanif did to me. 'Everything in my life has now changed. I can't smile or go anywhere like I could before.' The jury convicted Hanif after just 90 minutes of deliberations following his trial. Jailing him, Judge Peter Benson said: 'Your victim was a young woman who came to London where she had no family and a limited number of friends and she struggled to find her feet. Bradford Crown Court (pictured) heard that Hanif had groomed the student while she worked in a sandwich shop in London. When she became homeless he offered her a place to stay before making her a prisoner . 'You seized this opportunity and lied to her and pretended you had found her a home owned by a friend. Instead of that you brought her against her will to Bradford and when she realised you were leaving London you frightened her and told her you would abandon her. 'This was a young lady who was virtually alone in a big foreign country. You wickedly exploited that vulnerability. You forced her into having sex against her will and when she refused you struck her and threatened her. 'You used her as a sexual resource and you controlled her and isolated her by restricting the use of her phone and locking her in. 'You took her bank card so you had control of her finances, such as they were, and you repeatedly raped her on an almost daily basis using no contraception. 'You treated her like a slave and went off to work, taking the only key. She was a prisoner and had no life at all as you made her cook and clean for you. 'You humiliated her by rejecting the food she cooked  while you satisfied your sexual appetite. 'Eventually when you had gambled away any money that you had, you offered her to a friend for sexual purposes but you then threatened to turn her into a prostitute for funds to feed your gambling addiction. Your threats to turn her into a prostitute finally caused her to find the courage to escape.' Detective Constable Brett Carter, of Protective Services at West Yorkshire Police, said: 'Hanif befriended his victim when she was vulnerable, but then went on to repeatedly rape and assault her. 'This must have been a harrowing ordeal for her and we would like to thank her for the courage she has shown in coming forward and reporting Hanif's crimes. 'We hope the sentence which has been passed down on him today will be of some comfort to her and will help to give her some closure. 'We also hope it will encourage other victims of sexual abuse to speak to our specially-trained officers, who will investigate all reports, no matter how historic, sensitively and thoroughly with the aim of securing a conviction against offenders.' Hanif was also ordered to sign the sex offences register for life.","Abdul Hanif, 30, from Bradford, jailed for 17 years for raping 26-year-old.

56999,"Peace negotiators trying to end Colombia's blood-drenched, five-decade old civil war Sunday announced an agreement on land reform between the Colombian government and FARC rebels. The land reform agreement is the first of six points that negotiators need to broker to reach a peace deal. ""It's a historic change, a rebirth of the Colombian countryside which could lead to an end to the conflict,"" said the government's lead negotiator, Humberto de la Calle. Under the agreement, land not being used would be turned over to poor Colombians to cultivate. The government would provide loans and credits to the farmers. Impoverished areas of the countryside would also receive improvements in infrastructure, health care and housing. De la Calle said land that's privately owned would not be affected. ""Urgent changes to the establishment are knocking on the door of the state, demanding citizen participation in political decisions and choices that would guarantee them a future with dignity,"" said FARC lead negotiator Ivan Marquez. Both sides cautioned Sunday that the land agreement would take effect only if an overall peace deal was reached. Government negotiators said that any deal that is struck would have to first be approved by national referendum before being implemented. The land deal was the first major sign of progress after six months of negotiations between the government and rebels in Havana, Cuba. Cuba and Norway are serving as guarantors for the talks, with Chile and Venezuela acting as observers. ""What has happened so far is part of a greater agreement which we hope to accomplish in the coming months,"" said Cuba's representative to the talks, Carlos Fernandez de Cossio. Negotiators still have to tackle the difficult issues of how FARC rebels would disarm and the future of top rebel leaders who have been sentenced to prison for drug trafficking, murder and kidnapping.

Police in Jimmy Stewart's Pennsylvania hometown slapped a duplicitous duo with a robbery rap Sunday after the lying pair told two shift workers they worked for a fake reality show - You Just Got Robbed - and then stole a measly $20. One of the truth-challenged muggers put an Indiana, Pennsylvania man in a headlock about 1:20 a.m. Sunday morning, while the other recorded the incident on a cellphone.

Fishtale: Duo in Jimmy Stewart's hometown lied about working for a reality show - You Just Got Robbed - before stealing measly $20 from a pair of victims . A third man, who was not arrested, reportedly accompanied Smith and Goodwine, but did not take part in the robbery, police reportedly said. 'There were three guys standing there, and they decided it was going to be a good time to rob us because it was just us two,' one victim, Austin Harnish, told Channel 4 Action News. 'The guys put us in headlocks and said we were going be on a reality TV show. The other guy started filming it on his cellphone.' Smith posted bail, but Goodwine remains in stir at the Indiana County Jail, located about 45 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, The Gazette reported.

19967,"A study of more than 1.3 million births found there were just over seven deaths per 1,000 babies delivered at weekends.
This compared with 6.5 deaths per 1,000 births on weekdays.
The Imperial College London team said if all days had the same death rate as Tuesday, which has the lowest, there would be 770 fewer deaths per year.
The researchers said that while the death rates were low, the difference was significant and raised fresh concerns about standards of care at the weekend.
In September, a separate study suggested that patients admitted for care at weekends had a higher risk of death within 30 days than those admitted during the week.
That research has been used by ministers in their drive to increase the availability of services at weekends - a policy that has put them at loggerheads with the medical profession and led junior doctors to vote in favour of taking strike action, starting from next week.
The latest study - published in the British Medical Journal - looked at the numbers of stillbirths or deaths within seven days in hospital from 2010 to 2012.
It took into account risk factors such as deprivation and the age of the mother, along with the fact that planned Caesarean sections, which carry low risks, normally take place during the week.
In total, there are on average 4,500 deaths a year from 675,000 births.
Infection rates for mothers and injuries to the babies, including anything from cuts to brain damage, were also higher at weekends.
Researchers said they could not identify the cause of the higher risks.
They looked at staffing levels in terms of which hospitals were compliant with the guidelines for consultant cover, and found little difference between those that were and those that were not.
But they said much more data was needed on staffing before it could be ruled out.
Lead researcher Prof Will Palmer said the higher rate of deaths and other problems was ""concerning"" and needed further investigation.
A spokeswoman for NHS England said: ""Most mums say they get excellent NHS maternity care, but for a small number of families that is not the case and it's vital that we take every step to continuously improve quality and safety.
""We have commissioned a wider independent review of NHS maternity services, which will assess how best we can respond to England's growing birth rate and the need for well-staffed and safe services that give mums more say over their care.""
Dr David Richmond, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: ""Although no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these results, they emphasise the need to identify the possible causes in order to ensure that women are receiving high-quality care at any given day of the week.""","The number of stillbirths at weekends in England is at its lowest level in a decade, a study suggests."
52568,"It could prevent more than 50 alcohol-related deaths a year, with poorer people seeing most health improvements.
Researchers from Sheffield University say a 50p unit price could reduce total alcohol consumption in Wales by 4%.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford welcomed the report as the Welsh government plans a new law on the issue for 2015.
Source: Sheffield University report for the Welsh government
Mr Drakeford had unveiled the proposals for a minimum 50p unit price for alcohol in a public health white paper in April.
He said the research published on Monday showed it would have ""significant benefits"" on the nation's health, and built on the advice of the Advisory Panel on Substance Misuse published in July.
""It would mean fewer alcohol-related deaths and ease the burden of alcohol-related harm on the Welsh NHS,"" he said.
""It is no coincidence that as alcohol has become relatively cheaper, alcohol-related deaths and disease have increased.
""We will consider these findings and continue to develop our proposals with a view to introducing legislation.""
It could become law as part of a Public Health Bill for Wales planned for early 2015.
Under the proposed law, shops in Wales would not be allowed to sell a can of beer for less than £1, a bottle of wine for less than £5, or a bottle of spirits for less than £15.
That could lead to a 7% reduction in consumption amongst heavy drinkers -  those most likely to buy cheap alcohol - according to the researchers.
A typical drinker would end up paying around £10 a year more - but the impact could be much bigger on heavier drinkers living in poverty.
Overall it could lead to 1,400 fewer hospital admissions each year.
Coupled with a reduction in crime and sickness absence, the study claims that could reduce the economic impact of alcohol misuse by almost £900m over 20 years.
However a similar plan in Scotland has been challenged in the courts by the drinks industry.","A minimum price for cheap alcohol in Wales could lead to fewer alcohol-related deaths and ease the burden of alcohol-related harm on the Welsh NHS, new research suggests."

53265,"State media said at least 78 people were killed, while a monitoring group put the death toll at more than 145.
Four bombings targeted bus stations in the port city of Tartous and in Jableh, a town to the north, which have until now escaped the worst of the civil war.
A news agency linked to so-called Islamic State (IS) said the jihadist group was behind the attacks.
Amaq cited an IS source as saying militants had targeted ""gatherings of Alawites"", a reference to the heterodox Shia sect to which President Bashar al-Assad belongs.
Russia - a key backer of Mr Assad - has a naval base in Tartous and an airbase near Jableh, from where it has conducted air strikes on IS targets across Syria.
The state news agency, Sana, cited a police source as saying that 45 people were killed and many others, most of them women and children, were injured in Jableh.
It reported that two bombs exploded at the main entrance of the town's bus station.
A suicide bomber also blew himself up at the entrance of the emergency department at Jableh National Hospital, it added.
A doctor at the hospital said it was bombed less than a minute after the bus station.
""Everything went into emergency mode, wounded people began arriving,"" Younes Hassan told the Reuters news agency.
The fourth blast reportedly occurred near the offices of Jableh's electricity directorate, on the outskirts of the Amara residential district.
In Tartous, more than 33 people were killed and 47 injured, Sana said.
A car bomb was detonated at the main gate to the city's bus station, while a suicide bomber detonated an explosive vest inside the facility, it added.
Bus driver Nizar Hamade told Reuters that the blasts occurred no more than 10 seconds apart.
""People began running but didn't know which direction to go, cars were on fire, there was blood and bodies on the ground,"" he added.
Another suicide bomber blew himself up in a western residential area of Tartous, Sana reported.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group which relies on a network of sources on the ground, reported that 97 people were killed in Jableh and another 48 in Tartous.
It also said the two bombings at the bus station in Jableh were suicide attacks.
Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi said terrorist groups were resorting to bomb attacks against civilians because they were unable to fight the Syrian army.
""We will not be deterred,"" he told al-Ikhbariya TV. ""We will use everything we have to fight the terrorists.""
Russia expressed concern at the blasts and said they underscored the need to revive the UN-led peace talks between the government and opposition, which broke down last month amid mounting violence.
""Of course a rise in tension and terrorist activity cannot but heighten concern. It is further proof of how fragile the situation is in Syria and demonstrates the necessity to continue active steps towards resuming talks,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow.
President Vladimir Putin later sent his condolences to Mr Assad and reiterated his readiness to help the Syrian government combat ""the terrorist threat"".

89298,"Australian cricketer David Warner has defended his heated spat with Indian batsman Rohit Sharma saying he 'politely' asked him to 'speak English' - despite admitting he was wrong about the incident that got tempers flaring. The mid-pitch argument was sparked when Warner confronted Sharma about an overthrow after the last ball of the 23rd over on Sunday during the one-day international at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Warner, who has found himself at the centre of more than one sledging controversy this summer, supposedly mouthed-off at the Indian batsman over what he perceived to be poor sportsmanship for running off an overthrow that he believed came from a deflection. 'When I went over to say something to him, he sort of said something in their language and I said, 'Speak English', because, if you're going to say something, understand that theoretically I cannot speak Hindi,' Warner told Sky Sports Radio, according to News Corp. Scroll down for video . The heated spat started when Warner confronted Sharma about an overthrow after the last ball of the 23rd over on Sunday at the Melbourne Cricket Ground with India's score at 3-112 . 'I did the polite thing and asked him to speak English, therefore he did and I can't repeat what he said.' India's belief that it wasn't a deflection was supported by a replay, but Warner says he won't apologise despite making the wrong call. 'I was in the wrong... I shouldn't have engaged him,' he said. 'If people get on the wrong side of me, I'm not going to back down. 'We play hard aggressive cricket but we know what comes with it, sometimes you are going to get fined. 'We've just got to keep trying not to cross that line, because we're all about playing cricket the right way.' There's a so-called unwritten rule in cricket that batsmen don't run overthrows if the ball deflects off their body or bat. While Sharma hesitated at first, he followed through with the run. Warner immediately looked on in disbelief as he walked over from his fielding position. As he walked past Sharma he said something and the Indian batsman's response prompted Warner to double back. Warner was caught on camera repeatedly mouthing: 'What? Speak English'. Umpires Khumar Dharmasena and John Ward were forced to intervene and Australian captain George Bailey had to move Warner away from the Indian batsman. Warner was fined 50 per cent of his match fee over the incident.

The two teams have faced racially-fuelled trouble in the past with Indian off spinner Harbhajan Singh being banned for three Tests back in 2008 for calling Australia's Andrew Symonds a 'monkey'. New Zealand cricket great Martin Crowe weighed in on the stoush labelling Warner the most juvenile cricketer he has seen. Crowe says he fears that the left-hander could be at the centre of a fight during the World Cup if things boil over and is advocating a soccer-like yellow and red card system to deal with what he terms 'thuggish behaviour' as fines don't work.

'I don't care how good he is: if he continues to show all those watching that he doesn't care, he must be removed, either by Cricket Australia or definitely by the world governing body.

Australia were cruising when they needed 50 runs off the final 10 overs with seven wickets in hand, but the tourists fought back boldly to reduce that equation to 14 runs off 11 balls. Faulkner responded with two boundaries, enhancing his status as Australia's closer as they passed their victory target of 268  with an over to spare. Aaron Finch scored 96 and his 101-run partnership with Steve Smith piloted Australia to a point where they needed 52 runs from 63 deliveries.

More than 55% of voters dismissed the so-called personhood initiative.
Mississippi already has tough abortion regulations and a single clinic that performs the procedure.
Correspondents say that even if the amendment had passed it would have faced legal challenges, as it contradicts the right to abortion established by the Roe v Wade Supreme Court ruling of 1973.
Voters on Tuesday were asked: ""Should the term 'person' be defined to include every human being from the moment of fertilization, cloning, or the functional equivalent thereof?""
Backers of the amendment to the state's constitution had collected more than 100,000 signatures from registered voters to introduce it to the ballot.
The amendment could have also led to the banning of some birth control methods in Mississippi.
It had attracted strong support in the conservative and religious state.
A poll taken before the vote found that 45% of voters in Mississippi backed the measure, 44% were against, and 11% undecided.
The state's Democratic and Republican candidates for governor, who also ran for election on Tuesday, both came out in favour of the amendment.
Voters elected Republican Phil Bryant to succeed outgoing Governor Haley Barbour. Mr Bryant had been quoted as telling supporters that ""Satan wins"" if the personhood measure failed.

""There's nine back-row forwards and not one Scot? There must be something wrong there,"" Telfer, who led the 1983 tour to New Zealand, told BBC Scotland.
""Scottish rugby should really feel as if they've been badly let down.""
Gatland has chosen 16 England players, 12 from Wales and 11 from Ireland for the tour that runs from 3 June to 8 July, featuring three Tests against the All Blacks, who are world champions.
Scotland finished fourth, above Wales, in this season's Six Nations and Telfer thought Hamish Watson and John Barclay were unlucky to miss out.
""I'm very, very disappointed considering there's 41 players there and we haven't got one forward out of the 22 or whatever it is forwards,"" said the Scot.
""The fact that we won three games and we beat Ireland and Wales. It's not good for Scottish rugby at all.
""Watson, Barclay are obviously candidates who should've been given consideration, so I am a wee bit angry because it doesn't represent British rugby.
""Forty or 39 of the players, I agree with. They're very good players and somebody has to lose out and I'm not against that at all.
""If he wanted to have some exciting new players, Finn Russell would've been right up there, but he's gone for the tried and tested. I think there's more creative players that could've been there and he hasn't chosen them.""
Former Scotland player Gregor Townsend, who will leave Glasgow Warriors in the summer to replace New Zealander Vern Cotter as Scotland head coach, turned down the chance to be involved in the Lions tour.
And Telfer feels Gatland should have had someone involved to represent Scotland.
""Vern Cotter could've been part of his coaching squad - he hasn't asked him,"" said Telfer.
""He's not actually doing all that much during the summer. Gregor, in my opinion, was right not to go because he's taking the Scottish team for the first time.
""He should've got somebody on that selection committee from Scotland. He didn't need to be a coach, or a coach on the tour, but there's bound to be people who could've represented Scotland on that selection committee.""
Telfer coached Scotland in the 1980s and 90s, led the 1983 Lions tour of New Zealand and was also involved in the 1997 tour of South Africa.

77070,"He grew up there with a family so poor, they often went to bed having only drunk warm water for dinner. To earn money, he dropped out of school as a teenager to fight at local fiestas for a winning purse of 100 pesos, or less than $4 (Â£2.60).
In a sign of how far he's come, this weekend he earned at least $100m in the ""fight of the century"" against American rival Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather Jr. The highly anticipated bout took about half a decade to organise and is the richest event in the history of boxing.
Pacquiao wasn't able to defeat Mayweather. Despite his loss, the 36-year-old remains a hero in locals' eyes and there is speculation he may turn to politics and possibly run for president in the coming years.
Following his sporting success, he's become so influential in the Philippines it can be said that he single-handedly boosts the economy each time he fights.
Some analysts have gone so far as to claim the Philippines' currency the peso rises ahead of his matches. One media report said the peso strengthened against the US dollar in six out of 10 of his last critical fights.
Whenever Pacquiao enters the ring, the South East Asian nation is famously said to come to a virtual standstill. This past weekend was no different. The normally gridlocked streets of its capital, Manila, stood mostly empty in the hours leading up to and during his match against Mayweather.
Across the country, millions gathered in private homes, town halls, schools, cinemas and stadiums to watch him fight across the Pacific, cheering loudly each time he managed to land a blow on his arch rival.
It is estimated that seven out of 10 people in the Philippines watched the match on Sunday. And that level of viewership translates into a lot of money.
Tickets to the match at the MGM Grand Garden in Vegas officially ranged from $1,500 to $10,000. They were sold out in minutes.
In the Philippines, most people would never be able to afford that. It is estimated that more than a quarter of its population live under the poverty line, or with less than $2 a day.
However, many paid out of pocket to watch the Pacquiao-Mayweather match at home, a bar, hotel or casino, and a variety of businesses have cashed in.
Sky Cable charged a pay-per-view rate of 2,500 pesos. Others paid 800 pesos per head to watch Sunday's fight in a cinema. Operator SM Prime Holdings said it sold 100,000 tickets for showings in 200 of its 300 cinemas.
Even the Philippines' biggest power distributor Manila Electric (Meralco) benefited. It said electricity usage is about 10% higher during Pacquiao fights. On the islands of Palawan and Mindanao, residents were advised to turn off their refrigerators to save electricity ahead of the match due to intermittent power outages.
Then there are the lucrative sponsorship deals.
When Pacquiao first went professional, he only had one advertiser willing to pay for their logo to feature on his trunks. In Las Vegas on Sunday, they generated about $2.5m after at least six companies paid for a space on his shorts, including Philippines telecoms giant Smart Communications.
It's also impossible to escape his mug in the sprawling capital of Manila; its plastered on flyers in shopping malls and in multiple sections of the daily newspapers. Brands such as Nike, Rexona and Nestle's Butterfinger Peanut Butter Cups also hawk merchandise with his name or likeness on them.
Small businesses have benefited from the ""Pac Man effect"" as well.
In a small shopping mall in Quezon City, a suburb of Manila, the Bunny Baker cafÃ© has seen an increase in traffic after its owners created a life-sized cake of the boxer.
""I think Pacquiao is phenomenal for the economy,"" co-owner Zach Yonzon said.
""Whenever there is a fight, everybody goes out. If you're not watching at home, you're going outside to eat at a restaurant.
""When Filipinos are happy, they spend money,"" he added with a smile.
The biggest and simplest way Pacquiao contributes to the local economy is through taxes.
As one of the world's most highly-paid athletes, Pacquiao is the Philippines' top individual taxpayer despite having been accused of under-declaring his income.
He drew $42m in earnings last year, according to Forbes, a figure that will exponentially increase following his fight with Mayweather. Their bout was the richest in boxing history having generated as much as half-a-billion dollars.
Pacquiao, who dropped out of high school aged 14, has also demonstrated business savvy over the years.
In General Santos, known as the country's tuna capital because of its fishing industry, Pacquiao has set up a gym and hotel, where you can buy an ""8 World Title"" or ""Pound for Pound"" Pacquiao burger at its Roadhaus restaurant.
The poverty that Pacquiao famously grew up in is long gone. Now he lives in large mansions and will never go hungry again. And that's why he has captured the Philippines' consciousness.
His is the true Cinderella story, and millions of Filipinos still aspire to emulate his escape from grinding poverty and make their own mark on the world stage.","In the Philippines, Manny Pacquiao was born into a poor family."
51908,"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:58 EST, 1 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:41 EST, 15 May 2012 . A study has found that the use of Tasers, once known as 'non-lethal' devices can cause cardiac arrest and death. The study, conducted by Dr Douglas Zipes, and appearing in American Heart Association's medical journal, analysed information such as autopsy reports, medical records and police data in cases where people had lost consciousness after being shocked by the Taser X26 model. About 334 Taser-related deaths have been reported between 2001 and 2008, according to Amnesty International. The study by Dr Douglas Zipes examined the effects of the X26 Taser model on people . Dr Zipes also notes that unlike guns, Tasers are not subject to regulation by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms because they don’t involve the use of gun powder. Circulation, the AHA's own medical journal, published the findings in what is believed to be the first peer-reviewed study linking the devices to heart trauma and death. An evaluation of the X26 in pigs, sheep and people established that shocks to the chest caused cardiac electrical capture. Ex-Marine Kenneth Chamberlain died last year after he was shot by stun guns in New York . Dr Zipes conducted the study to raise awareness about the fact that Tasers can be dangerous. He told the Cincinnati Enquirer: 'The only way I felt anyone would pay attention would be an article in a respected journal by a respected cardiologist.' The doctor added:  'In no way am I condemning Taser. That decision must be done by law enforcement experts, not a physician. What I want people to be aware of is that there is the potential for death.' In 2009, Taser first implied that its products may be linked to cardiac arrest when the company asked officers to refrain from aiming the weapon at a suspect’s chest. But Taser officials contended that the advisory only meant that law-enforcement agencies could avoid controversy if officers aimed at areas other than the chest. Critics called it a stunning reversal for the company. Last month, gay porn star Marland . Anderson, who is known as Sledge Hammer, died five days after a violent . altercation with police which resulted in him being shot with a Taser. Sad: The 39-year-old had allegedly been dealing with depression, which was exacerbated by his marijuana use . Last year, Former Marine Kenneth Chamberlain Sr was allegedly shot by a Taser at his White Plains, New York, apartment after he had accidentally triggered his LifeAid pendant. Chamberlain, who had also worked as a correction officer, died in a nearby hospital on November 19. Hundreds of Taser-related deaths have been reported in recent years, and have risen due to increased use by cops and security officials.

812,"Having trouble pronouncing an Italian word? If you sit on the Supreme Court, consult an expert. On Monday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor was announcing the court's opinion in Krupski v. Costa Crociere SpA (09-337), a lesser-known appeal dealing with the scope of the right to file an amended lawsuit to correct a mistake in a party's identity. The newest justice was having trouble pronouncing the name of the cruise ship company at the center of the case. Costa Cruises is a British and American-owned firm based in Genoa, Italy, where it is registered as Costa Crociere SpA. The appeal involved passenger Wanda Krupksi, who tripped over a cable and fractured her leg in 2007 aboard the Costa Magica. At issue was whether Krupski should have sued Costa Cruises or Costa Crociere SpA in federal court. The justice writing the majority ruling typically announces the decision from the bench in a public session, with a brief oral summary that supplements the official written opinion. That's where the fun began. Sotomayor needed help and knew exactly where to turn. ""Costa Cruises responded that she should have sued a related company called Costa ... I'm going to ask my colleague Justice Scalia to say it right,"" Sotomayor said. ""Kroo-chee-ER-ay,"" said Scalia, who is of Sicilian descent and has written a book on how lawyers can shine verbally when presenting their appeals before judges. ""Kroo-chee-ER-ay,"" the first Hispanic justice slowly but correctly repeated. ""I want to put the Spanish accent on it."" Sotomayor has privately told friends that she was pleasantly surprised when joining the court at how friendly and collegial her benchmates have been, welcoming her to their exclusive club. Scalia is among the most verbally adept justices, peppering his bench remarks with humor and well-reasoned legal conclusions. His father was a professor of Romance languages in Queens, New York. Sotomayor, meanwhile, was honored over the weekend in the Bronx, where she grew up. She visited her grade school and then attended a ceremony at the Bronxdale Houses public housing project. It has now been renamed the Justice Sonia Sotomayor Houses and Community Center. She was visibly moved when talking about growing up there and meeting the late Robert F. Kennedy, who had come there in 1958 to tour the projects. The justice, who turns 56 this month, also gave the commencement address at Hostos Community College, where her mother graduated with a nursing degree in 1974. It has primarily served the Spanish-speaking community in New York. By the way, in the Crociere case, the high court ruled unanimously for Krupski. ""Costa Crociere should have known that Krupski's failure to name it as a defendant in her original complaint was due to a mistake concerning the proper party's identity,"" Sotomayor said, with admirable pronunciation.","Sotomayor was announcing the court's opinion in Krupski v.

Linesmen and referees can make errors due to hot and cold conditions, a new UEFA report claims - and urges that officials be allowed to double up numbers or be supported by goal line technology. The finding could have important implications for controversial decisions such as Diego Maradona's infamous 'Hand of God' goal - and for the upcoming 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Professor John Brewer of the University of Bedfordshire said, 'We need to look at ways to help them cope with the conditions that they will face.' Diego Maradona's infamous 'hand of God' goal past Peter Shilton: A new report presented to UEFA suggests that referees can make bad decisions in hot climates . John Brewer, of the University of Bedfordshire, found that physical performance and decision making of referees and linesmen were impaired when conditions were hot - similar to those likely to be found at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, or cold, as is often the case in Champions and Europa League. He was funded for the study by the European football governing body, UEFA. He presented his findings to its Medical Commission in Geneva prior to next month’s European Championships in in Poland and Ukraine. Professor Brewer said: ‘These findings have serious implications for the performance of referees and goal line officials who are officiating in challenging climatic conditions. It could be argued that this even lends further weight to the argument in favour of goal line technology in important matches.’ Professor Brewer pointed out the referees and goal line officials would have to work in extremely hot conditions while taking part in the World Cup in Qatar in 2022. However, cold climates can also cause problems. ‘The decision making of the goal line officials would also be cause for concern if they are working in the cold conditions seen in the Championships and Europa leagues. Our findings show that they are at risk of hyperthermia and making incorrect decisions, especially in the second half, ‘ he said. John Brewer, of the University of Bedfordshire, found that physical performance and decision making of referees and linesmen were impaired when conditions were hot - similar to those likely to be found at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar . He said pre-match and half time cooling in hot conditions would lessen the chance of a referee making a mistake. He also recommended that all match officials should receive appropriate education in hydration strategies. For officials working in cold conditions, Professor Brewer suggested that they should be permitted to wear additional clothing and, potentially, for four officials to be considered per match, rather than the current two, allowing each to only officiate for 45 minutes. Professor Brewer added: ‘When matches are played in extremely hot and cold conditions, the football authorities should observe the physical condition of match officials to ensure they are able to continue officiating effectively which may include measuring body temperature at half time. ‘The ultimate aim must be to protect the health of the officials, and ensure that they are in the best possible state to make correct decisions.’",Physical performance and decision making impaired in hot and cold climates.

41293,"What colour is snow? At first, it seems like an easy answer. Anyone who has seen snow will know it is white, the reason being because it reflects almost all visible light incident upon it. But if you’ve ever dug a deep hole in snow and looked down, you will have noticed that sometimes it can actually appear blue - and sometimes even red, in other circumstances - but why? Dreaming of a white Christmas? Don't dig too deep into snow, or you might start to notice a bluish tint. This is due to more and more of the ice crystals in the snow reflecting blue light, and absorbing other types, although of course in this image the effect is amplified by the shadows as well . As mentioned, snow appears white because it reflects most visible light that strikes it. Anything that does this means you see the whole spectrum of visible light, which looks white. Snowflakes are understood to be unique - at a molecular level at least. But scientists have revealed that each and every one of them can in fact be sorted into 35 general shapes, which in turn tell experts how they formed. The shapes, which include column crystals, irregular snow particles and plane crystals - which make ‘traditional’ hexagonal snowflakes - vary according to temperature and humidity. Bournemouth-based chemistry teacher Andy Brunning, created an infographic based on recent research to show the different shapes, which he published on his blog, Compound Interest. It shows 39 types of ‘solid precipitation’ or snow, including the 35 types of snowflakes and their names, which can be further divided into 121 subtypes. Simpler snowflake shapes such as germ of ice crystals, are more common at low humidities, while more complex flakes, such as plane crystals are formed in areas of high humidity. Other objects appear different colours because they absorb certain wavelengths of visible light but reflect others - a green apple, for instance, reflects only mostly the green wavelength. But, as reported by JSTOR, when snow is deep enough it can actually appear blue. The reason for this is due to ice crystals in the snow, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) ‘As light waves travel into the snow or ice, the ice grains scatter a large amount of light,’ the NSIDC explains. While most of the light is reflected, there is a very small tendency towards more red light being absorbed than blue. When you see just the surface of a pack of snow, the scattering of the blue light is almost completely impossible to notice. But if you look into a significant amount of snow, about 3.3ft (one metre) or so, more photons emerge towards the blue end of the spectrum than the red end. ‘For instance, if you were to poke a hole in the snow and look down into the hole, you may see a bluish colour,’ said the NSIDC. While most of the light that is incident upon snow and ice is reflected, there is a very small tendency towards more red light being absorbed than blue, giving a slight bluish tint in deep snow and ice, such as this image from South Georgia Island in Antarctica . ‘As light waves travel into the snow or ice, the ice grains scatter a large amount of light,’ the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) explains. Shown is a slight bluish tint in a melting glacier in East Greeland . When snow appears red, though, it is for an entirely different reason. This effect is due to cold-loving, fresh-water algae known as Chlamydomonas nivalis that contain a bright red pigment. Also known as ‘watermelon snow’, it is ‘most common during the summertime in high alpine areas as well as along coastal polar regions’. Interestingly, C. nivalis cells actually appear green under a microscope. The reason they appear pink in snow to our eyes is due to a biochemical called beta-carotene. It protects the algae’s chlorophyll from the sun’s rays, but in the process gives them a red or pinkish hue, rather than green. Be careful not to eat watermelon snow, though - it can act as a laxative. When snow appears red, though, it is for an entirely different reason. This effect is due to cold-loving, fresh-water algae known as Chlamydomonas nivalis (shown) that contain a bright red pigment . Also known as ‘watermelon snow’ , red snow is most common during the summertime in high alpine areas as well as along coastal polar regions. Shown is red snow in the Dolomites, Italy . Red snow can also be caused by iron-rich seawater, such as Blood Falls in Antarctica’s Taylor Glacier, shown, where the water leaks from an ancient reservoir under the glacier. The iron oxidises when it comes into contact with the atmosphere, turning red . Last year, meanwhile, a Washington photographer  spent two month living in a remote base in Antarctica to reveal how the area can be surprisingly colourful. Gaston Lacombe captured incredible images showing the bright pinks, greens and reds of the area - caused by everything from penguin poo to massive blooms of algae. Mr Lacombe told MailOnline he was invited to the remote base by the Government of Argentina as its artist in residence. The Canadian photographer now based in Washington, D.C. spent two months at Esperanza Base, a permanent research station on Antarctica’s Trinity Peninsula. Gaston Lacombe spent two months at Esperanza Base, a permanent research station on Antarctica’s Trinity Peninsula, to capture amazing images of coloured snow last year. Here, the red snow effect is caused by the algae Chlamydomonas nivalis . The red colour doesnt always come from algae, however. Adelie penguins transiting to and from the sea shore colour the surface of the snow with whatever substance they drag with their feet. The pink colour here is from penguin poo, since they eat mostly krill, a small type of shrimp .","When snow is deep enough, it can actually appear blue.

From the dilapidated state of LaGuardia's Central Terminal Building to the minimal public transport links and outdated air traffic control system, the metro area's airports are in desperate need of modernization. But now it's time for Biden and other leaders to put their money where their rhetoric is. The Federal Government and local politicians must step up and take sustained action. And the goal should be to fix the problem, not point fingers. Despite its outdated condition, LaGuardia serves 25 million passengers a year. As the closest airport to Manhattan, it is coveted by airlines. Moreover, New York City's three major airports serve more than 110 million people a year, account for 500,000 jobs and contribute $63 billion to our regional economy, according to a November 2013 study from Global Gateway Alliance and Partnership for New York City. And they are the largest global gateway to the world for international travelers, with U.S. Customs data showing that John F. Kennedy International Airport handles the most international visitors and Newark International Airport the fifth most. As such, the airports serve as a symbol for the entire United States. Airports are responsible for the first and last impressions visitors have, and in New York, some 54 million tourists visited last year. They are fundamentally vital to our economy, tourism industry and our global reputation. As the vice president pointed out, New York's airports are a symbol of underinvestment in infrastructure throughout the country. When the Beatles landed in New York 50 years ago last week, our airports were a symbol of the modern, efficient and forward-looking transportation infrastructure in the United States. Now, they are the embodiment of our falling behind the rest of the world. Cities all over the world have recognized the significance of their airports and have invested in state-of-the-art technology and infrastructure. Our own Global Gateway Alliance survey showed that airports from Singapore to Paris are providing innovative amenities such as 40 foot slides, ice skating rinks and on airport baby strollers to ensure that passengers have the best possible experience. The same survey showed LaGuardia and New York area airports at the bottom of the list of passenger amenities. The bottom line is we to have to invest in our airports to avoid losing out to national and international competitors and to provide a better quality of life for those millions of passengers.

More than a 100 premises were damaged and looted earlier this week.
Greater Manchester Police said on Saturday there had been 208 arrests so far in connection with the rioting and 134 people had been charged.
A youth handed himself in after his friend saw his picture on the advertising vans and called him to say his image was all over Manchester, police said.
Also among the new arrests are a 13-year-old girl who has been charged with burglary and a 14-year-old boy who was detained by Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan, who also recovered stolen trainers with the tags still on.
The boy, who cannot be named, remains in custody on suspicion of burglary following a theft at the Foot Locker store in Manchester city centre.
Mr Shewan said: ""We said we would be coming for you, and we are.
""Within minutes of the ad van being launched in Manchester with the faces of some of those people involved, we have been inundated with information from members of the public about who these people are.
""These are just some of the good arrests we have made.""
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is visiting Manchester to meet some of those affected.
Mr Clegg visited Olive Delicatessen in Whitworth Street, a family-run business near the city centre.
He spoke to Tuesday Steel, who runs it with her children, Victoria and James.
Victoria Steel, 25, told Mr Clegg she was at home that night but rushed into town when she saw a picture linked to Twitter of riot police leaving the Olive premises after it was attacked.
She said: ""Somebody had taken a picture of the riot police leaving and I thought, 'I've got to go down, I'm not going to sit around and wait until tomorrow to find out what damage has been done'.""
Rioters had smashed their way into the shop, causing thousands of pounds of damage by breaking doors, windows and glass panels.
Ms Steel said she was so outraged she went straight to the shop with a friend.
""There were thugs, gangs on the park, and I went straight into the shop and found a guy in there,"" she said.
""He was behind the counter, looking for money or anything to steal. I screamed at him to get out, which he did.""

""While we will not go into the details of individual cases, the violations of the Navy's substance abuse policies included use and possession,"" Carpenter said in a statement. ""These cases involved 'spice,' which is considered a banned substance by the departments of Defense and Navy."" ""Spice,"" also known as K2, is a mixture of herbs and spices that typically is sprayed with a synthetic compound chemically similar to THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, according to a Drug Enforcement Administration fact sheet. ""K2 is commonly purchased in head shops, tobacco shops, various retail outlets and over the Internet,"" the DEA said. ""It is often marketed as incense or 'fake weed.'"" Its effects on the body are similar to that of marijuana. The midshipmen included juniors and sophomores, Carpenter said. The academy, located in Annapolis, Maryland, did not identify them. On whether they will have to repay the cost of their education, Carpenter said the decision is up to the Department of the Navy. ""Consistent with Navy policy, the Naval Academy has a zero tolerance policy regarding illicit drug use or possession,"" Carpenter said. The investigation is ongoing, he said.

Miss Johnson's body was found on Saturday, a few days after her mother, Dianna, who lived in the upstairs part of the Stow home with her, had last heard from her. An autopsy showed she had died from sharp-force neck trauma. The murder weapon has not been found. 'It was a pretty violent crime scene,' police chief Louis . Dirker told Ohio.com. 'It was obvious there was a lot of passion involved. Passion is the best way I can put it. It was obviously a lot of . passion.' The motive for the killing is not clear, but Buck had recently been asked to leave the property after falling behind on rent. She allegedly told police she wasn't bothered about being evicted, and had been due to move out in April. Crime scene: Michelle Johnson and Buck, who is accused of killing her, both lived in this Stow house . Discovered: Michelle's body was found dumped in this shed behind the house . Police believe that after the killing, which is thought to have taken place Friday, Buck went to her job at a Burger King, 19 Action News reported. When she was first questioned by police, Buck was described as being 'cooperative but evasive'. Officers later found blood from the victim on books inside Buck's car. Buck, who has a previous arrest for domestic violence, is being held in jail on $1 million bond.","Roxanne Buck, 44, charged with murder and tampering with evidence.

43885,"The state-run Saudi Press Agency said the money was to be used by the Lebanese army to buy French weapons.
A $1bn deal to equip the internal security forces is also being stopped.
The official said the Sunni-ruled kingdom had noted the ""confiscation of the will"" of the Lebanese state by the Iran-backed Shia Hezbollah movement.
Lebanon's national unity government, which includes Hezbollah and its allies, declined to condemn attacks on Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran last month by protesters angered by the execution of a prominent Shia cleric in Saudi Arabia.
The $3bn aid programme announced in 2013 was intended to help the Lebanese army strengthen its capabilities against jihadist militants encroaching from neighbouring Syria.
The first tranche of weapons, including Milan anti-tank guided missiles, was delivered last April, but after that the programme ran into obstacles, according to the AFP news agency.
On Friday, SPA quoted an unnamed official as saying Saudi Arabia had always stood with Lebanon and supported the country through difficult times.
""Despite these honourable stands, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia had been met with Lebanese stands that are against it on Arab, regional and international arenas, in the shadow of the confiscation of the will of the state by the so-called Lebanese Hezbollah,"" the official said.
At recent meetings of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Co-operation, Lebanon had failed to condemn ""the blatant attacks on the kingdom's embassy in Tehran and the consulate in Mashhad, which are contrary to international law and diplomatic norms"", the official added.
""Saudi Arabia considers these positions as regrettable and unjustified.""
The decision not to sign Saudi-drafted resolutions condemning the attacks was made by Lebanese Foreign Minister Gibran Bassil. He is the president of the Christian Free Patriotic Movement, one of Hezbollah's strongest allies.","Saudi Arabia has stopped a $3bn aid programme to Lebanon, a Lebanese official has said."
75388,"Blissett has been relegated to the substitutes' bench since the arrival of Kieffer Moore on loan.
But the target man came on to inspire the Gulls to just their second away victory of the season.
""When he came on, it turned the game around in our favour,"" Nicholson told BBC Radio Devon.
Blissett scored eight goals in 16 league starts for the Gulls last season, helping Torquay stave off relegation.
But this season he has struggled to repeat that form, while Moore has now scored five goals in four games since joining on loan from Forest Green.
""He set up two other great chances, if not three, he's worked and worked and worked and he's allowed Kieffer to get hold of it,"" added Nicholson.
""It's probably strange being the 6ft 4in usual target to then being the guy that's playing off the big man, so it's a change for him, but I thought he was fantastic when he came on.""","Torquay United boss Mark Nicholson says he was ""fantastic"" when striker Chris Blissett came on to help his side to a 1-0 win over Torquay."

The ""zones"" would mean anyone caught walking their dog in the areas listed could face a fine of up to Â£80.
Some of the 96 areas proposed include the Knockagh Monument on the outskirts of Carrickfergus, as well as parts of Carnfunnock Country Park in Larne.
Playing fields and community centres in Ballymena, Greenisland and Whitehead are also included.
The consultation, which is open to the public until 19 June, has caused controversy among some dog owners.
Philip Thompson, the director of environmental services at the council, said: ""Dog control issues, particularly the whole issue of fouling, are something that our elected members and officers are continually getting complaints about.
""So these dog control orders are there to try and deal with that issue.""
He said the council would engage with people worried about the zones.
""This is a four-week consultation and we will genuinely listen and genuinely take on board those concerns,"" he said.
""If there are areas that shouldn't be on those, then we can remove them, but that will come back to council for a final decision.""","Dog owners in County Antrim are to be banned from walking their dogs in 96 ""dog control zones""."

5657,"Michael Piggin, from Loughborough, was accused of two counts of terrorism which included plans to attack his former school, a mosque and a cinema.
The 18-year-old had previously pleaded guilty to possessing explosives.
The prosecution confirmed there would be no retrial after the jury failed to reach a verdict after 11 days.
During the trial at the Old Bailey prosecuting lawyer Max Hill QC said Piggin had plotted a ""Columbine-style massacre"" in the Leicestershire town.
He showed weapons found in his bedroom and videos of the teenager making Neo-Nazi salutes and shouting 'EDL' outside a mosque.
Following a raid at his home in Beaumont Road, Shelthorpe, police found several air rifles, component parts of pipe bombs, a crossbow and a swastika flag hung above his bed.
Piggin, who was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome after his arrest in February last year, said he wrote about attacks to cope with bullying and tested explosives ""for entertainment"".
Videos shown during the case showed him throwing petrol bombs behind a leisure centre and writing racist graffiti on a wall.
The teenager denied possessing articles for a purpose connected with terrorism and having a Mujahideen Poisons Handbook, which is banned under terrorism laws.
Throughout the trial Piggin denied any real plans for attacks and said it had all ""just been in his head"".
He said he ""didn't have a problem with Muslims in general"" and described racist comments made on videos as ""banter"".
On Friday the judge dismissed the jury after they said there was ""no real prospect of them ever reaching a verdict that they agreed on"".
This latest trial was a retrial after a previous jury failed to reach a verdict in November.
Det Chief Insp Will Catterton, from the counter terrorism unit, said: ""We obviously treated this very seriously indeed.
""Anything of this type where a person is putting together items such as improvised explosive devices, one has to assume that they can prove fatal if handled incorrectly or if someone has a particular mindset to use them, it can result in a loss of life.""
Piggin will be sentenced for three counts of possessing explosives and one of carrying a knife in the street on 13 June.","A teenager has been found guilty of plotting a ""Columbine-style massacre"" in a Leicestershire town."
23237,"Mr Justice Mostyn said some G4S employees at Brook House, near Gatwick Airport, had ""behaved disgracefully"".
His criticism came in a written ruling after a failed asylum seeker took legal action against the home secretary.
G4S said it had suspended two members of staff ""with immediate effect"".
Details of the case emerged following a High Court judicial review hearing in London nearly two weeks ago.
Mr Justice Mostyn said the anonymous asylum seeker was taken from his room at Brook House in October 2010 and flown out of the country.
His room was then cleared and, as is standard procedure, every item removed was put in a bag and recorded on a certificate.
The judge said the certificate was prepared and signed by a member of staff.
He said it clearly showed that ""various paperwork"" was collected.
""The certificate was later corruptly redacted in order to eradicate the reference to 'various paperwork',"" the judge said.
Three G4S staff members - Marilyn Bennett, Matthew Newman and Tamara Burns - are named in the judgment. Marilyn Bennett is no longer employed by the firm.
In early November 2011, the three made identical witness statements on behalf of the Secretary of State.
Mr Newman and Ms Burns gave oral evidence on oath and were cross-examined.
In their witness statements, they each said: ""If any documentation was removed from the claimant's room it would have been clearly referred to on the attached certificate.
""Having looked at the room clearance certificate I am confident that no documentation would have been removed from the claimant's room.""
Mr Justice Mostyn said: ""The conduct of the Secretary of State's agents in falsifying the room clearance certificate is corrupt and truly shocking.
""When agents of the state falsify documents it undermines, if not fatally, then certainly very seriously, the trust of the people in the operation of the rule of law.
""It makes no difference if, as here, the agents are private contractors to whom the Secretary of State has outsourced her powers.
""In this case I am satisfied that there is prima facie evidence of the offence of forgery and I direct that a copy of this judgment be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions along with the relevant documents.
""Further, to make a false witness statement is a contempt of court. Proceedings for such contempt are a matter for the Attorney General, and I direct that this judgment and the relevant papers be sent to him also.""
Mr Justice Mostyn dismissed the asylum seeker's claim for damages and said he lacked credibility.
In a statement, the Home Office said: ""While we are pleased that the court has ruled in our favour, we are concerned with the reports of staff misconduct.
""Although our staff were not directly involved we expect our contractors to maintain the highest standards of integrity and professionalism.
""Any allegations of wrongdoing must be thoroughly investigated and dealt with accordingly.""
A G4S spokesman said: ""The allegations made in respect of the conduct of our employees are extremely serious, and we have launched an immediate internal investigation.
""Due to the nature of these allegations, we have suspended the two personnel concerned with immediate effect, pending the outcome of the investigation.
""We will of course cooperate fully with any inquiries the appropriate authorities may pursue in connection with this case.""",The Home Office has been ordered to send documents to the Director of Public Prosecutions after a High Court judge ruled in the case of staff at a London hotel.
93974,"When it comes to getting ahead at work, it seems many women lack the confidence to ask for a pay rise or a promotion. Despite an increasing success in the corporate world, a survey has found the glass ceiling still looms with nearly a fifth of women (17 per cent) believing it's impossible for a woman to reach senior management. The research also found that more than a third (36 per cent) of women aren't climbing the career ladder because they aren't confident to ask their bosses for more. Over a third of women said their lack of confidence stopped them from asking for a promotion or pay rise . According to the study, which was carried out by O2, this lack of self-esteem is stopping women workers from asking for the promotion or pay rise they feel they deserve. Further highlighting this crisis in confidence, luck was by far the biggest reason attributed to success. Qualities such as skill, hard work, talent and ambition hardly featured in the responses of the 2,000 women polled. Management consultant, Emily, 27, who used to work in Westminster, knows how it feels to struggle with confidence. 'I only realised my confidence was holding me back when a more junior male colleague asked for a double promotion, which would have put him above me, whereas I hadn’t even thought about going for the job myself. He didn't get it, but it was a wake up call.' Despite women's increased success in the corporate world, the dreaded glass ceiling still looms with nearly a fifth of women (17 per cent) believing it's impossible for a woman to reach senior management . Emily puts her lack of self-esteem in the workplace down to the male-dominated environment she worked in: . 'Often, I would be the only woman in meetings and male colleagues would be making laddish jokes and I would be ignored and spoken over. 'I thought it meant I didn’t have a valid or valuable contribution. It drained my confidence.' In response to the findings, O2 is launching Breaking the Boardroom: A Guide For British Businesses . Despite women often displaying  self-doubt at work, they still dream big. Nearly a third of women said they aspired to be the CEO (28 per cent) or on the board of a company (35 per cent). However, when asked about their own career, a third (32 per cent) revealed that it had failed to meet their expectations. Poor quality line management (33 per cent), a lack of effective training and development programmes (22 per cent), and negative office politics (28 per cent) were the main reasons women felt hindered their progression. Half (48 per cent) of women polled also believed all the decision-makers in their company are male. In response to the findings, O2, in association with the CIPD, The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, is launching Breaking the Boardroom: A Guide For British Businesses on how to support female leaders of the future. Along with insights from 2000 working women, the guide incorporates insights from O2, the CIPD, and a coalition of contributors made up of senior businesswomen from a range of roles and industries including IT, law and engineering. The guide provides advice to businesses of all sizes looking to implement their own programmes to help women reach leadership roles. Christine O'Brien, partner at Baker & McKenzie LLP who contributed to the guide, said: 'We're dealing with a proportion of the population with a genuine disability – an acute lack of confidence. 'This is the single biggest obstacle that women face.' Ann Pickering, O2's HR director and board member, added: . 'Our research shows that, while the diversity debate has moved on outside of the office, not enough women are actually seeing this progress at work. 'If we're to achieve sustainable and long-lasting change, we can't just look at women already at the top - we need to focus our efforts on women at every level, creating a strong pipeline of female talent across British businesses.'","A third of women said they aspired to be the CEO or on the board of a company.

75394,"It suggests the selectors still have an eye on that number six spot because while Jonny Bairstow is favourite to start in the first Test in Brisbane on 21 November, he is yet to find that big score which will nail down his spot in the batting order.
Ballance deserves his call, he is clearly a good player. He averages more than 50 in first-class cricket and scored a hundred for the Lions against Australia this summer.
31 Oct -2 Nov v Western Australia XI, Perth
6-9 Nov v Australia A, Hobart
13-16 Nov v New South Wales XI, Sydney
21-25 Nov 1st Test, Brisbane
29-30 Nov v Chairman's XI, Alice Springs
5-9 Dec 2nd Test, Adelaide
13-17 Dec 3rd Test. Perth
26-30 Dec 4th Test, Melbourne
3-7 Jan 2014 5th Test, Sydney
Performing well for the Lions is one route into this England team, with another being consistent performances in county cricket over a long period.
Michael Carberry was probably competing with Somerset's Nick Compton as cover for skipper Alastair Cook and Joe Root, but he has been given the nod - and much of that will be down to his sterling service in the domestic game for Hampshire.
However, a lot of people have sympathy for Compton because he has not done very much wrong. He will rightly feel disappointed not to be on that plane to Australia.
Meanwhile, England have clearly gone for the big, tall fast bowlers in their touring squad. We're expecting quick, bouncy pitches and quite a hostile series with  some rancour and ill-feeling carried over from the summer.
Boyd Rankin showed what he could do in his one-day performances against Australia at the end of this summer, and I think he's probably ahead of Steven Finn and Chris Tremlett in the pecking order at the moment.
Finn has had a disappointing summer and some people might consider Tremlett fortunate to be there, so Rankin has a great chance of playing in the first Test match.
England are hoping Tremlett can rediscover his venom from the last tour to Australia when he came in and bowled with a lot of pace.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Has Tremlett still got it? I didn't see him bowl for Surrey towards the end of the season but I did hear some pretty mixed reviews.
It's nice to see Ben Stokes getting a chance because he is going to be a good cricketer. He bats genuinely and has a bit of pace with the ball - more than Chris Woakes, who has not been picked after making his debut in the final Test of this summer's series.
Perhaps the biggest decision was whether to take Monty Panesar as the second spinner. Are England going to be able to manage him and help him following his off-field problems? This is not just an issue from last summer, there have been issues in the background for a little while now.
It's an opportunity for Monty to get himself back on the straight and narrow, and for England to help him do it.
I think Lancashire's Simon Kerrigan played in that fifth Test at The Oval because they didn't want to select Monty. Poor old Kerrigan then had a nightmare but at least he is in the performance squad this winter.
England do have three warm-up games before the first Test so it will be interesting to monitor the Bairstow and Ballance situation. Ballance might get one, a maximum of two, opportunities and if he gets runs and Bairstow doesn't, that will make things interesting for the selectors before the first Test.
Similarly with the fast bowlers - if Finn starts well, you imagine he will be that third seamer. If he doesn't, you can see Rankin getting a chance to make his Test debut.
It's going to be an aggressive series so England want to go in with their big guns firing.

44713,"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Reuters . PUBLISHED: . 01:55 EST, 19 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 08:22 EST, 19 February 2014 . Georgia lawmakers on Tuesday voted to allow bars and churches to decide for themselves whether to let gun owners carry weapons into their buildings. The measure heads for the state Senate after the members of Georgia's House of Representatives approved the legislation with a 119-56 vote, according to the chamber's Twitter account. The rights of gun owners became a major political issue in 2012, when the United States experienced a rash of mass shootings, including a massacre that claimed the lives of 20 first-graders and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut. Lock and load: With state Senate approval, Georgia will become one of several states that allows guns in bars . Gun-control and gun-rights advocates have turned their respective efforts to statehouses after gun control legislation stalled in the U.S. Congress. Under the Georgia bill, churches and bars would be allowed to decide whether to allow weapons inside their buildings, according to the legislation's sponsor, Rep. Rick Jasperse, a Republican. 'We don't need to be penalizing law-abiding citizens and taking away their Second Amendment rights,' Jasperse said, referring to the U.S. Constitution's right to bear arms. The legislation would also allow secondary schools to decide whether to allow teachers and administrators to carry weapons. Sponsor: The bill's sponsor, Rick Jasperse, says people have a Constitutional right to bring guns into bars . Georgia is one of several states either considering - or that already - allowing guns in bars. The first state that voted to allow guns bars was Tennessee in 2009, followed by Arizona, also in 2009. In Arizona, bar owners have the right to not allow guns into their businesses, but they are required to put a government-issued sign in the window explaining that guns are not allowed. Twenty states' laws don't address the issue of guns in bars, which conceivably means people can carry guns in bars if they have the proper permits. Arizona: In Arizona, bar owners who don't want guns in their businesses are forced to put a government-issued sign in the window . 'The legislation does not represent the majority of people of Georgia, but only a small number of gun advocates,' said Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver, a Democrat who voted against the bill. If the bill passes, gun owners will also be able to take their weapons into governmental buildings if security screenings are not in place, but guns would remain prohibited in courthouses and prisons.","Georgia lawmakers approved the legislation with a 119-56 vote.

The blast occurred shortly after 9 a.m. (3 a.m. ET) outside the building of a construction company, CNN partner network CNN+ reported. The company, Ferrovial Agroman, is involved in building a high-speed train line in the Basque region, which ETA opposes. The attack came just hours after Spain's Supreme Court declined to allow two new leftist Basque parties to compete in the March 1 Basque regional elections in northern Spain. Authorities allege the new parties are simply new names for other leftist Basque parties already outlawed for their links to ETA. ""What ETA did this morning ratifies the Supreme Court decision last night,"" Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told reporters, at the scene of the explosion. At least 30 vehicles parked in the street were damaged, as well as the construction company offices, the Spanish police said in a statement. The bomb, it added, was placed in a van stolen last night in the Madrid area. Exactly four years ago, on Feb. 9, 2005, ETA placed a bomb in the same Madrid neighborhood that was hit on Monday.

The brick-built former coach house, used for years to park the Mayor of Southwark’s car, sold at auction for almost triple the guide price and £150,000 more than the average house in Camberwell. The price paid for the 'empty shell' of a building by an anonymous buyer beat the previous record, held by a garage near Harrods in Knightsbridge, west London, by £25,000. A ramshackle garage next to a south London industrial estate has become the most expensive ever to sell in Britain after going under the hammer for £550,000 in a 'frenzied' bidding war . The brick-built former coach house, used for years to park the Mayor of Southwark's car, sold at auction for almost triple the guide price . The coach house is next to Vanguard Court, a thriving hub of 40 small workshops and studios off Peckham Road, whose tenants have included ceramicist Edmund de Waal and Turner Prize short-listed sculptor Cathy de Monchaux. The 568sq ft double height brick building, which has vaulted ceilings, a roller steel door and a cobbled drive, was given an estimate of £200,000 by auctioneers Andrew Scott Robertson. Associate director and auctioneer Jeremy Lamb, who supervised the sale, said he was 'surprised' the building, which was previously owned by Southwark Council, had fetched so much. He said: 'It’s an empty shell of a building. The coach house is next to Vanguard Court, a thriving hub of 40 small workshops and studios off Peckham Road, whose tenants have included ceramicist Edmund de Waal and Turner Prize short-listed sculptor Cathy de Monchaux . The 568sq ft double height brick building, which has vaulted ceilings, a roller steel door and a cobbled drive, was given an estimate of £200,000 by auctioneers Andrew Scott Robertson . 'It’s in a reasonable state, but there are quite a few cracks in the walls. 'We had about six or seven bidders at the auction - a mixture of residential developers, investors, potential occupiers and artists. However, the number of bidders quickly dropped as the price went up.' Mr Lamb put down the high price to London’s housing crisis - with demand for properties far outstripping supply. He said: 'Free-hold properties of this type are very scarce, and there is a high demand for properties like this in the area. The marker 'A' shows where the garage is situated in south London's Camberwell . A view from the road which shows the entrance to the garage in south London . 'A terraced house here sells for between £500,000 and £600,000 and the coach house, subject to planning permission, would make a good home.' He added any buyer wishing to turn it into a house, could expect to invest £100,000 in it. More than 200 artists and small business owners working in the court signed a petition opposing Southwark Council’s sale of the building on the grounds any new owners would object to the noise created by the 'busy and thriving' light industrial estate. The buyer is anonymous but there have been rumours it has been bought by one of the artists in order to save the studios. The coach house sold for £150,000 more than the average house in Camberwell, pictured (file photo) Mr Lamb added: 'The coach house would make an ideal artist’s studio and I’ve heard rumours it has been bought by a wealthy artist to save it from being turned into housing, though I haven’t a clue if that is true.' Cllr Richard Livingstone, Southwark’s Cabinet Member for Finance and Resources, added: 'Like most councils, Southwark has experienced big cuts to our budgets in recent years, and we need to ensure we are making the most of all viable opportunities available to us to generate income. 'We are therefore delighted to have sold this garage for such a good price, having already made savings from no longer running the Mayoral car it housed. 'The proceeds will help the council to invest in our capital programme which pays for improvements to libraries, parks and facilities for older people, for example, allowing us to continue delivering excellent services for all our residents.' The Camberwell garage is not the only London lock-ups with a hefty asking price. Many tiny spaces in the capital have sold for a small fortune with buyers keen to take advantage of their investment potential. In 2010 a dilapidated row of storage units in Primrose Hill went on the market with a whopping £1.25million asking price. But the new owner could rest assured that they would own property in the same trendy area as Kate Moss. In 2012 a 6-metre long garage went on the market for £525,000, but that was because of its pricey postcode in Knightsbridge - home to Harrods and some of the world's richest people. In October 2013 a double garage sold in Highgate sold for a cool £251,000. For the money the new owner can enjoy mains electricity in each of the two garages, and there is an option of connecting to water on-site. And in August 2013 a 224sqft Highgate lock-up, which had been converted into a studio flat went on the market for £250,000.","Brick-built former coach house sold at auction for almost triple the guide price.

The father of missing Utah woman Susan Powell has ignited a custody battle with his son-in-law for the couple's two children. The boys, ages four and six, had been living at their paternal grandfather's home with their father, Josh Powell - the only named person of interest in his wife's 2009 disappearance. No charges have been filed against him. Chuck Cox set off the custody battle on Friday, after the boys were placed in foster care following the arrest of Josh Powell's father, Steven Powell, on child porn and voyeurism charges. Court battle: Susan Powell's father, Chuck Cox, filed for custody of her kids on Friday . Charged: Steven Powell, the father-in-law of missing Utah woman Susan Powell, appears in Pierce County courtroom on Friday in Tacoma, Washington . Steven Powell, 61, was arrested after . police investigating Susan Powell's disappearance came across thousands . of images of women videotaped without their knowledge, including some of . his daughter-in-law. Wearing an orange jailhouse jumpsuit . and with his hands cuffed he entered not guilty pleas in court in . Washington state on Friday, and the judge set bail at $200,000. The judge at Powell's arraignment ordered him not to have contact with his grandsons. A lawyer for the state attorney general said the boys had been placed in foster care since the arrest. A court commissioner said on Friday . that he will not decide on the custody of the sons until after the . state's child welfare agency finishes its investigation. Another hearing . is scheduled for Wednesday. Chuck Cox said after the hearing: 'We're very concerned for the welfare of our grandchildren. We're doing everything we can.' Accused: Steven Powell, 61, was arrested last night at his Washington home on child porn and voyeurism charges after thousands of images were found . Missing: Susan Powell, 28 and a mother of two, has not been seen since 2009. Her arrested father-in-law Steven said he had a 'sexual relationship' with her . Handcuffed: Steven Powell is led away by a police officer following his arrest in Washingon last night . The arrest - and the child custody . motion - are the latest twists in a case that has perplexed Utah police, . who are on their 12th day of searching a remote stretch of desert near . where Josh Powell says he went camping the night his wife vanished. Prosecutor Mark Lindquist in . Washington state said Steven Powell is charged with 14 felony counts of . voyeurism and one count of possession of child pornography. Lindquist said Utah police . investigating Susan Powell's disappearance found 'thousands of images of . females being videotaped without their knowledge, including Susan . Powell,' on tapes and disks at his home in an August 25 search. The videos were found in Steven . Powell's bedroom. Lindquist said in a statement: 'The photographer . focuses on the women's buttocks, breasts. Many images were of minor . females.' The images included shots of two girls . who were as young as eight and ten years old at the time, the . prosecutor said. Authorities determined that the girls lived near Steven . Powell from June 2006 to August 2007. Raised eyebrows: Steven Powell went on record last month to say Susan was promiscuous and used to make him smell her hair . At Powell's arraignment, prosecutor . Grant Blinn said detectives are still going through the seized items, . but so far have found more than 1,000 video files. He said it appeared . he had been secretly videotaping girls or women for at least ten years. The arrest prompted a Cox family . lawyer to directly accuse Josh - for the first time publicly - of . involvement in his wife's disappearance. 'The time has come where we have to . stop playing cat and mouse games: Josh Powell had something to do with . the disappearance of the mother of these children,' attorney Steve . Downing told the court commissioner on Friday. Powell responded: 'Everything they said is patently false. I am a good father to my sons.' Before the hearing, he sat in the back . row of the small courtroom wearing a blue jacket, jeans, white sneakers . with the treads worn off - and his wedding ring. Husband: Josh Powell, Susan's husband and Steven's son, is still the only person of interest in his wife's missing persons case . Two years: Susan Powell was reported missing from her Utah home on December 7, 2009 . Search: Investigators found a shallow grave while searching a site in the desert earlier this month . Powell flipped through a thick stack . of legal documents and told a reporter 'no' when asked if he had . anything to say about his dad's arrest. He ignored several other . questions. Susan Powell's father called the . allegations against Steven Powell disgusting. 'It very clearly shows her . concerns were just about Steven Powell,' Chuck Cox said. In a statement issued late Wednesday, . West Valley City, Utah police, who are investigating Susan Powell's . disappearance, said Steven Powell's arrest was not related to the . missing person case. They have said Josh Powell has been uncooperative in their investigation. Josh Powell claims he took the . couple's two sons - then ages four and two - on a midnight camping trip . in the mountains west of Salt Lake City on December 6, 2009, the night . before she was reported missing. Also Friday, a Washington state judge . issued a permanent injunction barring Josh Powell and his father from . further publishing journal pages Susan Powell wrote as a teenager. The Powells claimed the journal . entries depicted a troubled woman, but Susan's family has been fighting . their release, saying they were the personal writings of a young girl . and had no bearing on her disappearance. Authorities planned to wrap up their . 12-day search of the desert Friday about 30 miles from where Josh Powell . said he went camping that night. At one point, they said they found a . 'shallow grave' after cadaver dogs alerted them to the spot. But they found no human remains. Charred wood chips discovered in the hole have been sent to a lab for testing. The search of the Powells home in . Puyallup, Washington, last month came after police wrapped up a search . for evidence in a network of abandoned mines outside Ely, Nevada. Around that time in August, Josh . Powell and his father went on national television to discuss the case. They claimed Susan Powell was promiscuous, emotionally unstable and . suicidal, a claim her family denies. Steven Powell said he had a flirtatious relationship with his daughter-in-law and believed they were in love. 'Susan was very sexual with me,' Steve . Powell told ABC's Good Morning America. 'We interacted in a lot of . sexual ways because Susan enjoys doing that.' Cox, Susan's father, denied the allegations, and said it was Steven Powell who initiated unwanted sexual advances. Josh Powell has denied killing his . wife or having anything to do with her disappearance. 'I would never . even hurt her,' a tearful, red-eyed Josh Powell told CBS' Early Show in . August. Josh and his father have said they believe Susan Powell ran off with another man. 'I'm still thinking she left,' Steven . Powell told The Associated Press in August. 'Hopefully they'll be able . to find her at some point...

67985,"Peter Robinson thinks such a voluntary scheme would save £160m a year.
The first minister told a DUP event on Thursday that he expected ""you would be knocked over in the rush"" if such a scheme opened.
Sinn Féin has not disagreed that such a scheme is on the cards. The executive agreed a loan of up to £100m from the Treasury on Thursday.
Finance Minister Simon Hamilton said the executive still faced an ""incredibly difficult budget situation"" that was exacerbated by the executive's failure to reach a deal on welfare reform.
""The entire executive recognises that we're facing immense challenges moving forward,"" he said.
""At our meeting on Wednesday, there was agreement across all of the parties that the head of the civil service would go away and produce a report and a plan for the executive to consider that would look at the restructuring of our whole public sector.
""That will look at issues around the number of civil servants and public servants that we have, issues around pay as well and we will consider that in the light of what the head of the civil service brings back to us.""
Analysis: BBC News NI Economics & Business Editor John Campbell
On the most recent figures, for June 2014,  there are 212,000 employees in the Northern Ireland public sector.
About 74,000 of those work in the health service and another 65,000 work in education.
The numbers have been coming down over the past five years - in June 2009 the total was 226,000.
In the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) for example, numbers have decreased from 11,000 to fewer than 10,000.
But there have been steeper falls in other parts of the UK.
A paper circulating at Stormont examines the change in public sector employment between 2010 and 2013.
It shows a fall of less than 4% in Northern Ireland, compared to a drop of almost 8% in Scotland and more than 10% in England.
Education Minister John O'Dowd said his party would await the outcome of those discussions.
""We will wait on the report from the head of the civil service after the discussions with the union, but the key word is voluntary,"" he said.
""At this stage no-one is envisaging that there will be forced redundancies upon anyone.
""There has not been a voluntary redundancy scheme within the civil service for many, many years and there is a suggestion that if a voluntary redundancy scheme came forward that it would be quite popular and that it would attract the numbers that would be required to reduce costs across the public service.
""We will take a look at the terms and conditions of (any) voluntary redundancy scheme and if we're satisfied with it, we will support a voluntary redundancy scheme after all those measures have taken place.""
The number of public sector jobs in Northern Ireland has been falling slowly but now it looks like the pace will pick up.
The deal to secure the loan of up to £100m from the Treasury was brokered by the Democratic Unionist Party with the Chancellor, George Obsborne.
It means extra cash for departments, including £60m for the Department of Health and almost £30m for the Department of Justice.
However, the arrangement has been criticised by other parties as an ""expensive sticking plaster"".
The Treasury had been asked to supply Stormont with a one-off loan of between £100m and £150m to ease its budgetary crisis.
It is understood that Peter Robinson and Finance Minister Simon Hamilton made the proposal to the chancellor.
Mr Robinson said the loan was conditional on Stormont agreeing a draft budget for 2015/16 by the end of October.
The loan will ensure Stormont does not breach its spending limits by more than £200m at the end of the financial year.
However, it will increase the amount Stormont will owe the Treasury next year.
Northern Ireland's failure to implement welfare reform means the executive will incur £87m in penalties this year and another £114m next year - those penalties might be waived if the parties reach a deal in the near future.
It is also understood that welfare reform is not part of the deal with the Treasury, but instead will feature in the planned political talks due to begin next week.",The first minister has said a voluntary redundancy scheme would be popular and save the public service money.
5569,"""I loved Spock,"" said Mr Obama.
Nimoy died in Los Angeles on Friday.  His son Adam said he died of end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is often caused by smoking.
His career took in acting, directing, writing and photography, but he was best known for portraying the half-human, half-Vulcan character Spock.
Obama said in a statement: ""Long before being nerdy was cool, there was Leonard Nimoy.
""Leonard was a lifelong lover of the arts and humanities, a supporter of the sciences, generous with his time and talents.
""And of course, Leonard was Spock. Cool, logical, big-eared and level-headed, the centre of Star Trek's optimistic, inclusive vision of humanity's future.""
Obama's approach to politics has been described as Spock-like. He greeted Nimoy with a four fingered Vulcan salute when the pair met in 2007.
Among the torrent of tributes on Twitter was a message from Nasa crediting Nimoy and Star Trek as an inspiration.
Other Star Trek cast members gave their praise too. William Shatner, who as Captain Kirk acted alongside Nimoy for years in Star Trek, said he loved the actor ""like a brother"".
George Takei, who played Hikaru Sulu said ""he was an extraordinarily talented man but he was also a very decent human being.""
Zachary Quinto, who played Spock in a Star Trek prequel, said: ""My heart is broken.""
Nimoy played the Spock in all three of the original series of the programme and later in several big-screen spin offs.
He did have success outside of his Spock costume, in both acting and directing, and he pursued music, painting, and photography.
After the end of Star Trek's initial run, he played master of disguise Paris in the hit adventure series Mission Impossible.
Later he directed two of the Star Trek films, The Search for Spock and The Voyage Home, and in 1987 helmed the hit comedy Three Men and a Baby, one of the highest-grossing films of that year.

30900,"After all the effort of getting a university place, the Higher Education Policy Institute study suggests, there can be unrealistic expectations.
Most young people expect to have more teaching hours in university than in school, when the opposite is the case.
The study also found that young people with a mental health problem were unlikely to have told their university.
There have been many surveys of student attitudes - but this is unusual in looking at the expectations of young people about to become students.
The study, carried out by the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) and Unite Students, suggests that as well as being excited and nervous, many students are deeply ill-informed about what to expect.
About half a million new students begin university courses in the UK each year - and an annual Hepi study published earlier this year suggested that only about a third thought they were getting good value for money.
The latest study, based on a sample of more than 2,000 young people, suggests this could be because expectations of university life are unlikely to be matched by the reality.
In terms of ""contact hours"", 66% of the young people surveyed thought university would mean more group work than in school and 60% thought there would be more lecture hours than classroom hours in school.
But in practice, teaching hours at A-level or equivalent will probably be much higher than at university - with students on degree courses such as history often having fewer than 10 hours per week.
There has been much concern about mental health problems among students - but this study suggests that universities might not be informed about pre-existing conditions or concerns.
Only about a third of the would-be students with a mental health condition intended to disclose it to the university they were planning to attend.
There has also been debate about whether students' parents should be informed of their adult children's mental health problems at university.
This study found that only about one in five of the would-be students thought that parents should not be told.
For many young people, this will be the first time that they will have lived away from home and shared with other people.
The survey found that those from poorer backgrounds were less prepared for meeting strangers and building a new social circle - and that these poorer would-be students were more likely to be planning to live at home.
There are also suggestions that young people are not clear about the costs ahead of them.
Aside from tuition fees, accommodation is likely to be the biggest cost for students living away from home.
But when asked about their finances, only about half of the would-be students identified rent as the biggest expense.
Others thought that their biggest spending would be on ""course materials"", ""nights out"", ""groceries"" or ""student societies"".
Nick Hillman, Hepi's director, said that this suggested more should be done to help in the transition between school and university.
""We know lots about what students think but very little about what those applying to higher education expect to happen when they get there,"" said Mr Hillman.
""We set out to fix this gap because people who expect a different student experience to the one they get are less satisfied, learn less and say they are getting less good value for money.
""Most applicants expect to spend more time in lectures than they do in school lessons, but few university students actually do this.
""Almost three-quarters of them expect their future university to contact their families if they face mental health issues, but this is a legal minefield so typically does not happen.
""Schools, parents and universities - not to mention policymakers - all need to help school-leavers get real about their expectations.""
Universities Minister Jo Johnson said: ""People will have different expectations of a university education, but what is indisputable is the expectation for excellent teaching and a good return on their investment.""","Many young people are nervous and excited about the prospect of a university place, but many are not sure what to expect, a new study suggests."

67689,"Separate federal indictments claim that supporters of the Islamic extremist group Al-Shabaab have funneled money for brutal terrorist operations. In one case, two men were indicted in Missouri for allegedly funneling money to the Somali group, the Justice Department said Wednesday. The indictment said Mohamud Abdi Yusuf of St. Louis discussed Al-Shabaab in code language and used fictitious names and phone numbers to send money to the group's supporters through remitting businesses in the United States. Yusuf is also charged with conspiring with Abdi Mahdi Hussein, an employee of a licensed remittance company, to structure financial transactions so as to avoid any record. Hussein was also indicted and arrested for conspiracy on those transactions. A third man, Duwayne Mohamed Diriye, is accused of helping distribute that money to Al-Shabaab from inside Somalia and Kenya. He has also been charged but remains at large in east Africa. FBI special agents arrested Yusuf in St. Louis on Monday and Hussein on Tuesday in Minneapolis, Minnesota, according to the Justice Department. Both men appeared in federal court Tuesday. If convicted, Yusuf faces a maximum of 15 years in prison and/or fines of up to $250,000 for each count of providing material support to terrorists. Yusuf and Hussein could each be sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison and/or fines of up to $250,000 for conspiring to structure transactions. The indictments were made public a day after three men in San Diego, California, were similarly charged with providing support to the al Qaeda-linked group. Issa Doreh and Mohamed Mohamed Mohamud, clad in orange jumpsuits, pleaded not guilty at a federal hearing in San Diego on Wednesday. A third man named in the indictment, Basaaly Saeed Moalin, was arrested Tuesday but was not in court. The five-count indictment alleges conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, conspiracy to kill in a foreign country, money laundering and providing material support to terrorists. According to the indictment, the three provided thousands in funding for Al-Shabaab to purchase weapons, including rocket-propelled grenades and improvised explosive devices. Before his death in May 2008, Al-Shabaab militant leader Aden Hashi Ayrow had called ""for foreign fighters to join Al-Shabaab in a 'holy war' against the Ethiopian and other African forces in Somalia,"" the indictment states. The defendants, individually or together, funneled about $10,000 to Somalia, the indictment states, indicating that Ayrow told them, ""it is time to finance the jihad."" Each rocket-propelled grenade cost $270, an uncharged co-conspirator told them. A U.S. missile strike killed Ayrow. Dozens of supporters for the defendants, many in traditional Muslim garb, packed the small courtroom of U.S. Magistrate Judge William Gallo, who set a bail hearing for Friday morning. Assistant U.S. Attorney William Cole requested that the men be held without bail, alleging that they are flight risks and a danger to the community. Prosecutors would not discuss the nationalities of the defendants. Al-Shabaab has been waging a war against Somalia's government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or sharia. Somalia has not had a stable government since 1991, and fighting between the rebels and government troops has added to the impoverished east African nation's humanitarian crisis. Just last week, Al-Shabaab publicly executed two teenage girls after accusing them of being spies for the Somali government, the group said. ""Those two girls were evil, and they were spies for the enemy [the Somali government], but the mujahedeen caught them and after investigation, they admitted their crime, so they have been executed,"" said Sheikh Yusuf Ali Ugas, commander of Al-Shabaab in Beledweyne, a town in central Somalia. Al-Shabaab is one of almost 50 groups that have been designated by the State Department as foreign terrorist organizations. CNN's Casey Wian contributed to this report.","Indictment says Al-Shabaab supporters used fictitious names and phone numbers.

The video was taken in the parking lot of the North Attleboro, Massachusetts, police station on June 18, 2013, the day after Odin Lloyd was killed.

Former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez, left, looks back as he sits with his attorney Charles Rankin during his murder trial on Friday . Hernandez stares straight ahead as a photo of a small handgun found in a wooded area near the crime scene was displayed during his murder trial on Friday . Prosecutors said Hernandez was seen using the phone and calling co-defendant Ernest Wallace. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh said Friday that the jury will not be told where the phone came from, just that it didn’t belong to Hernandez. On Wednesday, a second juror was dismissed in the murder trial of Hernandez. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh said she had dismissed a juror for personal reasons that have nothing to do with the case. That's the same explanation she gave to jurors last week when she dismissed another juror. The judge said that juror had discussed evidence in the case. That female juror allegedly discussed the case outside the courtroom and attended more Patriots games than she told the court. Garsh started Wednesday's session by saying she received a note from a juror about an issue. The lawyers, Hernandez and then the juror were brought in to discuss the issue with the judge - though it's not clear what they talked about. When the judge ordered the jury back into the court room, there were 16 jurors left - the one who was questioned was among them. Murder victim Odin Lloyd's fiancée Shaneah Jenkins is pictured in court on Friday, sitting with Odin's mother (far right) and relatives . Garsh did not give more details Wednesday. She ended the session for the day after about two hours, citing unspecified scheduling issues. The panel is now made up of 10 women and six men. Twelve will ultimately decide Hernandez's fate. Alternates will be selected randomly immediately before deliberations. Hernandez is accused of the June 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating his fiancée's sister. Yesterday, Hernandez's 25-year-old fiancée  Shayanna Jenkins was granted immunity in the trial - a move likely made so that prosecutors can call her to testify. The grant of immunity may mean that the football player's girlfriend will not be able to invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if she takes the witness stand. Prosecutors have said Jenkins lied to a grand jury dozens of times including when she said she didn't know what she did with a box she took from the basement of their home. They say it contained possible evidence leading to Mr Lloyd's killer. Jenkins has pleaded not guilty to perjury. Jenkins still lives in Hernandez's North Attleborough mansion with their 2-year-old daughter.","The judge overseeing the murder trial of Aaron Hernandez denied a request by his defense on Friday to bar police surveillance video.

Forget about warming comfort food and step away from the office biscuit tin. For those looking to wow colleagues - and the office crush - at this year’s Christmas party, the diet needs to start today. With 62 per cent of women admitting in a new survey that they plan to slim down for the festive season, today has been earmarked as the time to start in order to safely drop a dress size. Over half (52 per cent) the women polled admitted to wanting to lose at least 9lbs before they slip into their party dresses (the equivalent of a full dress size). Just 10 per cent admitted they were completely happy with their current shape and size. And it seems it is the workplace where we most want to impress. Some 40 per cent of women revealed they . specifically want to drop the pounds ahead of their work Christmas party . to feel confident in front of their colleagues. But yearly summer and pre-Christmas slim downs can be dangerous, not only to our health if weight is dropped too fast, but also to our wallets. Growing in and out of clothes is one of the UK’s biggest fashion complaints costing the average women up to £500 a year, with 59 per cent of women admitting their weight fluctuates anywhere between 4-10lbs every year. Fad diets, New Year resolutions and special occasions - namely Christmas, weddings and holidays - were given as the main reasons for these weight fluctuations. One in five women now claims to own up 15 party dresses, with the Little Black Dress polled as the favourite festive frock choice for 73 per cent of women, who admitted to owning at least ten LBDs at any one time. Almost a third of women also admitted to holding onto up to five dresses that are too small for them, in the hope of one day getting into them once again.

14721,"The former Europe minister - who backs Britain's membership - said the British people had to have their say.
He said he was ""disappointed"" Ed Miliband had not mentioned Europe in his big speech on Tuesday.
Mr Miliband has not ruled out a referendum but has said now is not the right time for it.
But Mr Vaz argued at the Fabian Society Fringe meeting in Brighton that this position was not sustainable, with the Conservatives promising a referendum in 2017 and a general election approaching.
""The party cannot duck this decision. I believe very passionately that we should have an in/out referendum and this should happen as quickly as possible,"" said Mr Vaz.
""It is not just about UKIP it's that the British people are as interested and concerned about Europe, as they are about the economy, as they are about immigration.
""And this cannot remain a Westminster village story.
""We have to trust the British people. They want the chance to have a say and we should give them the chance to have a say.""
He praised Mr Miliband's conference speech as ""one of the best"" he had heard from a Labour leader, but he was still ""disappointed"" there had been no mention of Europe - and no opportunity to discuss the issue at conference.
""There hasn't been a debate, there isn't going to be any debate, on Europe. There was a speech by Glenys (Kinnock) but no real debate on these issues. I think that's a mistake.
""If we don't debate these issues, others will. So let's have a referendum, lets have it as quickly as possible and let's put our case to the British people.""
The chairman of the home affairs select committee attacked the party leadership's current stance on the referendum issue, saying: ""We simply cannot go to the British people and say to them support the European Union, we are going to reform it in the future. We have to set our stall now.""
He also poured scorn on David Cameron's promise to bring powers back from Brussels before holding a referendum, predicting it would not happen.
He said that if the prime minister was re-elected in 2015 he would not have the time to hold bilateral meetings with 27 EU nations and those countries would not want to ""indulge"" Britain by taking part in ""fake renegotiations"".
YouGov polling guru Peter Kellner warned ""people around"" Ed Miliband, who were contemplating a referendum pledge, that it would be a foolish move.
If Labour won the next election the vote would be held in mid-term, with what would probably be a Eurosceptic Tory leader, he argued, and that meant there was a good chance Britain would ""end up leaving"" the EU, something Mr Miliband did not want and would not be good for Britain.
He told the meeting the policy had been dreamed up by the Conservatives because they were ""scared"" of UKIP.
Labour MP Mike Gapes also made the case against a referendum, saying that if people wanted out of the EU they could vote UKIP and Labour's job was to make a ""positive"" case for Britain's continued membership.
But Lord Glasman, an academic whose ""Blue Labour"" philosophy was a key early influence on Ed Miliband's leadership, said a referendum was needed as it could lead to the return of ""democratic self-government"" in the UK.
Former Labour minister Graham Stringer also argued the case for a referendum, on the grounds EU powers had greatly expanded since the 1975 referendum.",UKIP leader Alastair Vaz has urged the Conservatives to hold a referendum on the EU as soon as possible.

54475,"New Order reinvented their back catalogue on the first night of the Manchester International Festival.
They played the first of five concerts with a 12-strong synthesiser ensemble.
Meanwhile, the thrillingly anarchic 14-strong hip-hop crew Levelz showed why they're being talked up as part of the next wave of Manchester heroes.
Together, they showed off different sides of the city's scene to open the biennial city-wide festival.
New Order took over one of the old Granada TV studios and pushed their status as synth-pop idols to the extreme by recruiting a dozen synthesiser players from the Royal Northern College of Music.
Those synth players were installed behind the regular band members in booths in a double-decker structure created by artist Liam Gillick.
Each booth was fronted by Venetian blind-style slats that opened and closed in formation as visuals were projected onto them.
The gig was largely a hit-free zone, with the group preferring to delve into rarities from their 40 years as Joy Division and then New Order rather than play their best-known tracks Regret, True Faith and Blue Monday.
They did revisit singles like Shellshock, Subculture and Bizarre Love Triangle. But otherwise they mostly picked album tracks, many of which they haven't performed live for years.
They included a couple of Joy Division songs - Disorder, the opening track from their 1979 debut album Unknown Pleasures, and Decades, the final track from their second album Closer.
Their back catalogue is deep enough, and fan loyalty is strong enough, for the crowd to be more than willing to go on this trip through their history.
However, singer Bernard Sumner did have to tell one fan it wasn't ""that kind of gig"" in response to an early shouted request.
Across town, Levelz were representing a different side of the city's scene to a smaller but no less ecstatic crowd at Gorilla.
They combine English grime-pop with the bounce and groove of West Coast hip-hop, heightened by the energy that comes from so many members spurring each other on and vying to be heard.
It all meant there was a melee of MCs jostling for space on the small square stage and taking turns or joining voices while a couple of their number supplied the booming, trembling bass from behind the decks.
That's not the end of their talents though. Speaking to BBC 6 Music earlier in the day, they said: ""We've got all sorts in the crew. We've got producers, DJs, actors, we've got people that draw, we've got a seamstress.
""Anything we want to do we can do and no one's going to say anything.""
Their energy didn't fade even after the power was cut to their equipment and the house lights were turned up when the curfew passed.
With some fans climbing on stage to make it even more chaotic, the band led the crowd in singing an a capella encore - the Home and Away theme tune.

579,"By . Neil Sears . PUBLISHED: . 08:21 EST, 30 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:46 EST, 30 August 2013 . After problems with travellers trying to set themselves up in a public park over the summer, a council took the step of locking the main gates to keep them out. But, as a fresh convoy of 30 caravans arrived, such common sense was clearly no match for the warped logic of health and safety. Astonishingly, officials decided to unlock the vehicle access gate – because they were worried the intruders might hurt themselves during their efforts to get in. Open season: The gate which was erected to keep travellers out has now been opened amid health and safety fears . Setting up camp: Scores of caravans are now settled across Wild Park near Brighton . Advice: Police had warned the council that it was not safe for travellers to keep trying to access the site around the barrier . The travellers duly made themselves at . home – and because the council voluntarily let them in, police have . lost all powers to evict them. Taxpayers . will instead now have to fund a lengthy civil court battle to throw out . the intruders from Wild Park, on the outskirts of Brighton. The . farce emerged in a leaked confidential email by Brighton and Hove . Council to councillors. It said: ‘After the initial trespass was . reported, Sussex Police highlighted the dangerous nature with which the . group were accessing the field. ‘As . such a decision was taken to open the access gate to reduce the risk to . road users and to stop the occupants from crossing the pavement to . access the road.’ Local . residents say they are now unable to use the park, Brighton and Hove’s . largest local nature reserve, and fear it could become ‘a new Dale . Farm’, the illegal Essex camp of 1,000 travellers which cost millions of . pounds to break up. Delighted: Travellers have set up camp at Wild Park, Brighton, after being let into the site by council officials . Crazy: Critics have described the decision to open the gate and let travellers in as 'madness' At the . start of the summer, the council padlocked the gates to Wild Park after . itinerants had to be removed. About 30 caravans arrived and the . travellers, determined to gain access, repeatedly drove over pavements . and mounds designed as obstructions. It was then, last week, that the . Green Party-led council decided to open the gates to reduce risk to the . public and the travellers themselves. More than 30 caravans are now . camped on the land, with more feared over the weekend. Inspector . Bill Whitehead of Sussex Police said if the gates had remained locked, . any travellers could have been evicted immediately because they would . have been committing an offence under Section 61 of the Criminal Justice . and Public Order Act. But because the council had let them in, the . section no longer applies. Tory . councillor Dawn Barnett said last night: ‘The council is mad. They have . opened the flood gates. The kids who live nearby can’t play in the park . any more because it’s not safe. I am terrified it may turn into another .

20061,"The family of a married couple murdered by the delusional death row inmate Scott Panetti say they are 'devastated' his execution has been stayed. Minnie Ybarbo, the daughter of Joe and Amanda Alvarado who were gunned down by the 56-year-old schizophrenic in 1992, says she and her son Junior Herrera, were hoping for 'some kind of closure' and claim the murderer is not as 'crazy' as people believe. They were on their way to Huntsville in Texas on Wednesday to witness Panetti's execution, 19 years after he was put on death row. But around 100 miles before they reached the prison and with just hours to spare, representatives from the attorney general's office told them it would not be going ahead. Scroll down for videos . Devastated: Minnie Ybarbo, the daughter of Joe and Amanda Alvarado who were gunned down by death row inmate Panetti in 1992, says she and her son Junior Herrera, were looking for 'some kind of closure' Victims: Joe and Amanda Alvarado, the parents of the death row inmate's estranged wife Sonja, were shot and killed at their home in Fredericksburg, Texas, in 1992 . The family claimed that the execution should have happened long ago. The average stay for an inmate on Texas death row is 11 years before he is killed. The condemned killer was due to be put to death at 6pm (CST) on Wedneday. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia some 14 years before shooting dead his estranged wife Sonja Alvarado's parents in front of her and their three-year-old daughter in Fredericksburg, Texas, in 1992. At his 1995 capital murder trial, Panetti acted as his own attorney, testified as alternate personality 'Sarge' to describe the Alvarado slayings and tried to subpoena Jesus Christ, the pope and the late President John F. Kennedy. Panetti wore a purple cowboy outfit, including a big cowboy hat, and largely ignored a standby attorney the judge appointed to assist him. The judgement from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in Texas ordered that the execution be halted 'to allow us to fully consider the late arriving and complex legal questions'. Describing harrowing accounts of the slayings, Mrs Ybarbo told KENS 5: 'My sister said that my mom just looked in his eyes and looked at Scott, and she knew she was going to be next, and he shot her too. 'It was very devastating because I guess I was looking forward to just having some type of closure.' Mr Herrera, the victim's grandson, said: 'It (execution) should have happened long ago. Years ago, and to me he's just finding a way to use the system to his advantage. Halt: Panetti was scheduled to die by lethal injection on Wednesday but the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in Texas stopped it 'to allow us to fully consider the late arriving and complex legal questions' 'He's not as crazy as they think he is. He's not as insane as they say he is.' Even though Panetti's death was postponed, the pair believed he will still be executed, it is just a matter of when. State attorneys contended Panetti's condition 'has not markedly changed' and he should not be given a reprieve from lethal injection. No court has ruled Panetti mentally incompetent or insane. He had been hospitalized more than a dozen times for treatment in the decade before fatally shooting Joe and Amanda Alvarado at their home in the Texas Hill Country in 1992. Their daughter Sonja, who was married to Panetti, and her three-year-old daughter, Amanda Lea, had moved in with them and she obtained a court order to keep Panetti away. Ms Alvarado filed for divorce because of her husband's drinking and she said he was obsessed with the notion that the devil lived in their house. He buried furniture and nailed the curtains shut. Panetti was also having hallucinations that the devil lived in the walls of the house and began washing the walls, believing that they were running with blood. On the morning of September 8, 1992, Panetti armed himself with a rifle, a sawed-off shotgun and knives, dressed in camouflage clothing and broke into his estranged wife's parents' home in Fredericksburg, about 60 miles north of San Antonio. Booking photos: Following the slayings, Panetti left his estranged wife's parents house, dressed in a suit and handed himself in to police . Panetti had been hospitalized more than a dozen times for schizophrenia in the decade before he shot dead his wife's parents. He was allowed to act as his own lawyer at trial and characterized himself as a cowboy. Pictured, is one of the inmate's recent sketches . Both Joe and Amanda Alvarado were shot at close range in front of his wife and daughter, before Panetti allowed them to leave. He later changed into a suit and handed himself into the police. In a sworn affidavit in 1999, Ms Alvarado said that although she hated what her ex-husband did, he was a good man who suffered mental illness and should not be put to death. In 1986, the high court ruled states may not execute killers whose insanity means they can't understand why they're being put to death. In 2002, the justices prohibited the execution of the mentally impaired. Five years later, ruling on an appeal from Panetti, the court said mentally ill condemned prisoners could be put to death if they have a factual and rational understanding of why they're being punished. Panetti has insisted Satan is working through Texas prison officials to execute him to keep him from preaching the Gospel.","Minnie Ybarbo, daughter of Joe and Amanda Alvarado, says she and her son Junior Herrera were hoping for 'some kind of closure' Panetti shot dead his estranged wife and daughter at their home in Fredericksburg, Texas, in September 1992.

Researchers say these cases show the potential for ""distraction-related injury and death"" with the rise in popularity of games such as Pokemon Go.
Both patients were admitted to a trauma centre with serious injuries.
Researchers from the US state of Arizona said it was a challenge to know how to categorise the injuries, which they describe as ""augmented reality application related injuries"".
The two cases, reported in Oxford Medical Case Reports, are among the first of their kind to appear in a medical journal.
Although the report said these sorts of apps encouraged players to exercise, it also warned of a ""sinister side"" because they encouraged players to become distracted.
Co-author David Armstrong, professor of surgery at the University of Arizona, said: ""Our world is filled with digital distractions increasing at a near logarithmic rate - both in work and in play.
""What we have to figure out as a society and, frankly, as a species, is how to dose these distractions to help make our lives better and not shorter.""
He said the key was ""striking a happy balance between engagement, activity and distraction"".
The first case involved a 19-year-old man who rolled his truck, with three passengers on board, ending up underneath it. He had lacerations to his liver.
One of the passengers was found underneath one of the truck's wheels, which was on top of his chest. He had two wounds to his head.
The other two passengers blacked out but walked away unhurt.
In the second case, a 58-year-old woman collided with a telegraph pole to avoid hitting a distracted pedestrian in the road, and ended up with multiple pelvic fractures.

74466,"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:19 EST, 27 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:46 EST, 27 February 2014 . President Barack Obama has launched a new program to help African American and Latino boys with a personal speech during which he talked about the low points in his youth. 'I made bad choices. I got high, not . always thinking about the harm it could do. I didn't always take school . as seriously as I should have. I made excuses. Sometimes I sold myself . short,' Obama said in the East Room of the White House on Thursday. His comments about his teenage years came as he launched the program called 'My Brother's Keeper' which plans to strengthen efforts in creating more opportunities for young black and Latino men. Men of color: President Obama introduced a new program that will spend $200million over five years in an effort to help increase mentorship opportunities for young minorty Americans and strengthen family life . He said that the program aims to improve conditions that keep these young men impoverished and imprisoned in disproportionate numbers. Obama said these young men consistently do worse in society, with odds stacked against them. 'By almost every measure the group that's facing some of the most severe challenges in the 21st century in this country are boys and young men of color,' Obama said, ticking off statistics on fatherhood, literacy, crime and poverty. 'We assume this is an inevitable part of American life instead of the outrage that it is,' Obama said, to applause. He was not entirely pessimistic, noting that the fact that he was elected as a mark of improvement. 'My presence is a testament to that progress,' Obama said. Obama spoke while flanked by teenagers involved in the Becoming a Man program to help at-risk boys in his hometown of Chicago. He said he sees himself in them. Dodgy days: The President has spoken in the past about how he did drugs as a teenager, and saw that today's event was an appropriate time to bring it back up . Historic: The launch of the program is set to calm minority critics who have faulted the president for not doing enough while in office . Under Obama's initiative, businesses, foundations and community groups would coordinate their investments to come up with, or support, programs that keep youths in school and out of the criminal justice system, while improving their access to higher education. Several foundations pledged at least $200million over five years to promote that goal. Meanwhile, Obama signed a presidential memorandum creating a government-wide task force to evaluate the effectiveness of various approaches, so that federal and local governments, community groups and businesses will have best practices to follow in the future. Valerie Jarrett, a senior White House adviser, said Thursday marks the start of an effort that the president and first lady Michelle Obama plan to undertake 'for the rest of their lives.' 'That's a moral, social responsibility that they feel will transcend the time that he's president,' Jarrett said. Connecting: The President was introduced by Christian Champagne from Chicago, and the pair bonded over their mutual love of the hometown baseball team, the White Sox . Leadership: Like the other young men on the stage, Christian is a part of the Becoming A Man program which runs in Chicago that was used as a roadmap for the larger nationwide program launched today . Obama's pledge to take action came during his State of the Union address last month, when he warned that young, black men face ""especially tough odds to stay on track and reach their full potential.' Obama himself grew up in a single-parent household, and has said he and some members of his staff were challenged and tempted by the same societal ills plaguing younger generations of minority males. The White House listed a litany of facts showing the need for the effort: the unemployment rate for African-American men over the age of 20 was 12 per cent last month, compared with 5.4 per cent for white men. Hispanic men over the age of 20 faced an unemployment rate of 8.2 per cent. Special guests: Trayvon Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, were in the audience at Thursday's speech- the day after the second anniversary of Trayvon's death . Famous face: Former Los Angeles Laker Magic Johnson attended both the speech and a meeting about the initiative on Thursday . The U.S. Census Bureau showed a . poverty rate of 27.2 per cent in black households and 25.6 per cent for . Hispanic households in 2012, compared with 12.7 per cent in white and . 11.7 per cent in Asian households. The . phrase 'my brother's keeper' comes from the book of Genesis in the . Bible, where God asks Cain, the son of Adam and Eve, for the location of . his brother Abel, who Cain had killed. In . some versions, Cain replies: 'Am I my brother's keeper?' Obama has . quoted those Bible verses several times during his presidency, saying . Americans should look out for each other. Freed from the pressure of seeking re-election, Obama also has taken a more visible role on issues affecting minorities. The . president, who famously said â€” 'I'm not the president of black America. I'm the president of the United States of America' â€” has moved to . commute sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, hoping to combat . sentencing disparities that disproportionately imprison minorities. Mayors in (and out of) charge: Chicago Mayor and former Obama chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg attended the event on Thursday . Attorney General Eric Holder, this month encouraged states to repeal laws that permanently bar felons from voting even after they have served their sentences. And Obama identified personally with the issue last year when he declared, after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, that Trayvon Martin, the black teenager killed in an encounter with Zimmerman in Florida, 'could have been me 35 years ago.' Both Trayvon's parents and the parents of Jordan Dunn, who was killed by a white man who got into an altercation with him about the volume of his music, were in the audience at Mr Obama's event today. The White House has been strongly criticized by some civil rights leaders for not using the presidential bully pulpit to do enough to address generations of disadvantage borne by the African-American community. But things are changing, said NAACP Interim President Lorraine Miller, who along with other civil rights groups met with the president in the White House last week. In talks: President Barack Obama discusses the new program, called My Brother's Keeper, with senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and former Secretary of State Colin Powell among others .",The president launched a new program to help black and Latino young men in his hometown of Chicago.

1968,"By . Lynne Wallis . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 14 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:00 EST, 14 December 2013 . Tragedy: An inquest has been launched into the passing of Shayla Walmsley, 44, examining whether her death could have been caused by a malfunctioning insulin pump . The catchphrase ‘In better control .  .  .’ appears again and again on the Medtronic website. It  is the pharmaceutical company’s clever marketing strategy to promote their insulin pumps – medical devices often thought of as a foolproof alternative to the daily injections of lifesaving drugs needed by diabetics. Yet last week, an inquest was launched into the death in her  sleep of financial journalist Shayla Walmsley, 44, with the family’s legal team examining whether it could have been caused by a malfunctioning insulin pump. A year before, a 26-year-old woman, known only as Ffion as she wishes  to remain anonymous, claims to have suffered a massive overdose after her pump released a large amount of the drug insulin into her bloodstream. She spent two days on a life support machine and lay in an induced coma for a further two days, but has since recovered fully. In . May, a week after Shayla’s  body was found, the Medicine and Healthcare . Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) watchdog sent out a warning regarding . the device after the manufacturer discovered some to be faulty. Problems . identified included mechanical faults that could result in too much . insulin being released – a potentially life-threatening overdose – by . accident. Medtronic, . who make the MiniMed Paradigm pumps, one of the most popular brands – . models of which were used by both women – say their products were not at . fault in Ffion’s case. They tested her pump and found it to be fully . functional. Human error is a known cause of overdose with all methods of . taking insulin. The cause . of Shayla’s death is yet to be determined by the coroner. But lawyer . Mark Harvey, who is representing both the Walmsley family and Ffion, . says known problems may predate these incidents. On . April 2 this year, Medtronic sent an ‘urgent recall’ letter to all . Australian users of MiniMed Paradigm pumps, warning them that . malfunctions with the device might lead to overdose. In July, US regulators the Food and . Drug Administration (FDA) followed suit after Medtronic admitted similar . faults with the devices there. ‘Severe illness’ resulting  from . overdose was highlighted as a potential risk. Under investigation: Shayla was using a programmable insulin pump administering it continuously through a catheter into her body . Warnings . are usually triggered when doctors or, more rarely, patients report . back to manufacturers, or directly to the relevant regulators, that they . are having problems with a device. Harvey . is concerned by the delay in issuing a UK warning and the fact that it . was not an urgent recall as had happened in Australia a month before. ‘We are worried that British patients may still not be aware of serious . issues with these devices.’ People . with type 1 diabetes produce very little or no insulin of their own, . which is a problem because insulin controls the body’s absorption of . sugars, or glucose. This  leads to dangerously high levels in the blood. Synthetic insulin is taken to control this problem. Insulin pumps are portable devices, about the size of a pack of cards, which stay connected to the body and deliver insulin from a reservoir via a cannula (tube) placed under the skin. They are programmable, allowing the user to modify the amount of drug they receive at any given time, which could be while sleeping. There are currently about three million diabetics in Britain, with ten per cent of those diagnosed with the type 1 form. In type 2 diabetes, the most common form, the condition is often controllable – and even reversible – with diet and tablets. For those with type 1, injections of insulin are the only treatment option. Typically, one daily injection provides a slow-acting background level of insulin, with additional fast-acting doses given with a separate injection ‘pen’ before or after eating or drinking. Before: A traditional insulin pen . The major problem with the treatment is the risk of hypoglycaemia (very low blood-sugar levels) if too much of the drug is taken. Often called ‘a hypo’, typically patients experience shakes, sweating, hunger, palpitations and mood swings due  to not enough glucose being available for use by cells throughout  the body. This is unpleasant but can usually be corrected by consuming a high-sugar food, such as a glucose tablet, fruit juice or sweets. But if blood-sugar drops for a longer period or sharply, patients can lose consciousness. This is considered a medical emergency, as the condition can be fatal. Just a few too many units of insulin given at any one time can be enough to trigger an episode. Insulin pumps eliminate the need for multiple jabs and, according  to studies put forward by manufacturers, also reduce the likelihood of hypos. Children – who may forget or misjudge amounts to inject – as well  as those who are very active or lead erratic lives, meaning they miss meals, and those with extremely difficult-to-control diabetes are usually considered candidates for  a pump. According to diabetes.co.uk, six per cent of adults and 19 per cent  of children with type 1 diabetes  use one. However, they are not foolproof. The FDA has reported 17,000 cases of health problems linked to insulin pumps made by manufacturers including Medtronic, MiniMed, Roche and Johnson & Johnson, all of which distribute in the UK. In some cases human error is to blame, but just how many incidents are related to mechanical faults is unclear. Ffion suffered an overdose of insulin in May 2012 after her pump released insulin into her bloodstream while she slept. She suffered convulsions which woke her boyfriend, who called an ambulance. Ffion initially sent her pump back to Medtronic for analysis. They wrote to her in April this year claiming there were ‘no anomalies’ with the device. She says: ‘Essentially, this implied it was my fault, not theirs. It made me very, very angry. If I had been sleeping alone, I wouldn’t be here now.’ Harvey, a partner at Hugh James solicitors, adds: ‘Their letter to Ffion fails to flag up the known problems in other countries. It was only after our own investigations that these malfunctions came to light. It seems strange that they did not mention the Australian urgent recall that happened in the same month.’ A spokesman for Medtronic said: ‘Patient safety is our top priority. We are committed to ensuring  high-quality standards of manufactured products to support them in their daily diabetes management. ‘Every day hundreds of thousands of customers use the Paradigm system in order to seek better control in their diabetes management. ‘We have not been contacted by any investigating authority or had the opportunity to examine the insulin pump Ms Walmsley used. Due to this and to patient confidentiality, we are unable to comment on the circumstances that led to Ms Walmsley’s death.’ A spokesman for the MHRA  said: ‘Our priority is to ensure that patients have acceptably safe  medical devices and we take prompt action to address any safety or performance concerns.’ Shayla’s older brother Stephen Walmsley is not reassured. He says: ‘If Shayla’s death was caused by a failing pump, the manufacturers need to take them off the market  to ensure no other family ever  has to go through the pain and misery that we are suffering.’","Financial journalist Shayla Walmsley, 44, died in her sleep last week.

Policy Exchange also advocated limiting child benefit to four youngsters per household with scaled down weekly payments after the first. This could save as much as £1billion over the next Parliament, it said. Pensioners should have to opt in to receive the winter fuel payment, said Policy Exchange think-tank . The think-tank added that scrapping automatic entitlement to winter fuel payments – worth up to £300 annually – would save as much as £400million a year. The handout aims to help those unable to heat their home properly but goes to all recipients of the basic state pension. But, Policy Exchange said, just 10 per cent of pensioner households are in fuel poverty. An 'opt-in' system would make it easier for wealthy retirees to decline the benefit. Recipients of pension credit would continue to receive it automatically. Pensioners can cancel their winter fuel payment but few do so as awareness is low.

Steve Hughes, author of the report, said: 'Welfare policy has come a long way in the last five years, but it is still not fit for the 21st century. The system needs to be made simpler, more effective, fairer, more affordable, and should reward contribution. 'Presenting pensioners with a choice to receive their winter fuel payment could lead to hundreds of millions of pounds worth of savings, and is just one way to root out perceived unfairness. 'Other measures to make social security better suit the needs of the individual, that make spending more transparent, and take into account an individual's contributory record should be priorities for the next government.'",Pensioners should have to opt in to receive the winter fuel payment.

22232,"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 10:41 EST, 3 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:37 EST, 4 January 2013 . Two thieves have become the first people in Britain to be handed ASBOs banning them from metal detecting. Peter Cox and Darren West were given the unique punishment after they looted ancient coins from a Roman site belonging to English Heritage. The pair were caught by police who raided their homes and found a haul of coins from the Iron Age, Roman and mediaeval periods worth hundred of pounds. ASBO: Peter Cox, left, and Darren West, right, have been banned from using metal detectors . Ransack: A piece of land at Chester Farm in Northamptonshire which was dug up by the two thieves . Officers also discovered pottery, metal antiquities and maps of Chester Farm, the Roman settlement near Irchester in Northamptonshire which the thieves ransacked. Cox, 69, and 51-year-old West were arrested in the summer when they were seen illegally digging trenches on the land. When police searched their homes in towns near the historic site, they were able to match the tools they recovered to plaster casts of marks left in the soil. Experts from the British Museum helped to analyse and date the recovered items, which have not been officially valued, and link them to the site. Investigation: Police took casts of the marks made by Cox and West's tools at the historic site . Cox and West pleaded guilty to two counts of theft from a scheduled monument on December 19. They were each given 52-week suspended sentences and were ordered to pay £750 costs and £750 compensation. The thieves were also issued with ASBOs preventing them from using metal detecting equipment. The coins they discovered at the site are similar to the massive haul of 50,000 Iron Age items found in Jersey last year, the largest hoard of Celtic coins ever unearthed. Historic: Chester Farm was an important settlement throughout the Iron Age, Roman and mediaeval periods . Under the law of treasure trove, metal detectorists who find items of historic significance must report their discoveries to the authorities. An inquest is then held to determine if the items should be declared treasure, in which case they must be offered for sale to a museum so they can be preserved for the nation. The proceeds from the sale are then shared between the person who discovered the items and the owner of the land where they were found. Among the best-known items to have been declared treasure is the Staffordshire Hoard, a collection of 1,500 Anglo-Saxon items made from gold and other precious metals which was found in 2009. Chester Farm is best known as a Roman town, showing evidence of houses, a cemetery and even a temple to the local Romano-Celtic gods. It also contains remains of an earlier Iron Age settlement, and was later the site of a mediaeval village.

After the hearing, Mike Harlow, governance and legal director of English Heritage, said: 'The sentence sets an important watershed in the combat against illegal metal detecting and acknowledges its true impact on society. 'These are not people enjoying a hobby or professionals carrying out a careful study. They are thieves using metal detectors like a burglar uses a jemmy. 'The material they are stealing belongs to the landowner and the history they are stealing belongs to all of us. 'Once the artefacts are removed from the ground and sold, the valuable knowledge they contain is lost for ever.'

'It should serve as a warning to anyone else involved in this activity that it is a crime and if you are caught you face prosecution and a criminal record.'","Peter Cox, 69, and Darren West, 51, given suspended sentences.

80577,"Abdul Hakim Belhaj alleges that former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and MI6 were complicit in arranging his and his wife's rendition from China in 2004.
The High Court had ruled the case could not be heard in the UK courts because it could damage foreign relationships.
But appeal judges said the claims were so ""grave"" a court should hear them.
Mr Belhaj, now a politician in Libya, said: ""My wife and I are gratified by the judges' decision to give us our day in court,"" adding their alleged torture was ""as fresh and as painful for us as if it happened yesterday"".
His lawyer Sapna Malik said it was ""very significant step forward"" to the case being heard in England.
Mr Straw, who has previously denied being aware of the rendition, and the government, have been given leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.
The Foreign Office said it was considering whether to make an application. The case would not be heard until after any appeal.
Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent
This judgement is a major blow for the government. The three judges have demanded that a light be shone into dark corners of the state's work - and not for the first time. Time and again the Court of Appeal has said allegations of wrongdoing, linked to security and intelligence, must be examined if the rule of law is to be upheld.
The key factors in this decision are clear: The judges say that international law and practice demands that alleged human rights abuses be examined. They say that it becomes even more important to do so given that claims are made against serving or former British officials.
Another reason they give is that unless an English court looks at the claims, the truth may never come out - and that is a denial of justice for both sides.
And most embarrassingly for ministers - they brush aside claims that allowing Mr Belhaj to sue would damage international relations.
Rendition involves sending a person from one country to another for imprisonment and interrogation, possibly by methods such as torture, that would be illegal in the country doing the rendering.
Mr Belhaj, former leader of an Islamist group which fought the regime of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, claims British intelligence provided information that facilitated his rendition, along with his pregnant wife Fatima Boudchar.
Last year, Mr Justice Simon ruled at the High Court that the case against Mr Straw and Sir Mark Allen, ex-head of counter-terrorism at MI6, should be thrown out.
The government had argued an English court could not adjudicate on claims of rendition and torture in Libya, even though UK officials allegedly knew about them.
The judge said that because most of the claims related to officials in China, Malaysia, Thailand and Libya they were ""non-justiciable"" in the UK.
But on Thursday, appeal court judges said the proceedings were not barred by state immunity.
One of the judges, Lord Dyson, said: ""There is a compelling public interest in the investigation by the English courts of these very grave allegations.
""The stark reality is that unless the English courts are able to exercise jurisdiction in this case, these very grave allegations against the executive will never be subjected to judicial investigation.""
Mr Belhaj was jailed for six years after he returned to Libya. Mrs Boudchar was also imprisoned, but released shortly before giving birth.
The couple have refused so far failed to reach a settlement with the UK government, saying they want it to admit what they say happened.
In March last year, Mr Belhaj offered to settle the case with a token payment of Â£1 from Mr Straw and the government, an apology and an admission of liability - but this was rejected.
Cori Crider, a director at human rights charity Reprieve, which also represents the family, said: ""The government so fears this case going to trial that they have stalled for years by throwing up a parade of scarecrows - claiming, for example, that the United States would be angered if Mr and Mrs Belhaj had their day in court in Britain.
""The court was right: embarrassment is no reason to throw torture victims out of court.""
A statement issued by human rights organisations Amnesty International and the International Commission of Jurists, Justice and Redress said: ""We welcome the decision of the Court of Appeal which now enables the very serious contention that UK authorities and officials were directly implicated in the 'extraordinary rendition' of the claimants to be properly assessed by courts in the UK.""",The family of a Libyan man who claims he was tortured by the UK government have been granted a day in court in England.
36134,"New romance: Tessa Hardy describes the new relationship with BBC newsreader Tim Willcox as ‘casual’ He first made headlines for his affair with his married co-presenter Sophie Long. And yesterday it emerged that BBC newsreader Tim Willcox has moved on to another blonde with a husband – Tessa Hardy, wife of telecoms multi-millionaire Warren Hardy. The pair met at a dinner party in 2013, when Mr Willcox, 51, was still with Miss Long, but struck up a relationship shortly after Mrs Hardy, 53, and her husband began a trial separation. Yesterday friends of Mr Hardy said he was devastated to discover that Mr Willcox had wheedled his way into his wife’s affections when he had been desperately trying to win her back and salvage their 24-year marriage, which produced three children now aged 23, 20 and 17. A source close to Mr Hardy, 58, said recent business problems had placed a strain on his relationship with his wife – who bears a striking resemblance to Miss Long, 37. The friend said: ‘She was very vulnerable when she started a relationship with Tim and he is taking advantage of her. ‘She had only just split from Warren and they were only supposed to be having a short, trial separation. ‘Warren does not think Tim is good for Tessa. She is an attractive, sexy woman and she doesn’t look too dissimilar to Sophie Long, so he clearly has a type. 'This whole thing has been very hard on Warren. Losing his wife has almost ruined him. ‘He always thought that after the trial separation they would be getting back together.’ Mr Hardy made his fortune from his mobile phone business European Telecom. It was floated on the stock exchange in 1996, and by 2000 he appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List as worth £115million. He later founded White Eagle, which developed mobile payment technology. Scroll down for video . In 2000, the family built a £7million mansion in Burnham, Buckinghamshire, complete with indoor and outdoor pools and staff quarters. Mr Hardy’s friend said: ‘Warren worked hard and gave everything to his family. He made sure [Tessa] lived like a princess. Tim won’t be able to provide for her financially. Old flame: Mr Willcox and Sophie Long were co-presenters on the BBC. Mr Willcox left his wife of 17 years - with whom he has four children - for Miss Long . 'Tessa has said Tim provides for her emotionally and sexually.’ Mr Willcox became tangled in a similar scandal in 2012, when he left his wife of 17 years – with whom he has four children – for Miss Long. Separation: Warren and Tessa Hardy who have separated after 24 years of marriage. Mr Hardy is said to be devastated by his wife's new relationship . The pair were presenters on BBC News 24, now renamed the BBC News Channel, and Mr Willcox had been one of the guests at Miss Long’s wedding to childhood sweetheart Will Green just two years earlier. A former member of the British Youth Orchestra, he even serenaded the newlyweds on trumpet. Yesterday Mrs Hardy told the Daily Mail her estranged husband had no grounds for unhappiness about her ‘casual relationship’ with the BBC newsreader, saying: ‘Tim’s divorced and I’m getting divorced. 'We’re both completely free agents to do what we want when we want. ‘I’ve been separated since April, almost a year, I’m not with my husband. I didn’t leave my husband for Tim, I left because I did. 'And I didn’t hook up with Tim until several months after I had separated.’ Mrs Hardy added that Mr Willcox had also been separated from Miss Long ‘for ages’ before she became involved with him. The former housewife now runs Exceptional Pieces, a website selling art and other items. Mr Willcox did not respond to a request for a comment.","Tim Willcox, 51, has moved on to another blonde with a husband, Tessa Hardy.

58072,"The drought of 2012 will be one that farmers and ranchers remember for years to come. My husband, Kevin, and I are fifth-generation farmers. This is the first drought we have experienced since we were married and started farming together in 1995. Our farm, like most other U.S. farms, is really suffering right now and in desperate need of rain. The media have pegged it right: it definitely is the worst drought of our generation. Kevin and I own and raise hogs, cattle, corn, soybeans and alfalfa hay on our farm. Typically, we don't have a lot of crops to farm, but this year we decided to rent an extra 200 acres for that purpose, doubling our row-crop acreage. We were able to purchase crop insurance for most of our crops, but unfortunately that alone will not help make our farm or equipment payments to the bank since most of our crops are ruined. Our crop failure isn't what keeps me awake at night these days; it's worrying about our animals. No crops means no feed for livestock. We can't stop feeding cattle and hogs. We own 60 head of cattle, and our family has 1,500 sows on our farm. Bountiful crops are needed for an adequate feed supply, but so too are healthy pastures for cattle grazing. Both need rain. Hogs eat mostly corn and soybeans because they are not ruminant animals, which means they do not have four stomach chambers like cattle, which can digest hay and grass. The price to purchase corn and soybeans is skyrocketing because of crop losses across most of the United States. Unlike crop farmers, livestock farmers and ranchers do not have insurance programs to ease the losses during disaster years. When our feed costs get out of control, or when a disease devastates our herd, there is no relief from insurance. This is a total loss for farmers and ranchers. To pay the bills, we have to go to the bank and borrow more money to help us survive the storm. This means yet another loan payment. When my expenses increase on our farm, it would be nice to tell the packer who buys my hogs that I need to be paid more so I can make ends meet. But it doesn't work that way. Hogs feel drought's pinch . We are price takers; supply and demand drive the price we are paid for hogs. Even though my feed bills are increasing at alarming rates, right now it doesn't mean that pork demand has increased in line with my expenses. Farmers have to wait for an increase in demand, or decrease in supply, to see their prices increase. I have been asked before why I just don't hold on to our hogs and wait for someone to pay me what I need to pay my feed bills. This is because packers only accept a certain weight so they can meet consumer demand. Consumers want a consistent size piece of pork",Drought of 2012 will be one that farmers and ranchers remember for years to come. Kevin and Kevin are price takers; supply and demand drive the price they are paid for hogs. The drought is the worst drought Kevin has experienced since he started farming in 1995.
87158,"Ivory Coast won their first Africa Cup of Nations since 1992 in dramatic fashion, beating Ghana 9-8 on penalties. Wilfried Bony smashed his spot-kick against the crossbar but the Elephants recovered in the shoot-out, eventually taking the title when goalkeeper Boubacar Barry saved from his opposite number Razak Braimah and then stepped up to score. It was an exciting end to a game that had been anything but, with Premier League stars Bony and Yaya Toure unable to create enough to win the game in 90, or even 120 minutes. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Ivory Coast 0(9)-0(8) Ghana . The Ivory Coast team and staff pose with their Africa Cup of Nations trophy having defeated Ghana 9-8 on penalties on Sunday night . Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony holds up hero Boubacar Barry (centre), who scored the winning penalty in the final in Bata . The Ivory Coast team celebrate landing the Africa Cup of Nations on penalties, their first AFCON title since 1992 . Ghana (4-3-3): Razak; Boye, Rahman, Mensah, Afful; Mubarak, Acquah, Ayew; Atsu (Acheampong, 115), Gyan (Agyemang-Badu, 120) Appiah (Ayew, 98) Subs not used: Sowah, Gyimah, Awal, Rabiu, Asante, Otoo, Amartey, Accam, Dauda . Ivory Coast (4-4-2): Barry; Bailly, Aurier, Kanon, Toure; Tiene (Kalou, 114), Die, Toure, Gradel (Doumbia, 66); Bony, Gervinho (Tallo, 120) Subs not used: Mande, Viera, Roger, Doukoure, Akpa Akpro, Diomande, Traore . Booked: Die, Tiene, Kanon, Bailly . Referee: Bakary Gassama . Toure forced Razak Brimah into a save from an early free kick, and was generally more involved than he has been in the tournament’s previous games. However, once again, the Ivorian captain was less than the star we know he can be when played further forward. Ahead of him Bony was even more frustrated, unable to get into the game and carrying none of the goal-threat that saw him become the Premier League’s top scorer in 2014. Time after time City’s newest striker failed to hold the ball, or to find a team-mate once he had got it under control. Indeed, as has been the case for much of this season, the City stars were outshone for most of the game by a Chelsea counterpart. Christian Atsu, who has shown throughout this tournament why Everton made such an effort to secure him on loan this season, was the best player on the pitch for much of the game. His excellent play on the right wing brought most of Ghana’s attacking joy, most notably when he got in behind and crossed for captain Asamoah Gyan in the 70th minute, only for the former Sunderland striker to miss his kick. And it was Atsu who came closest to finding the net during the 90 minutes which occasionally promised much but eventually delivered little. The Everton winger struck the post with a lovely dipping shot that had beaten Boubacar Barry completely, but didn’t quite have enough bend to take it into the corner of the net. The Black stars hit the upright again not long after, Andre Ayew getting in behind the defence and wrong-footing Barry, only to see his shot go behind off the frame of the goal. Yaya Toure (centre) celebrates having won the Africa Cup of Nations with the Ivory Coast, following a penalty shoot-out win over Ghana . Ivory Coast captain and Manchester star Yaya Toure is presented with the Africa Cup of Nations trophy on Sunday evening . Those near-misses aside, neither side looked much like breaking the deadlock. Neither Barry, playing for the first time in the tournament in the absence of the injured Sylvain Gbohouo, nor Brimah was forced to make too taxing a save, even as the game ticked into extra time. Asamoah Gyan missed his kick when well-placed, John Boye saw a header go just wide, and Jordan Ayew, off the bench to replace Cambridge United’s Kwesi Appiah, wasted a decent half chance for the Black Stars. The Elephants, for their part, were once again content to sit back and let Ghana have the majority of possession, playing much of their best football on the break.

Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony fires towards goal as the Ivory Coast struggled to break down a resolute Ghana side . Former Arsenal forward Gervinho attempts to keep possession for the favourites in the AFCON final against Ghana . Gervinho was a menace from the start, running at defenders with the mix of skilful play and uncontrolled chaos that has become his speciality. The former Arsenal man, as is his way, rarely had much in the way of end product, but he was always a threat for the Ghanain defence. He really should have scored in the second period of extra time, but took a poor touch when he was through on goal. The one time that that Gervinho did pick the perfect pass the opportunity was spurned by Max Gradel, the winger who once plied his trade for Leeds. Following a dreadful mistake from Baba Rahman, Gradel was played in on goal, only to blast over from 15 yards. Ivory Coast's Serge Aurier (centre) attempts an acrobatic overhead kick with the surrounding Ghana defence watching on . Ivory Coast and Manchester City talisman Yaya Toure drives forward under the attention of Ghana's midfielder Afriyie Acquah . It was the Ivorians’ best chance in a game noticeable more for the three red cards that didn’t happen than for anything that did. Asamoah Gyan was the first beneficiary, when he stamped on Eric Bailly off the ball, unspotted by referee Bakary Gassama. Gyan’s team-mate John Boye was equally lucky when he headbutted Eric Bailly in the second half, and Gassama again failed to notice. A referee can only give what he sees, however, so both Ghanaian incidents, though wrong, can be understood. How the official contrived to let Serey Die stay on the pitch, however, is another matter. There is no question he saw the kick to Wakaso Mubarak’s groin, which though not malicious was certainly painful for the Celtic man, and prompted a yellow card. Ivory Coast coach Herve Renard reacts as a decision goes against his side during the AFCON final on Sunday evening . Ghana's midfielder Andre Ayew (right) challenges Ivory Coast's midfielder Serey Die as their sides vie for the AFCON 2015 title . He also awarded a free kick when the Ivorian midfield cynically chopped down Atsu to stop an attack, but inexplicably decided it was not worthy of a second yellow card. It was the closest we came to drama at Estadio de Bata until the shoot-out. But as the remnants of the Ivorian ‘golden generation’ now know, waiting a long time for success makes it all the sweeter.

47286,"Would he be interested in David Cameron having one of his paintings to pass on as a gift to the most powerful man in the world?
""My first thought was 'wow, Ronald MacDonald is going to have one of my paintings - amazing!""
Eine, whose perky typography has been popping up across London for a number of years, chuckles at the memory of how his professional life has been turned on its head.
To date, his highest profile work has been a collaboration with handbag designer Anya Hindmarch, and spray painting the entire alphabet on the shop shutters of a street in Spitalfields in his signature ice-cream palette.
Now, his work has made its way to Washington DC and the walls of the White House.
It's a long way for the south London-born street artist who started out because he ""wanted to be part of that hooded track suit gang thing"".
""I was just completely shocked, yeah, just completely shocked and completely amazed to get that call,"" admits the 39-year-old.
""I'm not a massive artist by any stretch of the imagination. Yes, I've been in papers and magazines, but you never have any idea if anyone actually reads it or pays any attention.
""So, to receive a phone call from Number 10 saying they like your work, they want a piece of your work, and they want to give it to President Obama, it's like this can't be happening, this can't be true, it's just too weird.""
But it was true and, this week, Cameron handed the Â£2,500 canvas - entitled Twentyfirst Century City - to President Obama, along with scented candles for his wife and two pairs of candy-coloured wellies for the kids.
""I had a little think about it before I said 'Yes',"" admits Eine, who has gradually been making a name for himself on the street-art scene.
""I assessed the pros and the cons, and I went back to them and said 'Yeah, cool, what are you interested in?'""
The 'cons' in this case were Eine's fear he would be branded a sell-out by his peers, or that the painting would be left in bubble wrap and abandoned in a darkened room in the White House.
The 'pros' were summed up with the name of one artist - Shepherd Fairey.
Fairey's now famous Hope poster, a stencil portrait of Obama in red, white and blue, became an iconic symbol during the 2008 presidential campaign.
""I wasn't prepared to give them something I felt wasn't going to be looked at and appreciated,"" says Eine.
""But Obama used the poster by Shepard Fairey - probably the most famous street artist besides Banksy - so it was clear to me he has an idea and an appreciation of street art.
""So the fact that I'm comfortable it's going to go up on a wall somewhere was a 'Yes', and the fact it was going to Obama - and he is a dude - was a 'Yes' too.
""If it had been going to one of the old presidents, then I probably would have said no.""
The three feet by two feet canvas was chosen by Cameron's political aides from a selection suggested by Eine.
He describes his typography-based work as ""negative words painted in a beautiful and a happy way"" and admits he was pushed to find something suitable at first.
""Because of the time frame, it had to be something I had already painted, so there wasn't a massive amount they could choose from,"" he said. ""They couldn't exactly give him a painting that said 'monsters' or 'delinquents'.
""I e-mailed some images that I had and at the last minute, I remembered about a painting I had in a gallery in Brighton, so I sent them a picture of Twentyfirst Century City.
""They came back immediately and said 'Yeah, we love it, Can we have it?' And I was like 'Yeah... that's cool'.""
Now Eine is hoping to get some feedback from Downing Street on what Obama thought of his work.
""Hopefully I'll get a photo of the handover with the two of them standing there with their cheesy grins and their thumbs up,"" he laughs. ""I'd put that on my wall - my 15 minutes of Andy Warhol fame.
""It's a bit of a fairytale story for me, really, one that will hopefully have a happy ending.""","Artist Mark Eine says he was ""completely shocked"" when he received a phone call from Number 10 asking him to paint a canvas for President Obama."

A dozy drug dealer was caught when police found a photo on his phone of him wearing a crown made of 20 pound notes and a bag of cannabis hanging from his mouth. Ayub Hagos, from Abbey Wood, London, was arrested after officers searched a flat in Southsea, Hampshire last October and found a haul of drugs and cash. The 19-year-old denied having anything to do with the drugs until police took a look at his phone and discovered a gallery of photos of cash, guns, knives and white powder. Incriminating photo: Ayub Hagos poses with wads of £20 notes, a crown made from cash and a bag of cannabis in his mouth . He pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing a class A drug with intent to supply and was jailed for three-and-a-half years at Portsmouth Crown Court on Friday. Police who raided the flat found 23 wraps of crack cocaine, with a street value of £920, 11 wraps of heroin, worth £440, a knuckle-duster and 500 pounds cash in his bag. Hagos was alleged to have travelled from his home in London to the south coast to sell the drugs. Caught red-handed: Hagos also had a picture on his phone of him admiring his drugs with a pile of cash on his lap . During his trial, Hagos' barrister Alexander Thompson told the court he had been naive. Hagos denied having anything to do with the drugs, until police found the incriminating photos on his phone . Mr Thompson said: 'He took the photographs as bravado to make himself seem more important in front of his peers. 'It is incredibly naive for a sophisticated drug dealer to have these sort of photographs on his phone.' Prosecutor Matthew Lawson said: 'The crown would certainly say it is an overwhelming case. 'The photographs are such that the defendant would have had difficulty in disassociating himself with the drugs.' The court heard he had previous convictions for possessing cannabis and assault. Sentencing him, Judge Richard Price said: 'You came down from London with class A drugs, crack cocaine and heroin, to sell in this city. 'I am satisfied that is the sole purpose of your visit to this city. 'You are more than a street dealer, you are a supplier to those who sell on the streets. 'I’m entirely satisfied that in all the circumstances of this case you played a significant role.'","Ayub Hagos, 19, jailed for three-and-a-half years after admitting possessing a class A drug with intent to supply."

The best tweets are displayed at the top of a user’s timeline when they open the site, and are similar to the 'Top stories' prioritised on Facebook. Twitter has started to roll out its ‘while you were away’ feature (example pictured), which offers some users of the social network a selection of important tweets that may have missed since they last logged in . The feature was spotted by a number of users over Christmas. It works in a similar way to Facebook’s news feed feature, which ranks status updates in terms of importance, instead of in chronological order. The Facebook tool has previously angered some users who believe they should be able to choose how stories appear - and the Twitter update is likely to cause similar frustrations. The site  did not reveal how it prioritises tweets, or what it considers 'important'. Twitter announced its plans to roll out features to boost engagement in November, stating at the time: ‘Every time you open the Twitter app, you’ll see something great.’ It added: ‘We can use information like who you follow and what you engage with to surface highlights of what you missed and show those to you as soon as you log back in or come back to the app.’ The best tweets are displayed at the top of a user’s timeline when they open the app (pictured) or website - a new feature, which has delighted some, while annoying others who took to Twitter to complain . It works in a similar way to Facebook’s Top stories news feed feature, which ranks status updates in terms of importance, instead of in chronological order (pictured). The Facebook tool has previously angered some users who believe they should be able to choose how stories appear . In November Twitter revealed its plans for the ‘while you were away’ feature. Here is what it said in a blog post: . 'Right now, what you see of the 500 million tweets published every day is based entirely on who you follow, and that’s a great model for many people. 'But with that many tweets every day, there’s no way even the most avid Twitter user will find everything that’s relevant to their interests in any particular moment. 'That’s why we’re exploring ways to surface relevant tweets so the content that is interesting to you is easy to discover - whether you stay on Twitter all day or visit for a few minutes - while still preserving the real-time nature of the platform that makes Twitter special. 'For instance, we’re experimenting with better ways to give you what you come to Twitter for: a snapshot of what’s happening. 'We can use information like who you follow and what you engage with to surface highlights of what you missed and show those to you as soon as you log back in or come back to the app. 'We’re also working on ideas such as an instant, personalised timeline for new users who don’t want to spend time cultivating one on their own.' Now, it appears that more and more users are seeing the ‘while you were away’ changes, with some noticing the new feature in early December, TechCrunch reported. It is the first major new feature rolled out by the company, based in San Francisco, California, since it launched promoted tweets and adverts, which also buck its chronological approach. Twitter declined to comment when MailOnline asked when all users will see the update, and if it will be an optional feature. The tool is designed to attract a user's attention to important tweets that can get easily lost in the rapid flow of information, especially if they follow hundreds of people, or do not check their feed very regularly. A staggering 500 million tweets are published every day. People reacted on Twitter to the change, with some pouring scorn on the new feature. One user wrote: '#Twitter new feature to tell me what happened while I was away. I was away because I didn't want to know anything', while another said: ‘Why does Twitter show me tweets from last night ""while you were away"" .. Wack.’ However, one Californian user was among many who praised the change, saying: ‘Love the 'While You Were Away' feature at Twitter. Achieves its purpose without affecting real time news feed!’ The new feature may be seen as a move by Twitter to close in on Facebook’s social media lead, which has 1.3 billion users, compared to Twitter’s 284 million. Twitter is expected to roll out another new feature called ‘instant timeline’ to reinvigorate current users and attract news ones early this year.

Other residents of the areas affected by the storm have suffered an even worse blow, as a spate of burglaries hit the region over the Thanksgiving holiday. Jonathan Saporta of Great Neck stands with his bill that charged him for a full cycle of power even though he had no power for 15 days . Victims of Robbery: The ruins of burned out homes are framed by surviving buildings in the Breezy Point section of the Queens borough of New York, today. One man, Jonathan Saporta . had the misfortune to get two bills from the power company - one for . $649 for the Long Beach home that he had to leave in October and another . $281 demand for the new home he has set up in Great Neck. 'I can’t get LIPA to acknowledge my existence on earth to talk to me about anything,' said Saporta to the New York Post. 'But I guess they had power, so they could print my bills. Nice, right?' The beleaguered restaurateur moved to the Great Neck home on October 1st and was sent a bill for a full 43-day cycle that included the two weeks he spent without power following the October 29th storm. 'I am not paying any of my bills, that much I promise,' said Saporta. 'They can put me into collections, and I’ll fight them tooth-and-nail. It’s simply criminal.' Another man, Michael Hilferty, 29, an attorney from Long Beach received a bill via email, which the power company worked out as being one dollar more than the previous month. 'Insult to injury': Queens resident Robert Bainbridge was disgusted to discover that his home had been broken in to by burglars just weeks after the area was devastated by Sandy .

'To get this message on Thanksgiving was crass and classless. It’s just heartless,' he said. The lawyer suffered seven feet of flooding into his oceanfront home and was blasted with four feet of sand. He has not lived in the property since October 29th, yet was sent a bill for a full 29 days of electricity  usage. This comes as more misery was piled on for Sandy victims as some residents of Breezy Point, the neighbourhood that suffered fire and flooding during Superstorm Sandy say thieves looted their damaged houses over Thanksgiving. One couple lost a $25,000 coin collection along with jewelry and watches. The break-ins occurred on Wednesday or Thursday when many residents were away for the holiday.

'Whoever did this is not thinking, ""This could happen to me.""' Another victim of the break-ins called them a 'terrible violation' while one woman who did not want to be named said, 'It's just been one big ordeal.' The couple who lost their $25,000 silver half dollars told the New York Post they were more upset by the loss of their pair of stolen watches. One was a gift from the husband to his wife and the other was given to the husband by his employer on the day of his retirement. 'Those are more sentimental to me,' he said to the New York Post. 'People aren’t here during the week, so when they come back on the weekend, they notice their stuff is gone.' Explaining their shock and disappointment, the couple revealed that in the last 30 years they had not been robbed once.","Residents of Breezy Point, New York, have been hit by a spate of burglaries over the Thanksgiving holiday.

53924,"Police interviewed Lord Brittan about the claim in 2014 but he died last year unaware the inquiry had been dropped.
In the private meeting, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe is expected to be questioned about the length of time Scotland Yard took to conclude its investigation.
Lord Brittan had denied the historical allegation against him.
The Crown Prosecution Service found in July 2013 that there was not enough evidence for a prosecution over the claim that Lord Brittan had raped a 19-year-old female student in 1967, but the case was reopened less than a year later.
Police interviewed Lord Brittan, who was suffering from terminal cancer, in May 2014, but no charges were brought. Lord Brittan passed away in January 2015.
In a letter last year, a senior officer apologised to Lady Brittan saying she should have been told earlier that had he been alive, Lord Brittan would not have been prosecuted.
Investigating officers had told the complainant this in April 2015, a Met report into the handling of the case revealed, but Lord Brittan's legal team were not told at the same time.
Scotland Yard said it had delayed telling the peer when he was alive because the CPS had been asked to carry out a final review of the case.
A Met spokesman also said that notifying the complainant in April had been ""premature"", because the CPS did not confirm it would not pursue the case until June 2015.
Scotland Yard has faced criticism over its handling of the case but a review - carried out by Dorset Police and published earlier this month - found its investigation of the claim was ""fully justified"".
The former home secretary has also been the subject of a separate investigation as part of Operation Midland, Scotland Yard's inquiry into allegations of a paedophile ring at the heart of Westminster.
The BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw says it is understood Sir Bernard will also be asked about this investigation in the meeting.

Dressed in beaded skirts, clutching machetes and mobile phones, women and girls danced and sang tributes to the king and queen mother - also known as the Great She-Elephant - in a traditional Umhlanga Reed Dance to celebrate womanhood and virginity. Those taking part dismissed criticism of the extravagant celebrations on Sunday and Monday, which took place in one of Africa's poorest countries, ruled by the continent's last absolute monarch. Virgins: Maidens sing and dance outside the Queen Mother's Royal Palace after delivering reeds at Ludzidzini in Mbabane, Swaziland, on Sunday, ahead of Monday's Reed Dance . Celebrations: Thousand of virgins took part in the event in honour of a royal family which has in some quarters been criticised for being out of touch with a country where many live in abject poverty . National pride: Many of the women taking part stressed their dedication to their king and their chastity . 'I'm proud to be Swazi and to be a virgin. We are here to show unity with the king and with each other,' said 18-year-old Gcebine Dlamini. She braced herself against the cold of the southern hemisphere's winter in her skimpy outfit as scores of tourists had photos taken next to the topless women. King Mswati III, who has at least a dozen wives and a personal fortune estimated at $200million, faced unprecedented protests last year when his appointed administration ran out of money after a 2009 recession in neighbouring South Africa.

'If chosen, I would be able to live a better life than what I have, have a lot of money, live a queen's life and travel overseas,' said Fakazile Dlamini, 14, who arrived on a lorry from her village 60km away to attend the ceremony. New royal wives have often received a BMW and their own palace, fuelling criticism in a country where more than two-thirds of its 1.4million people live in abject poverty. Women's groups and political opponents also say Mswati's penchant for multiple young brides is out of touch in a country with the world's highest rate of HIV/AIDS. The monarch says polygamy is part of Swazi tradition and helps cement national unity.

56899,"More than 600,000 white British Londoners have left the capital in a decade. Census figures show that between 2001 and 2011 the level of ‘white flight’ reached 620,000. It is the equivalent of a city the size of Glasgow – made up entirely of white Britons – moving out of the capital. White Britons are now a minority in the country's capital with 620,000 leaving in a decade . The figures, reported by the BBC . yesterday, mean that for the first time, white Britons are now in a . minority in the country’s largest city. At the same time, the census shows, . some rural areas have seen a rise in the proportion of people who . describe their ethnicity as ‘white British’. Some 3.7million Londoners classified . themselves as white British in 2011 – down from 4.3million in 2001 – . despite the city’s population increasing by nearly one million over the . decade to 8.2million. Sir Andrew Green of MigrationWatch thinks that the BBC should have addressed such a serious issue less trivially . White Britons now make up 45 per cent of the population, compared with 58 per cent in 2001. London’s population has been boosted by immigrants. Three million foreign-born people now live in the capital. Five London boroughs saw the . proportion of white Britons fall by more than a quarter. The largest . decline was in Newham, East London, where the decrease was 37.5 per . cent. In Barking and Dagenham, on the East . London/Essex border, 80 per cent of residents were white British in 2001 . but by 2011 the proportion was 49 per cent. There were also big falls in . Redbridge, Harrow, Brent, Enfield, Ealing and Waltham Forest. The BBC . website was criticised by readers for its depiction of the change as a . ‘story of success’ in which many white Britons had moved out to live by . the sea or in the countryside. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the . MigrationWatch think-tank, said: ‘The BBC make a very serious mistake in . addressing an issue of such importance to the British public in such a . trivial and superficial manner. ‘It’s surely obvious that the main . reason for white flight is because people are not willing to live in an . environment which has changed beyond recognition and against their own . wishes.’ Ralph Baldwin, a Tory councillor in Barking and Dagenham, said: ‘I think people left for a variety of reasons. ‘If you look back to the early 2000s . many people were able to retire to Clacton-on-Sea and they saw their . friends going and followed. ‘But people also watched all this . demographic change going on between 2000 and 2010 and they thought, “We . don’t know where we are living any more”. ‘One day they are in a place that they think is Essex and then they are living in another place. ‘It has never been an issue of race. It’s about the inability of people . to affect change. The world was changing around them and they couldn’t . do anything about it.’ Behind white Britons, the largest . ethnic group in London is now Asians – including those born here and . those arriving from overseas – who make up 18 per cent of the . population. Black Londoners – including Africans, black Britons and those from the Caribbean – make up 13 per cent. The census shows the proportion of white Britons in South Derbyshire went up by 13.7 per cent over the decade. Other rural boroughs that saw big . increases included North Kesteven and West Lindsey in Lincolnshire, . Uttlesford in Essex, East Northamptonshire, East Cambridgeshire, Mid . Suffolk, South Norfolk, Mid Devon and Forest Heath in Suffolk. The census shows the population of .

43872,"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . A gold-rush has hit a seaside town - after a German artist buried £10,000 worth of bullion as part of an arts festival. Hundreds of amateur treasure hunters flocked to a beach at Folkestone, Kent earlier today in a bid to get their hands on a share of the solid gold deliberately buried in the sand. Excited children with their parents, hobby archeologists and competitive teens packed the beach at low tide to try and find the hidden bullion. Scroll down for video . Some treasure hunters believe that using a bigger shovel is the most effective way of finding the gold . While others have been digging in a more delicate and controlled manner akin to archaeology . More than 250 treasure hunters tried their luck earlier today digging on their own mini claims on the beach . Sculptor Michael Sailstorfer has concealed 30 24-carat gold bars on the beach at the outer harbour of the English Channel town as an art project. The search started at 4pm on Thursday with 150 people arriving to begin digging. But by Friday lunchtime there were around 250 hunters armed with buckets, spades and even metal detectors. More are expected over the weekend. Friends John Daniels, 25, and Ben Helps, 26, travelled from Bournemouth in Dorset to try and get their hands on some buried treasure. Some of the treasure hunters came armed with metal detectors with reports that the local Argos had even sold out of the high-tech devices . They stood in one of the deepest holes on the beach as the dug down looking for the precious metal. But as the tide closed in they said they have had no luck yet. John said: 'Yesterday we didn't dig, we just stood up the top and watched - getting tactics to see where other people have and haven't dug. 'It's strange because although there's quite a few people down here, everyone's doing it randomly. There's no sense of unity at the moment.' Ben - standing in his boxers as parts of the two-foot trench begin to close in around him - said: 'I quite like the them and us attitude going on at the moment. It's really competitive.' But some people have other ideas and have joined up with neighbouring diggers to form a united front. Folkestone mum Jacky Dannahy, 42, and her son Joseph have teamed up with the Bridges' family and promised to share the wealth. Dressed in a camouflage jacket, with an army hat and a patch on his eye, Joseph, six, said: 'I've made friends with these boys and now we're all like pirates. So we help each other.' The beach, which becomes partly covered at high tide, is open to the public, leaving a free-for-all approach to the adventure. University student Ross Haigger, 21, and his nephews, Oscar and Daniel Daley, said they were finding the experience a lot of fun. Daniel, five, said: 'We haven't found anything yet but we hope we will. If I do find gold I am going to buy one million thousand ice creams.' But Oscar, three, said: 'If I found treasure I'd hide it from Daniel.' One child thought he hit the jackpot when he uncovered this gold-coloured bar - unfortunately it's fake . Others seem to believe that digging in the sand was its own reward and gold bars would be a bonus . Despite rumours of the event being a hoax, today no one doubted that thousands of pounds of gold lay hidden beneath their feet. Father-of-two Mark Anderson, from Canterbury, said: 'I've watched people keep themselves to themselves, taking the whole thing very professionally, and then disappear in the middle of their dig. 'People are obviously finding them - rumour has it maybe three or four - and are just quietly wandering home with a smile on their face.' The stunt is part of the Berlin sculptor's piece for this year's Triennial - an art festival which starts tomorrow. Defying convention, this gentleman has decided to deploy his walking stick to probe the sand . The bars of gold weigh 10 grams and 20 grams and are worth £250 and £500  each. It is believed one bar was found on Thursday evening but the unknown treasure hunter has kept their find close to their chest. The gold fever meant that a branch of Argos in Folkestone completely ran out of metal detectors as savvy hunters used technology in a bid to find the loot. But it is understood metal washers have also been buried in the sand to make it harder for metal detectors to get an accurate reading - to give people with just spades a better chance of success. Some of the treasure hunters have returned to the beach for the second time today to hunt for gold . The piece, called Folkestone Digs, has been commissioned by the Bristol-based arts producers Situations, an organisation that say they are trying to change the perception of what public art can be. Director, Claire Doherty, said: 'I am so pleased with how well this has gone. 'It has been the biggest secret to keep as we've been working on it for a year. 'In fact, when we were hiding the gold at four in the morning a dog walker came up to us and said 'What're you up to then? Digging for treasure?'. 'I looked at her for a moment and then she laughed and said 'No, really, what are you doing?' We had to make up a story that we were testing the sand. 'So often public art funding is spent on a sculpture or a bauble on a roundabout and part of what we do is to say, actually sometimes a temporary project can have as much impact in the collective memory as something that has been there a long time. 'Art helps you explore places and I think what the artist wanted was exactly what you see here today - people away from their iPads and computer screens, alive with imagination and excitement.' Festival director Claire Doherty said she is very pleased with the success of the event so far . Event staff have been working on the gold plan for more than a year and managed to keep the treasure secret .","German artist buried 30 24-carat gold bars on a beach in Folkestone, Kent.

83045,"A woman who claimed a taxi driver sexually assaulted her at knifepoint in his cab has been jailed after he used a recording application on his smartphone to expose her lies. Astria Berwick, 27, slashed herself in the face with a knife in an effort to convince police that she had been attacked and groped by Mohammed Asif. The driver was arrested within three hours and taken to a police station in handcuffs. 'Outrageous behaviour': After travelling home from a night out in Mohammed Asif's taxi, Astria Berwick called police and falsely accused the father-of-two of sexually assaulting her in the cab . 'Wholly innocent': Mr Asif, 34, was able to prove his innocence thanks to an app on his mobile phone which captured an audio recording of Berwick's cab journey . He was stripped and spent a day in a . cell until officers  eventually listened to the recording and . discovered  Berwick was lying. Yesterday, as she started a 16-month . jail term for perverting the course of justice, Mr Asif, 34, said that . without the app he would now be the one in jail. The father of two said: ‘Nothing like . this has ever happened to me before, and I have never been involved with . the police. Now I am terrified if I pick a single lady up. ‘I think her sentence was too short. She could have completely ruined my life. She should have got three or . four years at the very least.’ Mr Asif used his Samsung Galaxy S2’s . voice recorder  to tape Berwick’s 11-mile  journey from Nottingham  to . her home in Bingham  after his base told him she appeared to be drunk . when making the 4.50pm booking in February. He said that while the journey went . smoothly, apart from when  he had to pull over in a lay-by to allow her . to vomit, Berwick argued about the £17 fare when he picked her up, which . he believes may be why  she made the allegation against him. After the journey, she thanked him twice. He started out to return to base, but was stopped by police. Officers told Mr Asif that Berwick . claimed he pounced on her from behind when she vomited by the side of . the road before cutting her with a knife. The taxi driver, who lives in Carlton Hills, Nottingham, was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault. He said: ‘They took everything from . me, including  my clothes, and I was crying in the cell. I told them . there was a recording on my phone – I was saying “please check it”.’ Lies: Mr Asif, who told how he broke down in a police cell after he was falsely accused of sexual assault, said Berwick's lies had torn his life apart . ‘The woman only wanted  to pay £11 and had to go to  a cash machine to get more money. She wasn’t very happy. ‘I don’t record all my journeys, but the office told me she had been drinking and that I should ask for payment up front. ‘So I put my phone on the dashboard cradle and left it on. If I hadn’t, I would be in jail now, I am certain of that. ‘My son is 14 and my daughter is eight. They were crying when I came back and were asking why I had been arrested. ‘The police raided my house and searched my taxi looking for the knife which she says I used to cut her with. ‘She really has turned my life upside down.’ Berwick was jailed at Nottingham Crown . Court after she admitted perverting the course of justice. Judge . Michael Stokes QC said  she had pretended to be  the victim of sexual . assault for ‘some unaccountable reason’. He told her: ‘This was outrageous . behaviour by the defendant against a wholly innocent man who was saved . by the recording on his phone. ‘Had he not recorded the conversation . which demonstrated that nothing untoward had occurred, he would probably . still be in custody awaiting trial.’ On her Facebook page, Berwick says she . is ‘honest as I don’t like lying (that’s probably my downfall, too . honest)’ and ‘enjoys a good joke (sometimes at other people’s expense)’. She lists her favourite quotations as ‘do unto others as they would do unto you’, and ‘what comes around goes around’.","Astria Berwick, 27, claimed Mohammed Asif, 34, sexually assaulted her in his cab.

Bosses at Woodside Wildlife Park have now stepped in to save it and will move it to their site near Langworth.
It will be used as an attraction housing exotic animals and coral reef aquariums.
The conservatory is named after the Lincolnshire botanist who travelled with Captain James Cook on his first voyage to the South Pacific in 1768.
The Grade II listed Lawn complex was sold by City of Lincoln Council last year to the Stokes coffee company which plans to open a cafe and museum on the site.

""I, like a lot of people, spent my younger days coming here and bringing my children here,"" he said.
""When I heard that it was being demolished and closing down, I thought we were probably in as good a place as anybody to save it.""
Once rebuilt, the conservatory will be used for education and conservation projects, while retaining its heritage as a journey of discovery, Mr Mumby said.

15177,"By . Ruth Sunderland, Associate City Editor . PUBLISHED: . 04:53 EST, 17 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:26 EST, 18 March 2013 . A fabulously wealthy Qatari investment fund is  plotting an £8billion takeover bid for Marks & Spencer. Shares in the much-loved store rose sharply at the end of last week due to City speculation that the Qatar Investment Authority, which manages the Gulf state’s wealth, is about to launch a bid. The Qataris have been sounding out several private equity firms about forming a consortium to make a bid for M&S and have spoken to banks about loan finance. Under threat? Qatar Investment Authority is reportedly planning a £8billion bid on Marks And Spencer . A takeover of M&S would mean yet . another high-profile British company being surrendered to foreign . ownership following the sale of a list of historic business names . including Cadbury’s and ICI to overseas buyers. It would also be the boldest move yet . in Qatar’s multi-billion-pound UK shopping spree. The emirate recently . bought the Olympic Village in East London. In 2010 it bought Harrods . from Mohamed Al-Fayed. Qatar has also taken large stakes  in . Sainsbury’s, the London Stock Exchange and Barclays, which it helped . save from needing a bailout  from the British government at the peak of . the financial crisis. Marc Bolland, chief executive of Marks . & Spencer, is struggling to improve the performance of the . 129-year-old company, which has 700 stores in the UK and employs 78,000 . staff. The retailer reported a 1.8 per cent fall in sales over the key . Christmas period and is valued on the stock market at £6billion. Its shares were priced at 372.5p when the markets closed last week. That is still well below the £4 a . share Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green offered in a failed bid for Marks . nine years ago. Qatar is smaller than Belgium with a population of just . under two million, but its population is the wealthiest on the planet . thanks to its natural gas and oil reserves. The sovereign wealth fund eyeing . M&S is one of the most powerful in the world, and is run by the . Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al-Thani. Its purpose is to invest the . country’s  oil and gas riches in various overseas assets so Qataris are . less vulnerable to a fall in energy prices. But critics fear Qatar’s treasure chest here could give it too much influence over corporate Britain.

5586,"For the first time since the 2008 presidential race, Hillary Clinton made a foray back into the thorny world of campaign politics on Saturday, appearing at a rally for Terry McAuliffe, the longtime Clinton confidante now running for governor of Virginia. About 500 people showed up to the historic State Theatre in Falls Church, a suburb of Washington, D.C. to witness Clinton's smiling re-emergence on the political scene, showering her with applause when she made even the slightest allusion to running for office again. What did we learn about her future plans as she considers a repeat bid for the White House in 2016? Not much at all, actually. But here are three important takeaways from Clinton's first big political speech since leaving the State Department earlier this year: . She was relaxed . Never a dynamic speaker on the stump in 2008, Clinton was instead relaxed, confident and authoritative on Saturday. It's not hard to see why. This was a supremely low-risk event for Clinton -- as perfect a re-entry into national politics as she could have asked for. Barring some kind of wacky collapse in the final three weeks of the race, McAuliffe is generally expected to defeat his Republican opponent Ken Cuccinelli, though some Democrats here expect the winning margin to be a few points smaller than the eight-point lead he holds in the polls, given the usual GOP turnout edge in an off-year. The former secretary of state has a close personal friendship with McAuliffe, a longtime fundraiser, poker buddy, cheerleader, political fixer and all-purpose confidant for the Clintons. The event's frame -- it was billed as a ""Women For Terry"" rally -- was right in Clinton's strike zone, giving her a chance to talk about politics in terms she feels most comfortable. ""The whole country is watching to see if the rights of women and girls will be respected, especially over our own bodies and our health care,"" she said of the Virginia race, alluding to Cuccinelli's efforts as a state legislator and attorney general to curb access to abortion. Add it all up, and Clinton was completely at ease on Saturday, campaigning in front a fawning audience in the Washington suburbs, talking about women's issues and propping up one of her longtime pals. ""I thought hard about what I wanted to say to Virginians today,"" she said. ""I've been out of politics for a few years now. And I've had a chance to think a lot about what makes our country so great. What kind of leadership is required to keep it great."" How long can Hillary Clinton wait? She wasn't afraid to jab Republicans, however gently . Clinton stayed mostly positive, but she didn't shy away from taking a few shots at Republicans, albeit not by name. Talking about the political gridlock on Capitol Hill that led to a 16-day government shutdown this month, she said that ""we have seen examples of the wrong kind of leadership"" in recent days, an unmistakable poke at House Republicans. ""Politicians choose scorched-earth over common ground,"" she continued. ""They operate in what I called the evidence-free-zone, with ideology trumping everything else,"" she said, before listing the consequences of the shutdown, such as furloughed workers and ""children thrown out of Head Start."" Clinton also made sure to highlight Republican efforts to enforce stricter abortion regulations in Virginia. McAuliffe, she said, would ""stand up against attempts to restrict women's health choices."" Rounding out her speech, Clinton alluded to Alexis de Tocqueville, the French writer who described Americans as having ""habits of the heart"" when he traveled to the U.S. nearly 200 years ago. But Clinton warned that such a spirit is under threat. ""We cannot let those who do not believe in America's progress hijack this great experiment, and substitute for the habits of the heart suspicion, hatred, anger, anxiety. That's not as a people who we are."" Clinton on possible presidency: 'I'm realistic' She executed the McAuliffe game plan . As much as Clinton was the story here, time and again she served as a character witness for McAuliffe, whom Republicans have relentlessly attacked as a carnival barker and Washington insider. ""I've seen the values that he was raised with,"" Clinton said of McAuliffe, standing next to her on stage at the State Theatre, along with his wife Dorothy. ""He grew up in a middle class family. He was taught about the dignity of work and the importance of looking out for each other. He started his first business at the age of 14 because he knew he was going to have to put himself through school. He's lived those values."" The Clinton appearance was straight out of McAuliffe's playbook from day one. No one in Virginia is surprised that his campaign deployed Clinton at this late stage of the game, an effort to stir up scads of press attention and drown out the cash-strapped Cuccinelli, who is not even airing television ads in the crucial northern Virginia media market this weekend, two ad-buying sources told CNN. Cuccinelli spent Saturday rallying the conservative base with Mike Huckabee in central Virginia. The Democrats' goal is to lock in McAuliffe's lead and keep their boot on Cuccinelli's neck as they head into the final stretch. And guess what: former President Bill Clinton, the big dog himself, will also be campaigning for McAuliffe in the coming weeks. Date TBD.","Hillary Clinton made her first big political appearance since leaving the State Department. She appeared at a rally for Terry McAuliffe, a longtime confidante for Clintons.

82279,"From Shakepeare's terrifying crones to the Hansel and Gretel sorceress with a taste for cannibalism, witches have long exercised a malevolent hold on the popular imagination. Now the witch is the subject of a new exhibition at the British Museum which runs until January and charts the journey of the wicked enchantress from the medieval era to the beginning of the 20th century. Featuring works by Durer, Delacroix and Rossetti among others, it delves into the near universal terror of witches - and the equally dreadful consequences for the women caught up. Scroll down for video . Iconic: This engraving of the Three Weird Sisters  is one of the most famous witch images ever made . But early witches weren't the horrid hags of the Middle Ages. Many, among them Lilith, thought to be the first wife of Adam and his equal, sorceress Circe and Hercules' unfaithful wife Medea, were as beautiful as they were powerful. The theme of the witch as a powerful woman resurfaced again in the Middle Ages, when witches, although no longer lovely to look at, were presented as having the ability to control the weather or strike down grown men and infants alike. Pagan associations with classical gods and goddesses, in particular Diana the Huntress, compounded the malevolent reputation of the witch as Christian priests railed against what they saw as an abomination and a heresy. But although most witches were women, men and children were also accused of witchcraft during the medieval period as people, seeing catastrophes such as the Black Death and internecine warfare unfold around them, blamed sorcery for their ills. Terrifying: Works by Hans Baldung Grien (left) and Albrecht Durer (right) entrenched the idea of evil witches . Unsurprisingly, this led to persecution, mostly of women, with attempts to eradicate witchcraft gathering speed as the 14th century began. By 1563, it had been made a capital offence in Britain as well as in much of Western Europe; a law that resulted in the deaths of an estimated 200,000 women between 1484 and 1750. But the terror induced by the thought of witchcraft wasn't entirely the fault of imagination alone - as the new exhibition makes plain, the flowering of the arts went hand in hand with an uptick in witchcraft cases. Leading the charge were the print-makers, whose cheap and cheerful pamphlets, books and engravings meant that terrifying images of evil hags spread among all sections of the population. From 1500 onwards, pamphlets outlining the supposed malign powers of the witch became commonplace, while cheap copies of the notorious Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of the Witches) were available to all. Witch trials, as a result, became increasingly common during the 16th and 17th centuries, in particular during periods of civil unrest. Frightening: Veneziano's The Witches’ Rout (The Carcass) is typical of the terrifying witches of the 15th century . Terror: Witches were often depicted riding supernatural creatures as seen here in Jan de Bisschop's work . Much of the art that fuelled them, however, was striking. Among them were single-sheet prints made by the Renaissance print-makers Albrecht Dürer and Hans Baldung Grien - both of which rapidly became popular with collectors. One that did particularly well was Grien's The Witches' Sabbath, a colour woodcut print from 1510 that depicts four nude female figures sitting on the ground with a cauldron. The cauldron is emitting big plumes of smoke and traces of a potion with frogs round the figures, the ground is littered with bones, pitchforks and to the right of the image a cat is sitting with its back turned. In the night sky, another two witches, one barely visible, the other riding a goat and carrying a pitchfork with another cauldron and animal bones. The figure of a witch riding backwards on a goat in Baldung’s work is said to have been inspired by Dürer’s engraving of the very same name. Made circa 1500, A Witch Riding Backwards on a Goat is an allegory for how witchcraft was thought to reverse the natural order of things, so the hair of the witch streams out in one direction, while the goat and the trail of drapery go the other way. Change: Works such as the Siren Vase showed witches as beauties - a stance embraced by the Victorians . Finely wrought: However horrid their subject matter, works by Luis Paret y Alcazar and Goya remain lovely . But not every witch was depicted as a horrid hag. Witches were also shown as bewitching seductresses intent on ensnaring their male victims, a type loved by Giovanni Battisa Castiglione, an artist famous for his etchings of Circe. By contrast, Francisco de Goya  turned the subject of witches into an art form all of its own and took the grotesque to new heights courtesy of his penchant for compositions that showed women conducting hideous activities on animals and children. During the eighteenth century, Henry Fuseli’s Weird Sisters from Macbeth influenced generations of theatre-goers, and illustrations of Goethe’s Faust were popularised by Eugène Delacroix. By the end of the 19th century, hideous old hags with distended breasts and snakes for hair were mostly replaced by sexualised and mysteriously exotic sirens, most famously in Dante Gabriel Rossetti's depictions of Lilith. This new approach to witches was mirrored in the treatment of suspected witches in the real world too, with witch trials and burnings finally consigned to history as the 20th century dawned.","Exhibition charts journey of wicked enchantress from medieval era to 20th century.

17638,"DUP social conservatism - including its opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion - has caused concern, including for some within the Conservative Party.
The party's past and present policies are providing rich pickings for satirists as the British public try to figure out who their government has got into bed with.
But what does the DUP make of it all?
Its leader Arlene Foster recently compared Sinn FÃ©in to a hungry crocodile, but she now finds herself and her party being caricatured as political dinosaurs.
Several memes use Old Testament imagery to mock the party's strongly-held religious views.
The party's stance on moral issues is at odds with the law in the rest of the UK where same-sex marriage is legal.
Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is not legal.
Its abortion law also differs from the rest of the UK - terminations are only allowed if a woman's life is at risk or there is a permanent or serious risk to her physical or mental health.
The DUP is the biggest political party in Northern Ireland and wields considerable influence in both debates.
A recurring theme for political cartoonists is a weakened Theresa May, beholden to a higher-than-mighty DUP, as commentators speculate on the price the prime minister, and the Irish peace process, might pay for the party's support.
Some meme artists have photo-shopped images of biomass boilers being installed in No 10 - a nod to Mrs Foster's role in a green energy scandal that toppled her power-sharing coalition with Sinn FÃ©in earlier this year.
Others have used images of men in balaclavas to suggest a more sinister twist to the negotiations, even though the DUP has repeatedly rejected paramilitary endorsements.
One DUP councillor joined in with the fun and games on Facebook, however, sharing mocked-up photos of Number 10 Downing Street bedecked in loyalist and Northern Ireland flags.
""Few changes made in Downing Street today,"" wrote Ian Stevenson, who is a former DUP mayor of Ballymoney.
However, Mr Stevenson said he removed the post ""immediately"" when it was pointed out to him that the meme included a paramilitary flag, representing the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).
""I never noticed that it was a UVF one. I've no time for them and I don't endorse them,"" he told the Belfast Telegraph.
The DUP was founded in 1971, the year after its 46-year-old leader Arlene Foster was born, but it seems that few outside Northern Ireland were familiar with the party's policies, until last week's baptism of fire.
The party's website crashed last Friday morning, when it became clear the DUP was being courted by Theresa May to play a role in supporting her next government.
The DUP was also one of the most searched terms on Google that day, as a curious world pondered what those letters stand for.
It wasn't long before some fairly old - but still very controversial - headlines began to re-surface, offending and outraging modern sensibilities.
Twitter user Jamie Hogan borrowed a famous painting of 17th Century pilgrims to create an irreverent meme of the DUP's journey to Downing Street.
He told the BBC it was ""just a bit of fun"", but said he wasn't surprised by the backlash against the party.
The Irish steelworker said people in Ireland north and south were long familiar with the DUP's views, but their policies were bound to cause a reaction when brought to the attention of wider European society.
The vilification of the DUP was by no means confined to the satirists.
At the weekend, the Daily Mirror's front-page headline slammed the DUP/Tory deal as a ""coalition of crackpots"".
Another UK national newspaper - the Independent - tweeted a link to a video profile of the party, stating: ""These are the terrifying views of the party now propping up Theresa May.""
Has it all gone too far?
Although the DUP did use a Stormont veto to block same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, it is not alone in opposing abortion.
The Belfast Telegraph said the party has enjoyed a surge in interest but has fallen victim to a ""flood of fake news"".
In an analysis piece for Monday's paper, former BBC journalist and Stormont spin doctor David Gordon said the DUP had ""moved some distance from firebrand pulpit politics towards the centre ground"".
He argued that any deal with the Tories ""will not be about gay marriage or abortion - anyone who thinks otherwise doesn't know the modern-day Conservative Party or, indeed, the DUP"".
One of the DUP's 10 MPs, Gavin Robinson, told the BBC he was ""not surprised"" by the satirical material appearing online about his party in recent days.
But cartoons aside, Mr Robinson refused to be drawn into further comment.
His DUP colleague, Councillor Ian Stevenson, agreed there had been ""some hostile material"" posted online over the past few days but he was philosophical about it.
""That's just the nature of social media,"" Mr Stevenson.
""Some of it has also been very positive.""",The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has become a political force in Northern Ireland.

39708,"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . A mother who claims her software millionaire ex-husband cheated her out of a fair share of his fortune will fight a landmark divorce battle in the Supreme Court. Alison Sharland, 46, accepted £10.35million from AppSense founder Charles Sharland two years ago after their marriage of 17 years broke down. She agreed to the payout thinking it was worth half his fortune - yet his stake in the firm was estimated wildly higher at £150million soon afterwards, London's Court of Appeal heard. Battle: Alison Sharland, 46 (left) accepted £10.35m from her ex-husband Charles (right) in the belief it was half his fortune. But his firm AppSense was later valued wildly higher, and his stake was said to be worth £150m . Ms Sharland tried to secure more money from her ex-husband but her bid was rejected, despite a top judge agreeing he had 'lied' and 'misled' the first hearing. Today Ms Sharland was given the go-ahead to challenge that rejection in Britain's highest court. The Supreme Court, which was founded in 2009 and sits opposite the Houses of Parliament, will consider the case next June because it raises wider issues about the British legal system. Her barrister Patrick Chamberlayne QC told the Court of Appeal: 'She was cheated into an agreement. If someone dupes you into a deal, why should you be held to a deal? 'This was a case of equality. It was a long marriage. All the assets had been acquired during the course of the marriage and each party had made their full contribution. 'Part of the wife’s case was that she was busy making post-separation efforts as well. She had the unusual task of lifelong care of the parties’ disabled child.' Popular: AppSense provides remote access software to  4,000 companies and was said to be worth £460m . The couple married in 1993 and separated in 2010, divorcing two years later. They lived in Wilmslow, Cheshire, and had three children as they built a substantial fortune. Mr Sharland ran his company from a business park in Daresbury, near Warrington, while Mrs Sharland ran an autism charity, the court heard. In July 2012 they agreed a settlement which handed Ms Sharland £10.35million in cash and properties. She would also gain 30 per cent of proceeds from her ex-husband's shares in his company when it was floated on the stock market. Mr Sharland would take less in cash and properties at £5.64million, but retain 70 per cent of his shares in the digital firm when it was floated. The row then ignited over how much Mr Sharland's company was worth. Used by high-end firms including the bank JPMorgan Chase and the airline Lufthansa, AppSense was founded in 1999 and has offices in cities including London, Paris, Amsterdam and Oslo. In the original court action, the firm was valued at between £31.5million and £47.25million while Mr Sharland's shares were said to be worth £7million. But it later emerged the company was said to be worth £460million - putting Mr Sharland's stake at £150million, the court heard. Landmark: Ms Sharland's case will be heard at the Supreme Court, opposite the Houses of Parliament . High Court judge Sir Hugh Bennett refused to 'set aside' the agreement and restart the process, even though he found Mr. Sharland had been 'dishonest' about his wealth. He took the decision because he said it would not have made any substantial difference to the settlement. Charles Sharland founded AppSense in 1999 and it has now grown into one of the biggest firms of its kind in the world. It provides secure remote access software for large companies, so their employees can get onto complex internal systems reliably from their laptops in airports or hotels. The technology is used by more than 4,000 firms including the bank JPMorgan Chase, sports channel ESPN and the airlines United Airlines and Lufthansa. An article in the Wall Street Journal in August 2012 - a month after the Sharlands' divorce settlement - suggested it could be worth as much as $1billion (£613million). But the firm's finances are also secretive and difficult to define for sure. A spokesman told the newspaper at the time: 'The company doesn’t comment on rumour or speculation.' She escalated her fight to the Court of Appeal but it agreed, throwing out Ms Sharland’s case by a two to one majority. She was ordered to pay the appeal's £50,000 legal costs, including those of her ex-husband. That was despite the Court of Appeal saying Mr Sharland's behaviour was 'deplorable' and his deceit had been 'deliberate and dishonest'. Lord Justice Moore-Bick added Mr Sharland 'had lied to the court and misled both the wife and the judge.' Mr Sharland did not deny that he had misled the court, but insisted the settlement reached was a fair one. The Supreme Court case will rest on whether the millionaire's dishonesty made the whole of the original divorce settlement 'unjust'. Ms Sharland's lawyer Ros Bever, of solicitors Irwin Mitchell, said: 'We are very pleased that the Supreme Court has agreed that this is a case which requires consideration at the highest level. 'Dishonesty in any legal proceedings should not be tolerated; the family court should not be an exception. 'There are numerous legal arguments to be had before the Supreme Court but we hope that ultimately justice will be done and will be seen to be done.' Mr Sharland's solicitors, James Brown and Beth Wilkins at JMW LLP, said: 'With the Supreme Court due to consider the details of Mr and Mrs Sharland's divorce, we feel that it would be inappropriate to prejudice those deliberations by taking relevant arguments to the media before they are presented to the Court. 'The fact remains that the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's judgement that the agreement struck between Mr and Mrs Sharland was fair and had not caused her any loss.'","Alison Sharland, 46, accepted £10.35m from her ex-husband Charles two years ago.

53209,"Kohl led Germany for 16 years (from 1982 to 1998). He is credited with bringing East and West Germany together after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Together with his French ally President Francois Mitterrand, he was responsible for the introduction of the euro.
European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has ordered flags at EU institutions to be flown at half-mast.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Kohl's former protegee who later called for his resignation over a political funding scandal, said his death filled her with deep sadness.
""Helmut Kohl's efforts brought about the two greatest achievements in German politics of recent decades - German reunification and European unity,"" she said.
""Helmut Kohl understood that the two things were inseparable.""
For his part, Mr Juncker said in a tweet: ""Helmut's death hurts me deeply."" ""My mentor, my friend, the very essence of Europe, he will be greatly, greatly missed,"" he added.
Former US President George HW Bush paid tribute to the man he knew while in office from 1989 to 1993 as a ""true friend of freedom"" and ""one of the greatest leaders in post-war Europe"".
Kohl suffered a bad fall in 2008 and had been using a wheelchair.
He died at his house in Ludwigshafen, in the western state of Rhineland-Palatinate, Bild newspaper reports.
Kohl, who led the centre-right Christian Democrats, was the longest-serving chancellor of the 20th Century.
A passionate believer in European integration, he persuaded Germans to give up their cherished deutschmark in favour of the European single currency.
In the UK, he is remembered for his differences over the EU with the late UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
In France, he is the German leader who held hands with Mitterrand at a service at the Verdun war memorial in 1984 to mark the 70th anniversary of World War One.
But for Germans he is above all the man who reunified a country divided by the allied powers after World War Two, promising the people of the ex-communist East ""flourishing landscapes"", in unity with the richer West.
Helmut Josef Michael Kohl was born on 3 April 1930 into a conservative, Catholic family.
His political outlook was shaped by his experiences in his hometown of Ludwigshafen in the Rhineland during World War Two.
Because of its huge chemical works, the town was heavily bombed and, at the age of 12, the young Helmut found himself helping to recover the charred bodies of his neighbours from the rubble. What he once described as ""the blessing of a late birth"" freed him from any taints of Nazism.

3641,"By . Jack Doyle . Mass spying claims made by Edward Snowden were rejected last night by a surveillance watchdog. Documents stolen by the rogue US agent led to reports in the Guardian as well as US newspapers that the secret services were snooping on millions of ordinary citizens. But in a report yesterday, Sir Anthony May ruled that MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, were not engaged in ‘mass intrusion’. Exile: Edward Snowden speaking during a presentation ceremony in Moscow last year. Today a communications watchdog ruled the intelligence services were not involved in 'mass intrusion' However the Interception of Communications Commissioner did raise fears that the police were engaged in the ‘institutional overuse’ of surveillance powers. Constabularies carried out more than half a million electronic spying missions last year, the equivalent of more than 1,400 a day, his review said. Sir Anthony said he was concerned that police and the National Crime Agency were failing to consider privacy issues. By contrast, the former high court judge gave the three intelligence and security agencies a clean bill of health following a wide-ranging review of their activities. He said they did not ‘misuse’ the powers given to them by Parliament to engage in ‘random mass intrusion in to the private lives of law abiding citizens’. Such acts are not permitted by law and would be ‘comprehensively unlawful’, he added. Speech: Yesterday, the rogue agent joined a discussion via video-link, about the US government's use of mass surveillance during a parliamentary session in Strasbourg . The public should be reassured that unless they ‘associate with potential terrorists or serious criminals ... none of the interception agencies has the slightest interest in examining their emails, their phone or postal communications or their use of the internet’, he said. Sir Anthony also rejected allegations that spying agencies were ‘getting around the law’ by receiving intercepted communications about British citizens indirectly from US spy agencies. Judgement: Sir Anthony May, the Interception of Communications Commissioner, ruled that MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, were not engaged in 'mass intrusion' Even when large amounts of material were collected by agencies, GCHQ was not permitted to  trawl through it indiscriminately,  he found. Senior intelligence figures have criticised the publication of Snowden’s stolen files. The head of MI5, Andrew Parker, said the publication of the top secret material had caused huge ‘harm’ to the capability of Britain’s intelligence services and amounted to a ‘gift’ to terrorists. Whitehall officials say it is considered to have caused the greatest damage to the Western security apparatus in history. Snowden, a former contractor with the US National Security Agency, stole tens of thousands of restricted files and leaked them to the Guardian and the Washington Post. He sought refuge in Russia where he was granted temporary asylum last summer. Home Secretary Theresa May said the report ‘makes clear the intelligence agencies, law enforcement agencies and other public authorities operate lawfully, conscientiously and in the national interest’. Foreign Secretary William Hague, who has responsibility for GCHQ, said: ‘A senior and fully independent judge has looked in detail at whether the interception agencies misuse their powers to engage in random mass intrusion. He has concluded that the answer is emphatically no.’ Sir Anthony criticised the police’s use of communications data – which can show where users are sending emails and who they are calling, but not the content of any messages. He said the ‘very large number’ of 514,608 requests in 2013 showed officers may be using their powers as an automatic resort rather than worrying about privacy.","Documents stolen by rogue US agent led to reports in the Guardian.

31446,"The far-right National Democratic Party (NPD) poster is certainly eye-catching - sinister, black-clad ""rapefugees"" juxtaposed with the rear view of a shapely, nearly naked white woman.
But nearby, in plain black and blue, there is a less visual but equally arresting message.
To those interested in mass immigration, criminality and pension security, it declares, vote AfD on Sunday ""so that Germany is not destroyed"".
AfD refers to Alternative for Germany, and is a populist, Eurosceptic party, founded just three years ago and already the country's fastest-growing political movement.
If the latest polls are anything to go by, the AfD is, for the first time, ahead of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) here in her home state, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania.
With the CDU also losing support in Berlin, which holds elections later this month, September could represent a significant milestone in Mrs Merkel's long political journey, as she ponders running for a remarkable fourth term as chancellor next year.
In this largely rural state, commonly known as ""MeckPomm"", strident messages about immigration might seem a little hollow.
The state has taken in around 26,000 migrants since the current wave began in 2015. It is a small proportion of the estimated one million who arrived last year. Under a federal allocation system, Mecklenburg is expected to take in just 2.03% of all refugees.
But this region of the former East Germany is also poor and thinly populated.
Anti-immigrant rhetoric resonates. It is key to the AfD's success, a theme relentlessly highlighted in campaign literature and meetings with voters.
At an AfD campaign stop in Grosse Klein, a poor suburb of Rostock with a higher than average concentration of immigrants, the subject of foreigners, particularly Muslims, dominated.
""They don't fit here at all,"" party supporter Hannelore Schroter told me.
""When I see these women in public, completely covered, I think they shouldn't be here in Germany.""
At its party congress, earlier this year, the AfD declared that ""Islam is not a part of Germany"", and called for bans on burkas (full-body veils), minarets and the call to prayer.
""It's very difficult to integrate Muslims. People from a strange culture,"" party spokesman Roger Schmidt told me.
For some, the very name Rostock is synonymous with hostility to outsiders.
In 1992, the suburb of Lichtenhagen saw Germany's worst post-war anti-immigrant riots. Petrol bombs were hurled at apartment blocks housing asylum seekers, while thousands of local residents stood by and cheered.
Twenty-four years later, in Rostock's elegant city centre, the chilling sounds from that episode played from loudspeakers, as local activists commemorated one of the city's darkest hours. This, they warned, must not be allowed to happen again.
In recent weeks, popular protests in Grosse Klein forced the city to remove 15 migrant boys from a youth centre and cancel plans to build a new refugee shelter.
There is no suggestion the AfD was involved in the protests, but Martin Koschkar, a political scientist at Rostock University, says the party is making effective use of the current climate.
""The AfD benefits from this polarised debate,"" he told me.
Two terror attacks in July involving refugees have heightened security concerns across Germany. But Mr Koschkar says an underlying dissatisfaction with politicians is also helping to fuel the party's rise.
""They're mixing the migration topic with general criticism of the older parties.""
Sunday's election in MeckPomm coincides with the first anniversary of the day, a year ago, when Angela Merkel decided to bring thousands of migrants to Germany on trains.
Coupled with her ""we can do it"" announcement, a few days earlier, it marked a turning point in Mrs Merkel's political fortunes. The rise of the AfD is just one of many consequences.","As the German election draws nearer, the image of a rape victim in a crowded street is a stark contrast."
59529,"Celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz could lose the right to her entire portfolio of world-famous photographs if she doesn't meet a Tuesday deadline to pay back a $24 million loan she is alleged to owe. Annie Leibovitz appears before her photo of Demi Moore during an exhibition of her work in June in Madrid, Spain. Leibovitz, who has photographed everyone from the Rolling Stones to Queen Elizabeth II, put her art, intellectual property and even real estate assets up for collateral last year when she consolidated her massive debts. Art Capital Group, which restructured the debts, says Leibovitz agreed ""to make Art Capital her 'irrevocable exclusive agent'"" of the assets ""in exchange for a reduced interest rate on the loan."" Now the company is suing Leibovitz for breach of contract, saying she has ""refused to cooperate in the sale of those assets,"" according to a question-and-answer sheet on the lawsuit issued by Art Capital. It also says she has ""refused to pay to Art Capital hundreds of thousands of dollars she owed as part of the same agreement."" Asked by CNN for comment, Leibovitz's attorney, Steven Brawer, said, ""I don't have anything I can tell you."" They have until October 1 to respond to the lawsuit. In the question-and-answer sheet, Art Capital says Leibovitz ""acknowledged that in order to repay the loan she would sell her fine art, intellectual property and real estate assets. She authorized Art Capital to act as agent in the sale of those assets through which Art Capital could recoup its decrease in interest rate. She would have realized a significant gain from that sale."" It says the loan agreement gave Art Capital ""the right to sell the collateral before the loan came due on September 8 and for a two-year period thereafter."" One of Leibovitz's best known photos is of John Lennon with his wife, Yoko Ono, shortly before the Beatles star was assassinated in 1980. She is no stranger to controversy. In 1991, Leibovitz photographed a nude and extremely pregnant Demi Moore for the cover of Vanity Fair. The issue, considered scandalous at the time, was sold in many places nationwide with a sheath of white paper. Last year, Leibovitz photographed Disney star Miley Cyrus wrapped in a bedsheet, eliciting claims that the photographer pressured the teen queen into poses that were too provocative for her young age. In July, Art Capital filed a complaint with the New York Supreme Court, asking it to uphold the sales agreement it signed with Leibovitz, including its right to sell her art and real estate. If the court agrees with Art Capital, it means Leibovitz could end up owing far more than she did originally. Art Capital has asked for an unspecified amount of damages in addition to the money it says the photographer originally borrowed. Art Capital","Annie Leibovitz is alleged to owe $24 million in loans.

The corporation has also had 83 iPads, 109 mobile phones, 34 desktop computers and 98 cameras taken in the same five-year period, it has been revealed. It comes after staff complained the BBC's £1bn New Broadcasting House in central London was 'swarming with petty thieves' who stole everything from bananas and sandwiches to trousers. Gone: More than 620 laptops have been stolen from the BBC and its staff in the last five years, figures reveal just days after it emerged staff at New Broadcasting House (above) said it was 'swarming with petty thieves' Among the more unusual thefts between 2010 and 2014 were four kettles and two fire-extinguishers. Even a sign telling staff not to steal toilet paper was taken from a toilet by a thief earlier this month. The new figures were obtained from the BBC in a Freedom of Information Act request by the Parliament Street think-tank. Its director, Clare George-Hilley, said: 'These findings show that the BBC must do more to prevent theft and losses at every level of the organisation, taxpayers should not have to pick up the bill for sloppy management of expensive equipment. 'To tackle this, the organisation needs to deliver more effective policies and training to ensure staff understand the importance of looking after devices.'

The new information also reveals that Broadcasting House staff have reported theft of food and items of clothing. The BBC said in a statement last night: 'With thousands of staff and people coming and going in more than 150 BBC buildings at any one time, it is regrettably inevitable personal property and other items occasionally go missing. 'The BBC takes such incidents seriously and has implemented a number of crime prevention measures.'

The US fired 59 missiles at a Syrian airbase after the alleged attack.
Syria has denied using any chemical agents, and Russia says the US gave no evidence Syria has chemical weapons.

Syria 'chemical attack': What we know
Why was Syria's Shayrat airbase bombed?
Speaking on CBS's Face The Nation, Mr Tillerson said there was no evidence to suggest Russia was part of the alleged chemical attack.
However, ""whether Russia was complicit here or whether they were simply incompetent or whether they got outwitted"" by the Syrian government, they had ""failed in their commitment to the international community"", he said.
Russia had agreed to ""be the guarantor of the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles... the result of their failure has led to the killing of more children and innocents,"" Mr Tillerson added.
Mr Tillerson is set to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, this week in Moscow.

Western governments, rebel leaders and a weapons expert all criticised this claim, saying the evidence pointed to an attack by the Syrian government.
Following the suspected attack, US President Donald Trump launched air strikes against a Syrian government air base, and branded Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad a ""dictator"" who had ""launched a horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians"".

50612,"It was Hearts who were first reduced to 10 men when Igor Rossi was sent off just before half-time.
He saw red for a two-footed tackle, while another heavy foul saw Hamilton's Jesus Garcia Tena dismissed in the second-half.
Hamilton will have valued the point, though, with Hearts hitting the woodwork three times.
The game began as a test of Hamilton's character, since the players could still have been emotionally bruised by their 8-1 loss to Celtic in midweek.
There was a natural retreat into being briskly and forcefully competitive. Martin Canning sent his side out in a 3-4-3 shape, to ensure there was cover in defence against Hearts' front two, but formation was secondary to attitude.
Pressure was applied swiftly and vigorously to any Hearts player on the ball and the opening half seldom raised itself above a general level of scrappy endeavour. Darian MacKinnon and Mickey Devlin also clattered into a couple of strong challenges that left opponents grounded.
Hearts sought to be progressive, but tended to be constrained. Even so, Rossi hit the post with a header and when Callum Paterson pounced on the rebound his effort was saved by the Hamilton goalkeeper Michael McGovern.
Chances were rare, and Hearts' best moment quickly descended into their worst. Billy King was still wondering how McGovern reached out an arm to push away his half-volley when Rossi launched a two-footed tackle on Darren Lyon that sparked a furious response from the Hamilton players.
Once the melee subsided, the referee Bobby Madden sent Rossi off and booked some of the agitators. The referee was shrewd and decisive throughout, and handled an occasionally feisty game with a sure sense of control.
Hearts regrouped during the interval, while Hamilton tried to shift their mindset from containment to creativity. They were helped in that regard by the range of passing and imagination of Ali Crawford, who grew in influence.
Their best opportunity came when Tena's shot was blocked by Paterson, then Devlin's header was saved by the Hearts goalkeeper Neil Alexander.
Hearts were initially cautious, hoping to hit on the break, but even before Hamilton were reduced to 10 men the visitors had grown in stature. From Alim Ozturk's cross, Blazej Augustyn hit the crossbar with a firm header.
Although the niggly nature of the game had dissipated, a flashpoint was still possible. It came when Tena heavily fouled the impressive Arnaud Djoum, leading to a straight red card. As Hamilton tried to adapt, Jordan McGhee's header across goal was met by Dario Zanatta, but his header hit the bar.
For all their industry, Hamilton still needed a moment of resolve from McGovern, when the goalkeeper had to keep the final touch of the game - a Juanma stubbed shot - out at close-range.",Hamilton's hopes of a first win of the season were shattered as they fought back from a goal down to draw with Hearts.

78686,"The 168th Manchester derby is looming on Sunday and the match has gained added importance for Manuel Pellegrini’s men. By their high standards, Manchester City have slipped into slumber over the last three games with two losses and a draw characterised by unimaginative, jaded displays from their most important players. A 2-0 defeat at the hands of Newcastle United to send them out of the League Cup alone would have been enough to cast a shadow over Pellegrini’s week, but it followed a lacklustre Premier League defeat at West Ham and a stuttering Champions League stalemate with CSKA Moscow. Manuel Pellegrini has plenty of issues to address if Manchester City are to recover their form this season . City's players trudge off dejected after their 2-0 home loss to Newcastle United in the Capital One Cup . City find themselves six points behind leaders Chelsea ahead of the weekend's Premier League action . Striker Edin Dzeko looks dejected after seeing City's defence of the Capital One Cup come to an early end . It is fair to say the Chilean is in the midst of the most trying week of his City career so far, with City in danger of going out of the Champions League and at risk of repeating their doomed title defence of 2012-13. He must arrest the slide on Sunday if they are to keep Chelsea in their sights. Here are five items in Pellegrini's in-tray at the moment. The defence is still a cause for concern . Pellegrini said the team had been working on its defence before the Newcastle game but there was scant evidence of that as Alan Pardew’s side, largely without the world class talent of City, were allowed too much time and space to make their breakthroughs. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce fired the warning shots at the weekend when he pinpointed City new boy Eliaquim Mangala as one of the weaknesses his side exploited last week. Eliaquim Mangala was unable to stop Newcastle's Rolando Aarons scoring their opening goal on Wednesday . Pellegrini believes Mangala has been a scapegoat like Martin Demichelis (right) was last season . City line up to defend a Ryan Taylor free-kick during Wednesday night's match at the Etihad . The 23-year-old, bought for £32m in the summer, has failed to justify his price tag so far but Pellegrini suggested he was being scapegoated in the same way as Martin Demichelis was last year. The City manager will hope Mangala can emulate the Argentine by turning his career at the Etihad around in a similar fashion. Injuries are in danger of derailing progress . Pellegrini’s decision to field a strong starting XI in the League Cup, the competition which gave him his first silverware in England, is laudable. But the sight of playmaker David Silva limping off after eight minutes, with a derby four days away, suggested it had perhaps been ill advised. The Spaniard is a vital cog in the City side and a game changing talent. City suffered another blow when playmaker David Silva limped off after just eight minutes . Silva's injury presents another headache for Pellegrini ahead of Sunday's clash with United . Pellegrini might have been better off resting him in midweek, having played against West Ham just four days previously. City will receive news about Silva’s knee injury on Thursday and will be hoping for a positive report. Yaya Toure also exited lamely after an hour last night with a groin strain, although Pellegrini said that was merely precautionary. City are a team struggling for confidence . The current run of results - draw-loss-loss - would not be viewed as a mini crisis at most other clubs but this is is a side that has become accustomed to victory. They have won just six of 15 games in all competitions this season and are now on a three-match winless run for the second time in a season that is less than three months old. Pellegrini conceded that his players were low on confidence and suffering from a ‘lack of trust’. With the defence leaking goals and attacking players not capitalising on chances, the confidence problem will only intensify if they fail to get a result against United. Sergio Aguero looks crest-fallen after referee Stuart Attwell shows him a yellow card . James Milner bellows instructions to his team-mates during the Newcastle game . Joe Hart fails to keep out Diafra Sakho's header in City's 2-1 loss at Manchester City last Saturday . The City defence react as CSKA Moscow are awarded a penalty in last week's Champions League tie . Just what has happened to Yaya Toure? Last season he was the driving force at the Etihad, dominating with his trademark runs down the centre of the pitch and leading by example. There have been glimpses of his greatness this season, too, but he has been largely ineffectual, lacking sharpness, being outmuscled by his opponents and occasionally looking disinterested. He has scored only one goal - an impressive strike against Aston Villa and even then he was poor for the rest of the game. If he doesn't start improving soon he'll be lucky to get a birthday card, never mind a cake from City. Yaya Toure grimaces as he leaves the field after an hour of the match with Newcastle . City are growing a reputation for being a lousy cup team . Manchester City have a proud and rich history in the cups, with their first FA Cup trophy dating back to 1904. They have had success recently, too, winning the FA Cup in 2011, the Community Shield in 2012 and lifting the League Cup earlier this year. Pellegrini clearly values them, too, consistently fielding strong teams. But for some reason, they just can’t find their feet this season. Including the Community Shield, they have one just one of six cup games and that was against Championship side Sheffield Wednesday. Pellegrini has inspired City to reverse their form before, encouraging his side to magnificently catch and overhaul Liverpool in last season’s title race. His side showed real character and focus to hunt down Liverpool and secure the title on the final day of the season, meaning he had a League-cup double to show for his first season in charge.

Celebrity names dotted the listâ€”Gloria Steinem, Nora Ephron, Lillian Hellman and Billie Jean King among them.

66254,"By . Paul Donnelley . A husband has been found guilty of murdering his estranged wife following the collapse of their 27-year marriage. Christopher Parry, 50, gunned down Caroline, 46, in a quiet suburban street in south Wales last year. Weeks before, Mrs Parry had moved out of the marital home, fed up with her husband’s controlling and domineering ways. Newport Crown Court heard jealous Parry turned up at her new address unannounced – armed with a semi-automatic gun containing three bullets. Face of a murderer: Christopher Parry, 49, shot himself in the face in a suicide attempt after he killed his wife . After shooting her twice in the back, he turned the gun on himself and unleashed a shot into his face at point -blank range. Parry, who has permanent facial disfigurement from the botched suicide attempt, admitted causing the death of his wife, but denied murder. However, a jury cast aside claims the depressed defendant was not in control of his actions - and ruled the killing was intentional. Despite announcing that their relationship was over, Christopher Parry continued to stalk estranged wife Caroline (above) and finally snapped and killed her . The shooting took place in Seabreeze Avenue, Newport, South Wales, on August 8. Mrs Parry had been living in the newly-built red-brick estate after moving out of the home she shared with her husband six miles away in Croesyceiliog, near Cwmbran. But despite being told on April 12 their relationship was over, Parry refused to accept this - and was convinced she still had feelings for him. A jury heard the defendant kept his wife ‘under surveillance’ and was described by prosecuting counsel Michael Mather-Lees QC as a man ‘not prepared to let go’. Armed police at the scene in Newport, South Wales, where Christopher Parry shot and killed his wife before turning the gun on himself . In the weeks leading up to tragedy, he repeatedly texted, phoned and followed his wife. The day prior to the shooting, licensed gun-holder Parry booked two days off work. And on that fateful day, Mrs Parry was leaving for work when something caused her to stop and open the boot of her red Toyota car. It was then her estranged husband got out of his Ford Focus and retrieved his firearm from the back of his vehicle. After pulling the trigger three times, neighbours found the couple’s bloodied bodies lying side-by-side on the road. Mrs Parry was pronounced dead at the Royal Gwent Hospital. Forensic staff examine Mrs Parry's red Toyota car after she was shot by her estranged husband .

57294,"His comments came as the BBC published for the first time the pay of stars earning Â£150,000 and more.
The figures reveal that about two-thirds of stars earning more than Â£150,000 are male, compared to one-third female, according to the BBC annual report.
The top seven earners in the list of the BBC's 96 best-paid stars are all male.
The pay gap is the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women.
Across the UK men earned 18.1% more than women in April 2016 according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This figure is calculated on a 1% sample of employees' jobs. It takes the median for men and women, which is the figure at the mid-point of the range of earnings.
The pay gap isn't the same as equal pay. Equal pay - that men and women doing the same job should be paid the same - has been a legal requirement for 47 years.
As the following graph shows, the gap between men and women's earning for both full and part-time work has fallen from 27.5% in 1997 to 18.1% in 2016. If you only look at full-time workers the pay gap drops to 9.4%. For part-time workers the pay gap favours women, who now earn 6% more than men.
The numbers do not tell the whole story.
The list does not distinguish between people who are paid for doing multiple jobs within the BBC and those who are paid for just one.
The figures only include what the BBC pays its talent directly. So if a presenter is paid by an independent production company or by the BBC's commercial arm, this is not included.
Questioned by Mishal Husain on Radio 4's Today programme, director general Lord Hall said that, compared with an 18% gap in pay between genders across the UK, the BBC pay gap across the corporation was 10%, which will be audited in the autumn.
The BBC press office said that covered full and part-time employees. Reality Check asked for the part-time figures but the press office said that was all it had in terms of breakdown at the moment.
The ONS provides some pay gap data for groups of occupations based on their annual earnings survey.
The following graph shows the gender pay gap by major occupation groups.
According to ONS definitions, elementary occupations require ""a minimum general level of education"". This category includes farm and postal workers, cleaners and security guards.
Skilled trades include jobs requiring a ""substantial period of training"", such as landscape gardeners, vehicle mechanics and TV engineers.
Associate professionals and technical occupations include jobs such as civil engineers technicians, paramedics and youth workers.
It is possible to look at jobs within these broad groups. For instance, the pay gap for the category ""journalists, newspaper and periodical editors"", which includes broadcast journalists, is 7.1%.
Likewise, for ""artistic, media and literary occupations"", which includes presenters, actors, producers and directors but also professions such as dancers and choreographers, the gap is just 2.7%.
Another way to look at the pay gap is by industry sector rather than by occupation. This shows that for the programming and broadcasting sector, looking at employees' hourly pay, the gender pay gap is 9.4%.
The 10% figure quoted by Lord Hall covers everyone employed by the BBC, so will include a wide range of jobs including technical staff, journalists, human resources and marketing.
By April 2018, all companies with 250 or more employees will have to publish figures showing average pay for men and women including any bonuses. This will reveal how widespread the gender pay gap is and will enable comparisons with other companies.
Meanwhile, Lord Hall has made a commitment to closing the pay gap in the BBC altogether. ""I have said that by 2020 we will have equality between men and women on air and we will have the pay gap sorted out.""

86770,"The FBI has seized a two-page, handwritten letter of condolence sent by Jacqueline Kennedy to the widow of Robert F. Kennedy shortly after he was assassinated in 1968. The family contends the letter was stolen. Jacqueline Kennedy sent her sister-in-law a condolence letter in 1968 which is now in the hands of the FBI. ""We're trying to determine who the legal owner is,"" said Mark White, a spokesman for the FBI. ""There's still an ongoing investigation."" The letter's path from the Virginia home of Robert Kennedy's widow, Ethel Kennedy, to a locked evidence vault in the Dallas field office of the FBI is described in a six-page affidavit filed last month in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas by Special Agent John Skillestad. It says Max Kennedy, the son of Ethel and Robert, alerted the bureau in July 2006 to the letter's pending auction at Heritage Galleries and Auctioneers Galleries in Dallas. Max Kennedy, who said he is the sole person in charge of his parents' papers, ""stated that he had not given authority to sell, give, or donate any papers of Ethel or Robert Kennedy to anyone,"" the affidavit says. After the gallery pulled the letter from its auction, the FBI traced its provenance to Thomas Nuckols, who told authorities he had found it among the papers left by his father, Russell Thomas Nuckols, a plumber who died in 1999. ""Thomas Nuckols said he was dumbfounded upon discovery of the letter because he had never seen it before and did not know how it came into his father's possession,"" the affidavit says. Nuckols said he contacted the Kennedy Library in Boston, Massachusetts, but ""the person on the telephone did not seem too interested in the letter"" and referred him to a Connecticut collector, who bought it for $6,000, the affidavit says. CNN has not been able to reach Nuckols. The letter was then resold to several other collectors, and was at one time valued at as much as $30,000 before it wound up with the Dallas auctioneer, who has cooperated with authorities, the FBI said. Last October, the FBI spoke with Ethel Kennedy, who said she remembers Russell Thomas Nuckols as a plumber who worked at the Kennedy house in Virginia during the 1960s and 1970s, the affidavit says. The 81-year-old widow of the former senator and attorney general said she ""never gave the letter to anyone to keep and under no circumstances would anyone have the authority to transfer ownership of the letter to anyone."" The affidavit concludes that the letter ""is considered as a stolen good."" Once the rightful owner is determined, it will be given to that person, FBI spokesman White said. ""I don't know how long it will take."" Jacqueline Kennedy was the widow of President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1963. In the letter she mentions ""Stas,"" an apparent reference to Stanislas Radziwill, her brother-in-law. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis died in 1994. The letter is not dated, but appears to have been written shortly after Robert Kennedy died on June 6, 1968, the victim of an assassin's bullet. The Dallas News printed a copy of the letter, which White confirmed is authentic. It reads: . My Ethel",FBI trying to determine who owns letter. Family contends it was stolen.

12670,"Thirty per cent of online posts which are deemed inappropriate on China's equivalent of Twitter are deleted within half an hour, according to new research. Computer scientists Jed Crandall and Dan Wallach conducted the study on how quickly censorship on Sina Weibo can work. They found that some posts are deleted as quickly as five minutes after being put online. Censorship: Computer scientists Jed Crandall and Dan Wallach found that some posts are deleted after five minutes of being posted . Microblogging site Sina Weibo launched in 2010 but it now has 300 million users. About 100 million messages are sent daily. But the Chinese government seems to ask Chinese companies to censor posts. Support Syrian rebels . Lying of gov (Jixian) Beijing rainstorms . Judicial independence . Freedom of speech . One-Child policy abuse . Group sex . Corpse plants in Dalian . Human Rights news . The researchers said: 'We found that deletions happen most heavily in the first hour after a post has been submitted. 'Focusing on original posts, not reposts/retweets, we observed that nearly 30 per cent of the total deletion events occur within five to 30 minutes. 'Nearly 90 per cent of the deletions happen within the first 24 hours. 'Leveraging out data, we also consider a variety of hypotheses about the mechanisms used by Weibo for censorship, such as the extent to which they use retrospective keyword-based censorship, and how repost/retweet popularity interacts with censorship. 'We also perform a topical analysis of the deleted posts, overcoming the usage of neologisms, named entities, and informal language that typifies Chinese social media.' Crandall and Wallach spent 30 days tracking posts by 3,500 users on Sina Weibo. During that time, 300 of the accounts, or 12 percent of the total, were deleted. Accounts that got censored the most often also had posts censored the most quickly, showing that they might be the target of more scrutiny. Though they could not estimate the exact number of people dedicated to deleting posts on Sina Weibo, the two computer scientists said that the company would need to employ at least 4,000 censors every day if none of the process was automated. In December last year the ruling Communist arty, led Xi Jinping, announced moves to force internet users to fully identify themselves to service providers, raising fresh concerns about freedom of speech in the country. It's draconian internet censorship system has been dubbed the 'Great Firewall of China'. China already heavily restricts access to many foreign sites. It blocks Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and many other websites citing a need to maintain social stability.","Computer scientists Jed Crandall and Dan Wallach spent 30 days tracking posts by 3,500 users on Sina Weibo.

92340,"By . Harriet Arkell . Forty-somethings who can't afford to rent or buy a home on their own are turning to flatshares with people half their age, new figures reveal. The combination of divorce and rising house prices are said to be to blame for a massive rise in middle-aged people looking to rent rooms in a Friends-style house full of strangers. Websites for would-be flat-sharers say the number of people aged 40-plus looking for rooms has surged in the last five years, with one reporting a doubling of enquiries from over-40s since 2009. Friends: A decade ago, the US sitcom portrayed 20-somethings sharing, but now the over-40s are doing it, too . Matt Hutchinson, of Spareroom.co.uk, said: 'One in eight wanted ads on our website comes from the over-40s, which equates to 60,000 people that age looking for rooms in the past year. 'That figure has gone up from 40,000 five years ago, representing a 50 per cent increase.' He said: 'The reasons for them wanting to share a room is split between those whose relationships have broken down and those who can't afford to get onto the property ladder. 'Our society is geared towards couples - it is the same price to rent or buy a one-bedroom flat for a couple or a person on their own, so for someone newly-single in their 40s, it is very difficult to afford to live on their own.' Given that the average age of people using his site is 28, it means the older flat-sharers may end up living with people half their age. Mr Hutchinson said that while the number of advertisements posted by 40-somethings had soared, he believed the true figure of those looking to share accommodation was far higher. He said: 'Some 40-somethings are too embarrassed to post an ad, fearing their age might put potential flat-mates off. 'Instead, they just respond to ads, hoping that once they've met the younger flat-mates, they will see that they will all get on.' House prices are rising, so now even the middle-aged are finding it hard to get onto the property ladder . Rishi Patel, of Easyroommate.co.uk, said his website had also noticed more middle-aged people flat-sharing. He said: 'We've noticed a growing number of people in their 40s and older choosing to flat-share, and the number of 40-plus renters registered with us now accounts for 13 per cent of the total number of people searching for a room.' He said marriage break-ups and financial constraints were a factor, but said they also attributed it to older renters having to work in London while their family live outside the capital. 'Nearly a quarter of all our 40-plus flat-sharers are searching for a room in London where they work during the week, and they then go back and spend the weekends with their families' he said. Mr Patel said the current average flat-share rent across the UK was £390, while the average rent was £745. He said: 'The vast different in asking prices clearly shows why growing numbers of people are choosing to flatshare instead of live alone.' Mr Patel said that as long as property prices - to buy or to rent - continue to increase, he predicts that flatsharing will continue to grow in popularity.","More than 60,000 people aged 40-plus looking to share rooms in last year. Average age of people using site is 28 and over-40s make up 13% of search. Divorce and rising house prices blamed for huge rise in middle-aged."

53545,"By . Mail Today Reporter . UPDATED: . 15:28 EST, 11 February 2012 . More cracks have been discovered in the wings of the world's biggest passenger jetliner but Airbus has insisted the aircraft are still safe to fly. The damage has been found in two more A380 superjumbos, just two weeks after tiny cracks were first reported in the wings of the 525-seat, double-decker aircraft, which entered service just over four years ago. The initial discovery led to Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association last week called for the aircraft to be grounded amidst safety concerns. Safety concerns: More cracks have been discovered in the wings of the world's biggest jetliner, the 525-seat, double-decker A380 superjumbo, but Airbus has insisted the aircraft are still safe to fly . 'Airbus confirms that some additional cracks have been found on a limited number of non-critical brackets ... inside the wings of some A380s,' the planemaker said in a statement. 'Airbus emphasizes that these cracks do not affect the safe operation of the aircraft.' The European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA) confirmed it would issue a bulletin Friday mandating precautionary checks. The latest cracking problem was discovered in two aircraft during a routine two-year inspection, an Airbus spokeswoman said. EADS subsidiary Airbus has so far delivered 68 superjumbos, starting with Singapore Airlines which took the first aircraft in December 2007, followed by Dubai's Emirates and Qantas Airways of Australia. Other operators include Air France, Germany's Lufthansa, Korean Air and China Southern. A380 breakdown . So big that many airports had to modify their facilities to accomodate it, the A380 was designed to challenge Boeing's monopoly of the large passenger aircraft market. The aircraft's upper deck extends along the entire length of the fuselage, allowing for a cabin space of 5,145 sq ft - some 49 per cent more than Boeing's 747, the next largest passenger jet currently in service. The A380 is designed for a range of up to 9,600 miles (15,400km), enough to fly from New York to Hong Kong, at a cruising speed of Mach 0.85 (560mph or 900km/h). However, since the first deliveries of the aircraft in 2007, the planes have already been plagued with a series of problems. A blowout in the superjumbos' Derby-built Rolls Royce Trent 900 engines led to an emergency landing of a Qantas A380 in November 2010. Qantas grounded its Airbus fleet for more than a fortnight after the midair explosion over Singapore, which was found to have been caused by a faulty pipe. Rolls subsequently admitted dealing with the fault, including replacing the engines on several aircraft, had cost it £56million. Even the A380's massive size has posed difficulties. Last June an Airbus 380 lost its wing-tip in a taxiing collision with a building at Le Bourget airport Paris. The collision mirrored an incident at JFK airport earlier that year when a private jet was spun round after it was hit by the wing of an A380. The latest problems were discovered in the same type of part as the earlier set of cracks, an L-shaped bracket which connects the wing's exterior to the internal 'rib' structure. A380 wings are manufactured in Broughton, north Wales, and Filton, near Bristol, before they are shipped to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, for final assembly. Each aircraft is powered by four Rolls Royce Trent 900 engines, built in Derby. In total, some 20,000 British workers' jobs rely on the construction of the mammoth planes. Industry journal Air Transport Intelligence said the brackets, known as rib feet, had been stressed during the manufacturing process and that this was being fixed. The A380 has enough room on its wings to park 70 cars and a wingspan of 79.8m (261ft 10in).","Two more cracks found in the wings of the 525-seat, double-decker aircraft.

48402,"The European Medicines Agency gave a positive scientific opinion after assessing its safety and effectiveness.
It represents a 'green light' for the Mosquirix jab, developed by GlaxoSmithKline.
The World Health Organization will consider later this year whether to recommend it for children, among whom trials have yielded mixed results.
Malaria kills around 584,000 people a year worldwide, most of them children under five in sub-Saharan Africa.
Mosquirix, otherwise known as the RTS,S vaccine, is the first against a parasitic infection in humans.
Dr Ripley Ballou, head of research at GSK vaccines, said: ""This is a hugely significant moment.  I've been working on this vaccine for 30 years and this is a dream come true.""
The company has not revealed the price of the vaccine, but has pledged not to make a profit from it.
It has been designed specifically to combat malaria infection in children in Africa and will not be licensed for travellers.
Earlier this year, final results of a clinical trial in seven African countries yielded mixed results.
The best protection was among children aged five to 17 months who received three doses of the vaccine a month apart, plus a booster dose at 20 months.
In this group, cases of severe malaria were cut by a third over four years.
But the effectiveness of the vaccine waned over time, making the booster shot essential.
Without a booster the vaccine did not cut the rate of severe malaria over the trial period.
And disappointingly, the jab did not prove very effective in protecting young babies from severe malaria.
This presents a dilemma for the WHO, which will decide in October whether the vaccine should be deployed,  because it is not nearly as effective as scientists would have hoped.
Furthermore, it had been hoped the jab could be administered at six, 10 and 14 weeks, along with other childhood vaccines.
But the results suggest the jabs need to be started later, which would involve a huge amount of organisation and extra cost as it is outside the childhood vaccine schedule.
Furthermore, the trial results show it is crucial that children receive all four doses of the jab in order to benefit.
But even a partially effective malaria vaccine could have a role to play in countries with very high rates of disease.
GSK began research on a malaria vaccine 30 years ago and the first trials in Africa began in 1998.
In 2001 a partnership was established between GSK and the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative, through a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, with the aim of accelerating development of malaria vaccines.
In 2009 11 centres began recruiting 16,000 children in seven sub-Saharan African countries:  Burkina Faso, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania.
Steve Davis, president and CEO of PATH, said: ""Today marks a significant scientific milestone for the long-standing partnership to develop a vaccine, yet several more steps remain before a malaria vaccine might reach the young children in Africa who most need protection against this deadly human parasite.""
The vaccine works by triggering the immune system to defend against the first stages of infection by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite after it enters the bloodstream following a mosquito bite.
Prof Adrian Hill of the Jenner Institute, Oxford, said he was pleased and encouraged by the EMA's decision but added that the vaccine was not a ""magic bullet"".
He said: ""A bed net is more effective than this vaccine, but nonetheless it is a very significant scientific achievement.
""I see it as a building block towards much more effective malaria vaccines in years to come.""",A malaria vaccine has been approved by the European Medicines Agency for use in children in Africa.
13025,"There is every chance that most people will hate it, but this Easter will see the launch of a Marmite chocolate egg. The egg is being launched alongside an equally unlikely Pot Noodle version by food giant Unilever, which argues they will ‘broaden the appeal of Easter’. The idea of mixing the savoury and salty taste of Marmite with the sweetness of chocolate is not the first flavour combination that would spring to mind – even for the likes of chemistry set chefs like Heston Blumenthal. Scroll down for video . Love it or hate it? Marmite and Pot Noodle are both bringing out chocolate Easter eggs this year . However, it does have a beefy taste and there are a number of recipes where bitter dark chocolate is used to add a depth of flavour to chilli, stews and casserole. The sticky dark brown paste has been a staple of the British diet since it was first produced in Burton-on-Trent, Staffs, in 1902. But while it has survived a long time, it triggers very strong feelings of love and loathing. While a distinctly British product, the name came from the French word to describe a large, covered earthenware or metal cooking pot. It was originally made from yeast supplied by the Bass brewery and became so popular that a second factory was opened in Camberwell Green, London, in 1907. In the early 1900s it was revered as a health food because it is rich in B vitamins and was issued to British troops in World War I as part of their rations to stave off conditions such as beriberi, which left them feeling weak and sick. Bosses at Unilever hope they will not be left with egg on their face after the Marmite Easter treat's release . Today, it is the nation’s second best-selling spread behind Rowse honey, which took the top spot in 2013. Unilever has formed a partnership with the confectionary firm Kinnerton to deliver the chocolate egg which carries hints of Marmite and is promoted under the slogan ‘love it or hate it’. The firm’s UK head of licensing Julie McCleave said: ‘Building on the success of our first ever Easter egg launch last year with iconic ice cream brands Magnum, Cornetto and Mini Milk, we wanted to bring something new to the Easter egg market once again for 2015. ‘By broadening the appeal of the Easter egg fixture, we anticipate that the new additions will drive sales for retailers by offering an exciting new product from brands that consumers know and love.’ The firm is hoping to tap into a growing Easter egg market that is now worth £365million in the UK every single year. The product will sit on the shelves next to a specially created Pot Noodle Easter egg, news that is set to delight chocolate loving students up and down the country. Marmite will be launched in a shell egg format, which saw an 18 per cent annual growth last year, and Pot Noodle will launch in mug and egg format, which has seen growth of 13 per cent. Competitors: The Pot Noodle and Marmite eggs face egg-cellent competition from Cadbury's, Nestle and Lindt . One manufacturer, Kimm & Miller, has been selling a Marmite flavoured milk chocolate bar, which contains two per cent of the spread, for five years. It has received some positive reviews as ‘suprisingly nice’ and a rating of 4.2 out of five on Amazon, however some complained that the Marmite taste was not powerful enough. Kinnerton’s Rachel Wyatt said: ‘Easter isn’t just for kids. We want to bring fun to Easter fixtures by using these two iconic brands. ‘The Marmite Easter egg, which shoppers will either love or hate, combines Marmite with chocolate.’ The two eggs, which go on sale in February, will each cost £5.",Marmite and Pot Noodle both launching chocolate Easter eggs this year.

Opponents say it threatens democracy by removing checks and balances set up in 1989 when Communism fell.
The EU and US had also asked for the law to be withdrawn.
The dispute has cast doubt over talks on a new financing agreement with the EU and IMF, seen as vital for market confidence in the central European country.
But the economic crisis facing Hungary overshadows both the government's policies and the opposition protests, says the BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest.
Fidesz won the elections promising to create a million workplaces - but there has been no growth so far.
And as the public mood worsens, so do the country's ratings, and the chances of attracting foreign investment, and creating more jobs, our correspondent says.
Several centre-left opposition parties joined in the protests on Monday evening, held near a gala event organised by the government to celebrate the new constitution.
By Nick ThorpeBBC News, Budapest
The governing Fidesz party controls 68% of seats in parliament, but the streets now belong to the opposition.
Nearly every day there are new demonstrations against one aspect or another of government policy - the new constitution, economic policy, the centralisation of the state media, or the closing of an opposition radio station.
One of the main speakers at Monday night's rally, Peter Konya, likened the government to the Titanic ocean liner, and the protesters to the iceberg which sank it.
But the economic crisis facing Hungary overshadows both the government's policies and the opposition protests. Fidesz won a landslide victory in 2010 promising to create a million workplaces.
But their attempts to generate growth have so far ended in failure. And as the public mood worsens, so do the country's ratings, and the chances of attracting foreign investment, and creating more jobs.
Protesters chanted slogans denouncing the centre-right Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, and carried placards denouncing his ""dictatorship"" as officials arrived for the event.
""Viktor Orban and his servants turned Hungary from a promising place to the darkest spot in Europe,"" said Socialist MP Tibor Szanyi, quoted by AFP news agency.
Aspects of the new constitution and accompanying laws which have come in for criticism include:
But Fidesz says the new constitution, or basic law, improves the legal framework of life in Hungary.
""Despite political debates we think it is an important value that for the first time, a freely elected parliament created the Basic Law,"" said Fidesz MP Gergely Gulyas, quoted by the Reuters news agency.
Mr Gulyas co-wrote the new law and shepherded it through parliament.
According to a December opinion poll, popular support for Fidesz has fallen to 18%, although it still leads the other parties.","Protesters have taken to the streets of Hungary to protest against the government's new constitution, which they say is a step in the right direction."
63086,"In recent years Ms Xavier has been earning the Brazilian minimum wage, which currently stands at 788 reals ($249; Â£165) a month, working in telemarketing.
Yet the 40-year-old, who lives in Bonsucesso, a scruffy middle class neighbourhood which lies between two sprawling favelas, or shanty towns, in the northern zone of Rio de Janeiro, says this is not enough to get by with.
""Rent for a house with one bedroom, living room, kitchen and bathroom [in Bonsucesso] is 750 reals [per month],"" she says. ""The minimum wage is not sufficient.
""I'm a person who wants to work, and setting up a business is a way of earning more money.""
To try to earn a higher income Ms Xavier hopes to move into the world of fashion, and start designing, making and selling artisan clothes.
To help her successfully launch and run the business, Ms Xavier is taking advantage of free classes offered by Sebrae, a Brazil-wide not-for-profit support service for sole traders and small businesses.
Sebrae's free classes in Rio are funded by the city's municipal council, the federal government, and contributions from large companies.
They teach numerous aspects of setting up and running a new business, such as bookkeeping, purchasing, price negotiation, and producing receipts.
Sebrae can also help participants get bank accounts and loans, and get their hands on technology such as chip and pin machines so they don't only have to accept cash.
The Sebrae workshops have now been running in Rio for two years, and attracted more than 5,000 participants so far.
They are held at the city's eight Knowledge Clouds, futuristic-looking buildings which provide free computer and library access across Rio's poorer northern and western zones, and which are owned and run by the city council.
For Rosa Virginia Souza de Barcelo, from Coelho Neto, also in Rio's northern zone, the Sebrae workshops are giving her a second chance.
The 64 year old mother of two was once a hairdresser, but had to give up her dream of running a salon when she got married and her husband's work took her away from Rio.
She says:  ""I used to be recognised by other neighbourhoods for cutting hair, people would seek me out. But I married and then I left. It was my son's time, and I had to give up work.
""I'm doing the course to update myself on what is happening, and how to do pricing.""
Meanwhile, Paulo Camoes Da Silva, who already runs his own dietary supplement business in Rio, says that thanks to the lessons he learned from attending Sebrae classes, he was able to see his profits rise ""considerably"".
Rodrigo Brantes, who leads Sebrae classes in Rio, says that the workshops can be particularly useful for sole traders from poorer backgrounds, who ""live quite precariously day-to-day in terms of business"".
He adds: ""Many such traders don't have financial controls, so on a daily basis if they make a sale that is a bit more significant than usual, that money is automatically spent on something private"".
Mr Brantes says that Sebra workshops can help these people better look after their cash flows, and try to build up reserves of money.
Another aim of Sebrae is to encourage more Brazilian sole traders and small firms to join the formal economy, and officially register their businesses.
The knock-on impact of this is that the businessmen and women, and any staff they have, would suddenly have to pay tax.
And with an estimated four millions Brazilians working in the informal sector, there is a lot of potential tax revenues to be gathered.
Mr Da Silva adds that there are numerous benefits to going legitimate, such as being able to get a bank account and a loan.
He adds: ""Today, as a legal entity I can buy products directly from manufacturers, without needing intermediaries [to buy on my behalf], which has increased my income by about 30%.""
Wilson Franca dos Santos, a spokesman for Rio city council's science and technology secretary, says that if sole traders or small firms in the city register with the authorities, then they can access a wealth or additional support and advice, such as grants and loans.
He says that ""if they are clandestine, then City Hall can't help them.""",A Brazilian woman who wants to start a business in order to earn a higher income is taking advantage of free workshops offered by a not-for-profit organisation.
35044,"Scientists from the University of East Anglia (UEA) say the device - the size of a USB stick - can detect bacteria directly from urine samples four times more quickly than traditional methods.
The technology could lead to faster treatment and better use of antibiotics, they say.
The findings were unveiled at a medical conference in San Diego.
Prof David Livermore, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said there was a need to move beyond the current ""carpet-bombing"" approach to treating urinary tract infections (UTIs).
""The way to do so lies in accelerating laboratory investigation, so that treatment can be refined earlier, benefitting the patient, who gets an effective antibiotic, and society, whose diminishing stock of antibiotics is better managed,"" he said.
The device can also detect resistance to antibiotics, said Dr Justin O'Grady, also from UEA's Norwich Medical School.
""Swift results like these will make it possible to refine a patient's treatment much earlier - and that's good for the patient, who gets the 'right' antibiotic, and for society - which can better manage or 'steward' its limited supply of antibiotics,"" he said.

69958,"With their pantaloons and ruff collars, the Swiss Guards are not the most manly of personal armies. And while there is little cause for pope's elite bodyguards to take up arms, their culinary skills at least are in demand; they have now produced a book of favourite pontifical recipes. A new cookbook - Bon Appétit, Swiss Guard - reveals the favourite dishes of Pope Francis and his two predecessors, Benedict XVI and John Paul II. Egg and chips again? A soldier from the Vatican's Swiss Guards shakes hands with Pope Francis . The book compiled by David Geisser, a 24-year-old soldier from Zurich who originally trained as a professional chef, includes delicacies from the three popes' home nations of Argentina, Germany and Poland. Pope Francis seemingly has a sweet tooth and has introduced 'dulce de leche', a caramelised milk pudding popular in Argentina, to the Vatican menu, as well as traditional Latin American empanadas. John Paul hankered after the Polish favourite, Pierogi, a stuffed pasta dish, and demanded it while recovering from a 1981 assassination attempt. Benedict was keen on Bavarian dishes such as wurstel salad and baked cherries with cream. The recipe book, published this week in German, contains the recipes preferred by his colleagues in the guard as well as various popes and prelates. Recipes favoured by Vatican Secretary of State, cardinal Pietro Parolin, and the prefect of the Papal Household monsignor George Gainswein also figure in the collection. Papal choice: Pope Francis, left, has a penchant for traditional Latin American empanadas, right . Swiss Guard commander Daniel Anrig said 'A soldier can only fight and wage war when he has eaten well, and enough.' But he left no doubt as to where his loyalties lie. 'There is nothing like Italian cuisine, it is the best in the world,' he said. Swiss Guards are the Swiss soldiers who have served as bodyguards of the Pope since the 16th century and are responsible for the security of the apostolic palace. They must be single Catholic men aged between 19 and 30, and at least 5ft 8.5ins tall. They swear allegiance to the Pope and are famous for their Renaissance-style uniform, with a plumed feather in their helmet, leggings and a high ruff collar.","Bon Appétit, Swiss Guard, reveals favourite dishes of Pope Francis and predecessors.

He said questions on his long-running BBC2 quiz are tougher than ever, adding he was still shocked at how much current contestants knew. Mr Paxman, 63, said that TV bosses should ‘stop insulting the public’s intelligence’ by ‘assuming we’re all idiots’ and said the reason why the  show has endured in popularity is down to the fact that it has refused to dumb down. He said: ‘We haven’t compromised. It’s quite hard and it will stay quite hard. In an age when you can win shedloads of money or fleeting glory by knowing the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s first name (even though that one did seem to stump President Obama),’ Elaborating on his passion for University Challenge which he has presented for almost 20 years, he told the Radio Times: ‘The main reason I love University Challenge is that it gives the lie to the media stereotype about young people – that they all know nothing, and couldn’t care less. ‘It’s complete rubbish. Every year we see more and more teams of young people who know amazing things, and you’re just left wondering in pleasurable disbelief, “How on earth did they get that?”’ He added: ‘Television bosses should stop insulting the public’s intelligence by assuming we’re all idiots.’ Mr Paxman said his quiz had the ‘courtesy’ of treating the audience as though it were ‘clever enough to take part.’ Earlier this year on the show, Mr Paxman was branded ‘rude’ and ‘nasty’ by some viewers for the way he dealt with a nervous contestant. The corporation was hit with 44 complaints after the show was broadcast.

Paxman, famous for his own tough interviewing style, refused to divulge how he fared against the students on his BBC2 show, saying: 'That one I’m not going to answer.'

46537,"Spain planned to attack Britain's colony in Australia and force them from the land by using cannons filled with fire-spreading 'hot shot', newly uncovered documents reveal. According naval archives the Spanish planned to lay siege on Sydney from the Spanish colonies in South America with a fleet of 100 boats. The invasion was intended to prevent the southern colony from being used by the British to cause 'great harm' to Spain's colonial interests in the Philippines and in central and southern America. King Carlos IV approved plans for the Spanish navy to launch a 100-ship attack and to fire new fire-speading ammunintion in their fight to expel Britain from their colony in Australia, new archival documents reveal . Spain wanted to 'take the fight to the British in the Pacific', and according to the documents, they feared Britain could attack them using the 'castaway bandits' it was sending there. The Spanish documents reveal that King Carlos IV approved the plot after a Spanish expedition arrived in Sydney in 1793. The British established a settlement there in 1788. Chris Maxworthy of the Australian Association for Maritime History said the Spanish intended to use heated ammunition that could set fire to ships and buildings on impact. 'The goal was the complete surrender by the British and their expulsion from the Australian land mass ... The effect [of the hot shot] would be to not only impact the targets ashore but also create multiple fires in the wooden buildings of that era in Sydney, particularly if the plans occurred during the hot summer months,' he told The Australian Financial Review. Chris Maxworthy of the Australian Association for Maritime History, above, said Spain's goal was the 'complete surrender by the British and their expulsion from the Australian land mass' The Dutch and the French had coveted territory in the southern Pacific but abandoned their plans after concluding  the land was unsuitable, but the Spanish were not deterred. Spanish naval commander Alessandro Malaspina reported back to his Government in the 1970s that Britain planned to use Australia for commercial reasons and to discover resources, rather than simply as a place to send their convicts. And he warned that Britain could use their colony as a base to launch an attack on Spain using an army of 'castaway bandits'. According to the historical documents, the deputy commander of the Spanish expedition, Jose de Bustamante y Guerra, proposed an invasion to King Carlos IV who approved it. He was then sent to Uruguay to start building the attack ships. But they never set sail. Mr Maxworthy said: 'As the military and naval commander, Bustamante was tasked to both defend South America from an anticipated British invasion, and to take the fight to the British in the Pacific.' If Spain had managed to seize the colony, historians say, Britain would have quickly recovered it. John West-Sooby, an expert on early Australian voyages, said the documents showed Spain was 'intended to strike first' and was concerned about the threat the British colony posed. He told the newspaper:  'The irritation of Madrid with respect to British 'incursions' into the Pacific during the eighteenth century is well known, but this confirms the bellicose attitude of the Spanish.'","Spain planned to attack Britain's colony in Australia using fire-spreading ammunintion.

9325,"The Australian government had been trying to confirm reports Sharrouf and fellow Australian Mohamed Elomar were killed in the Middle East.
It is now believed Elomar died in an air strike, but convicted terrorist Sharrouf may have survived.
The two men came to public attention last year after they posted pictures of severed heads in Syria on social media.
Some of those photos showed Sharrouf's seven-year-old son holding up the severed head of a Syrian soldier.
Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said last week the government was close to verifying Elomar's death.
However, on Sunday she said security and intelligence agencies were working to verify reports that Sharrouf had survived the coalition air strike ""which is believed to have killed Mohamed Elomar"", reported Nine News.
The two Australian men had travelled to Syria and then Iraq in 2013 to fight with IS.
Local media on Monday reported Elomar was recently killed by a drone strike but his friend was not killed.
Members of Sharrouf's family in Sydney also said Elomar had been killed.
Security officials are now checking the possibility Sharrouf faked his death in a bid to get his family back to Australia, the Daily Telegraph has reported.
His wife, Tara Nettleton, and their five young children, joined him in Syria, where his then 13-year-old daughter married Elomar.
Sharrouf was sentenced to four years in prison in 2009 for his role in a terror plot involving targets in Sydney and Melbourne.
He was arrested with several others in 2005 in what was then the largest anti-terror raid in Australian history.
Ms Nettleton's mother, Karen Nettleton, says her daughter and grandchildren want to return to Australia.
The Australian government has not offered them any assistance to return.

14060,"Tension in the area flared up a year ago when Morocco moved into the buffer zone, breaching a UN-backed ceasefire.
The Polisario Front, which wants independence for Western Sahara, dismissed Morocco's move as a gimmick.
Morocco recently rejoined the African Union, which it had left in 1984 after the body's recognition of Polisario as the territory's government.
The decision to withdraw from the Guerguerat zone is said to have been taken in person by the Moroccan King Mohammed VI.
The move came after the sovereign spoke on the phone with the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres who asked him to pull out his troops.
""The Kingdom of Morocco will proceed from today with a unilateral withdrawal from the (Guerguerat) zone,"" the Moroccan foreign ministry said in a statement.
Polisario said the move would hardly make any difference.
""The Moroccan decision to withdraw its troops near Guerguerat by a few hundred metres is window dressing,"" it said in a statement.
Western Sahara is a sparsely-populated area of mostly desert situated on the north-west coast of Africa.
It was annexed by Morocco in 1975 - a move resisted by the Polisario Front.
A 16-year insurgency ended with a UN-brokered truce in 1991 and the promise of a referendum on independence.
But this has yet to take place and Morocco still controls two-thirds of the territory, while thousands of refugees live over the border in Algeria.
Morocco's decision to withdraw its troops does not signify a major change in the kingdom's policy - it will still work towards ensuring international recognition of its claim over Western Sahara.
The announcement does, however, indicate a willingness to work with the United Nations, and in particular the new Secretary General, Antonio Guterres.
Mr Guterres' predecessor, Ban Ki-moon, infuriated Rabat by describing Morocco's annexation of Western Sahara as an ""occupation"" - a remark he later apologised for.
Morocco is rolling out a renewed campaign on Western Sahara - including joining the African Union, and King Mohammed VI making several trips to African countries.
The military withdrawal is also presumably intended to signal a willingness to compromise.
But the Polisario Front and its supporters will want to know whether that extends to giving the Sahrawi people the referendum on their future which has been delayed for so many years.","Morocco has withdrawn its troops from the Guerguerat buffer zone in the Sahara desert, the foreign ministry says."

We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information, when appropriate, as details become available,"" Kirby said in a statement.

19650,"South America's second-largest economy has been through so many different economic policies and experiments in the past two decades that a whole new vocabulary has sprung up to explain day-to-day economic transactions.
Buenos Aires' main commercial street, Calle Florida, now has dozens of ""little trees"" (arbolitos), the name given to black-market traders who buy and sell dollars openly in the streets. They stand around like bushes holding up their green leaves (dollar bills).
Some traders prefer to ""make puree"" (""hacer puré""), which is to buy dollars from the government and resell them to the ""caves"" (""cuevas""), the illegal exchange rate shops that deal with ""blue"" (black-market dollars).
This dynamic jargon is a reflex of a country that has been through a sort of economic rollercoaster ride for the past 15 years.
In 2001, the country had plunged into chaos - politically volatile, financially bankrupt and with violence erupting in the streets. It famously had three different presidents in two weeks.
By the second half of the decade, however, it was one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, on the back of soaring global commodity prices and a partly successful debt-restructuring plan. By 2005 it had surpassed its pre-crisis level.
Argentines are voting for their next president, as Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner stands down after eight years in power.
Her hand-picked successor, left-winger Daniel Scioli, was leading in the polls and had been expected to win comfortably.
However, the first round of voting failed to produce a winner, as Scioli was pushed very close by Mauricio Macri, the centre-right mayor of Buenos Aires.
To win outright in the first round, a candidate needed 45% of the vote or a minimum of 40% as well as a 10-point lead over the nearest rival.
The run-off on 22 November will be the first time an Argentine election will be decided by a second round.
But now, since 2011, Argentina is in deep economic trouble again, with weak growth, rising unemployment and high inflation.
Next week's presidential election - between government-backed Daniel Scioli and the opposition's Mauricio Macri - will be a chance for Argentines to chose which path to take in order to solve the current economic woes.
It will also be closely watched by South American neighbours such as Brazil and Venezuela, who are themselves at a crossroads, grappling for political answers in the face of economic storms.
Many of Argentina's more immediate economic problems are down to the government's exchange rate policy known as The Clamp (El Cepo), a series of measures adopted in 2011 intended to stem the flow of capital that began leaving the country.
It did contain the tides to some extent, but it created far greater problems domestically.
Buying dollars officially under the Cepo is a nightmare of red tape; buying them in the black market is prohibitively expensive. The costs for importing soared and were passed on to consumers, which made inflation shoot through the roof.
Under high inflation, many of Argentina's conquests in the past decade are beginning to be undone. Growth stalled at first, and there is now a threat of it entering reverse mode.
After including millions of people in the welfare system, Argentina stopped releasing poverty figures last year, a hint that those worse off are not seeing their lives improve.
Under the Kirchner family - first Nestor in 2003 and then Cristina Fernandez since 2007 - the government increased its presence in many sectors, from social programmes to nationalisation of private firms.
Now with cash-flow problems and low reserves, the government is in desperate need of revenues, but it is still virtually excluded from international bond markets, after it defaulted on its debt in 2001.
Argentines have been promised change by both presidential candidates.
Both Scioli and Macri agree that Argentina needs to open up its economy to the world again, by phasing out The Clamp, facilitating trade, re-entering bond markets and having a less controlled currency.
But the speed and the details of change vary according to the candidate.
Most expect Macri to change the economy more drastically, while Scioli's adjustments would come at a slower pace.
More importantly there is a highly symbolic element to this election that is likely to have repercussions in the whole of South America, even though its economic problems are very distinct.
The region's politics have followed great ideological waves in the past decades.
In the 1980s and 1990s, countries such as Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela elected governments that followed the so-called Washington Consensus - a series of doctrines that included privatising state-owned companies and reducing the presence of the state in the economy.
In the 2000s, most South American countries - including Paraguay, Ecuador, Bolivia and Uruguay - moved sharply towards the left, choosing governments that prioritised state-led investment and social programmes for the poor.
Now Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela are all facing tumultuous times in their politics and economics, and are again at a crossroads.
If Argentina elects Daniel Scioli on Sunday, it will be a way to give some validation to the Kirchner era that defined the country for the past 12 years.
Similarly, a Macri win would mean a rejection of that legacy and a return to more market-oriented policies.
Two weeks later, under great economic and social tension, Venezuelans will go to the polls in parliamentary elections, which are likely to be the toughest challenge for Nicolas Maduro, the successor to the late Hugo Chavez.
Venezuela has been implementing a ""Bolivarian revolution"" since 1999, with a strong presence of the state in all parts of the economy.
But with low oil prices and chronic shortages, its economy is now at its most fragile stage in over a decade.
Meanwhile, Brazil - which has just been through a similar test when it re-elected President Dilma Rousseff last year - is facing political turmoil amid a large-scale corruption scandal, as the opposition is pushing for her impeachment less than a year after she took office again.
At the same time, Rousseff is adopting economic measures to counter the country's crisis that are closer to the market-oriented policies preached by her opponent in last year's election, Aecio Neves.
Brazil's political future is still uncertain, as no-one knows whether the impeachment movement can be successful.
But Rousseff and the Workers' Party are facing a difficult test to keep the policies set by former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from 2003.
With so many question marks in voters' minds across the region, South Americans will be watching closely what happens to Argentina's politics and economy after Sunday, under a new president.","Buenos Aires, Argentina, is a city that has been through a lot of different economic policies and experiments over the past two decades."

88380,"South Africa’s hopes of qualifying for the quarter finals at the Africa Cup of Nations hang by a thread after they drew with Senegal in Mongomo. Oupa Manyisa rounded off a fine move with a clinical finish early in the second half to give Shakes Mashaba’s side the lead, but Serigne Mbodji, bizarrely wearing gloves despite the stifling jungle heat, leveled things up 15 minutes later with a towering header. The result puts Senegal top of the competitions’s ‘Group of Death’, a point ahead of both Ghana and Algeria, but Bafana Bafana must win their final game against the Black Stars to have any chance of progression. South Africa's Tokelo Rantie (right) celebrates Oupa Manyisa's opening goal against Senegal . Senegal's defender Kara Mbodji (right) celebrates after scoring the equaliser against South Africa . After a first half of few chances, the game came to life in the second, with Manyisa’s goal igniting a crowd that had already watched 135 minutes of football with barely a shot on target following the bore-fest earlier between the group's other two sides. A neat move saw Bournemouth striker Tokelo Rantie create space and feed Thuso Phala down the right. His low cross found Oupa Manyisa at the back post and the Orlando Pirates winger made no mistake, slotting coolly past Coundoul. As it had in their previous game against Ghana, going a goal behind brough Senegal out of their shells. They had shaded the possession from the off, but aside from an early run from Southampton’s Sadio Mane, returning from injury after missing the win over Ghana with a troublesome hamstring, the Senegalese carried little threat from open play, despite their array of forwards. However, when the majority of your team are over six foot and built like a fleet of tanks, set pieces will always be a threat. South Africa's goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane clears the ball during the Group C clash . South Africa's Dean Furman (left) challenges Senegal's Pape Kouli Diopi for possession . And so it proved. Having gone close several times - Stoke City’s Mame Biram Diouf the most culpable – and having had a Mane goal disallowed correctly for offside, finally the Senegalese superiority in the air told. Mbodji got up highest at the back post and powered a header over Thapelo Mabokgwane to equalize. The keeper was not directly at fault, but it was his uncertainty under the high ball that contributed to South Africa’s nervousness at set pieces. Mabokgawane always looked shaky, twice misjudging a cross and almost dropping it into his own net, and fumbling Diouf’s header in the lead-up to Mane’s disallowed goal. You have to sympathise with the Bafana Bafana boss Mashaba – after first choice keeper’s Senzo Meyiwa tragic death just weeks ago, he decided Darren Keet would get the number one jersey. But Keet was at fault for at least one, perhaps two of the three goals South Africa conceded against Algeria, and Mashaba has had to call upon Mabokgwane, who just a few months ago was considered fourth choice for the national side. The 27-year-old did make one excellent save, however, pushing away Dame Ndoye’s shot at full stretch as Senegal pushed for a winner. South Africa's Anele Ngcongca (left) challenges Senegal and Southampton's Sadio Man . South Africa's Furman, celebrates their opener against Senegal on Friday . Senegal's Cheikh Mbengue (left) challenges South Africa's Tokelo Rantie in the air . Senegal's defender Mbodji (centre) celebrates after levelling the tie on the hour mark . The result was harsh on South Africa, who played some lovely football before falling to defeat in their first game on Monday, and again showed plenty of one-touch interplay around the box, threatening to create chances. However, actually breaching a well-organised Senegalese backline proved difficult, and Bouna Coundoul was rarely overly stretched in goal. Sibusiso Vilikazi forced Coundoul into a sharp save with a rising drive after a lovely passage of play, and Thabo Matlaba fired just wide from a similar move on the other side, but chances were relatively few and far between. The niggly nature of the game suited Senegal, who carried far more physical presence, particularly in midfield. Doncaster Rovers midfielder, and South Africa captain, Dean Furman was incensed by one tackle in particular, when Lamine Gassama lunged in on Andile Jali, but escaped a booking. And, in the end, it was the extra height and presence that the Senegal side possessed, rather than any particular skill, that could have earned them all three points, Mbodji coming close to his second goal, again with a header from a set piece, in the closing stages.",South Africa's hopes of qualifying for quarter-final hang by a thread. Oupa Manyisa gave Senegal the lead with a clinical header. Serigne Mbodji equalised 15 minutes later with a towering header. The result puts Senegal top of the competitions’ ‘Group of Death’

26173,"By . Leon Watson . Last updated at 1:34 PM on 24th October 2011 . Argentina's fiery president Cristina Fernandez has scored a record election win after her government spread the wealth of a booming economy. Ms Fernandez won 53 per cent of the vote after 58 per cent of the polling stations reported nationwide. Her nearest challenger got just 17 per cent. It was the widest margin of victory in the country's history. Re-elected: Cristina Fernandez waves to supporters at her victory rally in Buenos Aires . Interior Minister Florencio Randazzo predicted the president's share would rise as polls reported from her party's stronghold of densely populated Buenos Aires province. 'Count on me to continue pursuing the project,' Ms Fernandez vowed in her victory speech. 'All I want is to keep collaborating ... to keep Argentina growing. I want to keep changing history.' Ms Fernandez is Latin America's first woman to be re-elected as president, but the victory was personally bitter sweet - the first without her husband and predecessor, Nestor Kirchner, who died of a heart attack last October 27. 'This is a strange night for me,' she said, describing her mix of emotions. 'This man who transformed Argentina led us all and gave everything he had and more ... Without him, without his valour and courage, it would have been impossible to get to this point.' Thousands of jubilant, flag-waving people crowded into the capital's historic Plaza de Mayo to watch on a huge TV screen as Ms Fernandez  spoke from a hotel. President Fernandez delivers a speech after winning a second four-year term by a huge margin over her closest rival, according to partial results . Emotional: President Fernandez is greeted by her son Maximo next to her daughter Florencia . Her supporters interrupted so frequently with their chants that she lectured them as a mother would her children: 'The worst that people can be is small. In history, you always must be bigger still - more generous, more thoughtful, more thankful.' Then, she showed her teeth, vowing to protect Argentina from outside threats or special interests. 'This woman isn't moved by any interest. The only thing that moves her is profound love for the country. Of that I'm responsible,' Ms Fernandez said. Cristina Fernandez has made no secret of her contempt for Britain's presence in the Falklands Islands. In June, she called Britain a 'crude colonial power' after David Cameron declared the Falkland Islands should remain British territory. President Fernandez had taken issue with remarks made by Mr Cameron at Prime Minister's Questions. The leader had praised the British troops who retook the Falklands from the Argentines during the 1982 war over the islands. But Ms Fernandez insisted Argentina and Britain should negotiate over the islands, as the U.N. General Assembly has urged. She said Argentina intends to keep raising its demands in international forums for negotiations with the British. 'We're going to say that in the 21st century they continue to be a crude colonial power in decline,' she said. Referring to Mr Cameron's statements, Ms Fernandez said that Argentina's foreign minister considered it an 'expression of arrogance.' The South Atlantic islands are claimed by Argentina, which refers to them as Las Malvinas. Later, she appeared in the plaza as well, giving a rousing, second victory speech, her amplified voice echoing through the capital as she called on Argentina's youth to dedicate themselves to social projects nationwide. Ms Fernandez was on track to win a larger share of votes than any president since Argentina's democracy was restored in 1983, when Raul Alfonsin was elected with 52 per cent. Her margin over Governor Hermes Binner and five other candidates was wider even than the 1973 victory margin of her strongman hero, Juan Domingo Peron. Her political coalition also hoped to regain enough seats in Congress to form new alliances and regain the control it lost in 2009. At play were 130 seats in the lower house and 24 in the Senate. Ms Fernandez suffered high negative ratings early in her presidency, but soared in popularity as a widow by softening her usually combative tone and proving her ability to command loyalty or respect from an unruly political elite. Most voters polled beforehand said they wanted government stability to keep their financial situations improving in what has been one of Argentina's longest spells of economic growth in history. Ms Fernandez, 58, chose her youthful, guitar-playing, long-haired economy minister, Amado Boudou, as her running mate. Together, the pair championed Argentina's approach to the global financial crisis: nationalise private pensions and use central bank reserves to increase government spending rather than impose austerity measures, and force investors in foreign debt to suffer before ordinary citizens. Argentina's world-record debt default in 2001 closed off most international lending, but it has kept the country booming ever since, with its economy expanding at twice the rate of Brazil's, economist Mark Weisbrot said. Fernandez with her son Maximo Kirchner, waves to thousands of supporters . Popular: Supporters celebrate after Fernandez won the presidential election at the Plaza de Mayo square in Buenos Aires . Flying the flag: Crowds gather to show their support for their re-elected president . The country faces tough challenges in 2012: Its commodities exports are vulnerable to a global recession, and economic growth is forecast to slow sharply in the coming year. Declining revenues will make it harder to raise incomes to keep up with inflation. Argentina's central bank is under pressure to spend reserves to maintain the peso's value against the dollar, while also guarding against currency shocks that could threaten Argentina's all-important trade with Brazil. Victory: Fernandez speaks to supporters after winning the general election . Mr Boudou, 48, could now win attention as a potential successor to Ms Fernandez, but navigating these storms will require much skill and good fortune. Opposition candidates blamed MS Fernandez for rising inflation and increasing crime and accused her of politically manipulating economic data and trying to use government power to quell media criticism. Former President Eduardo Duhalde, who fell from front-running rival to near-last in the polls, said in a dour closing speech that 'the country is dancing on the Titanic', failing to prepare Argentina for another global economic crisis.",Cristina Fernandez wins 53% of the vote. Her closest rival gets just 17%.
75354,"Economists had predicted the US Labor Department would report an increase of about 180,000 new jobs.
However, the unemployment rate fell to 6.6%, the lowest level since October 2008.
The jobless figures will raise concerns that, after strong growth in the second half of 2013, the US economic recovery is beginning to lose its steam.
US stock markets shrugged off the news - with shares on Wall Street rising in early trading.
By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service Economics correspondent
A disappointment but not a disaster, was how one American economist put it. 113,000 is certainly rather disappointing.
The workforce and the population in the US are growing so the economy needs to add new jobs to keep up.
How many is uncertain, but the most recent figure is in the range of economists' estimates.
In short, the US could do with faster job creation to get unemployment down and entice back the people who have given up looking for work. Those people are not counted as unemployed.
For sure, the unemployment rate is a lot better than in the dark days of the recession: 6.6% of the workforce now down from a peak of 10% in 2009.
But here's another important figure, the percentage of the population (over 16 years old) in work: between 62% and 63.4% in the years before the crisis, but below 59% now.
Getting America back to work is unfinished business.
The unemployment rate is calculated from a different survey to the jobs figure - known as non-farm payrolls. The rate is based on a survey of households, while the jobs figure is based on a survey of employers.
December's surprisingly weak payrolls figure was revised up only modestly to 75,000, from 74,000.
The construction industry, most vulnerable to the impact of bad weather, added 48,000 jobs in January, indicating that while the weather may have been responsible for December's weak figures, it does not appear to have been a factor in January.
Manufacturing hiring also picked up, adding 21,000 jobs.
Another positive factor from the report was that more Americans started looking for, and found, work.
But there were declines in hiring in retail, utilities, government, and education and health employment.
Earlier this week, an unexpectedly weak manufacturing report raised concerns about the strength of the US economy and sent the Dow Jones tumbling by 326 points.
However, analysts were not too despondent about the latest numbers.
""We think the employment market is improving, but will do so in fits and starts,"" said David Carter from Lenox Wealth Advisors immediately after the numbers were released.
""Today, the ugly headline number will negatively impact markets, but there are enough positive indications that ultimately the market will move higher over time.""
Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business, said: ""It is an improvement but a number this soft does feed worries about slowing US growth. The report fans uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's next move.
""Anyone looking for an alibi can point to the weather; it does not derail hopes of faster US growth and further Fed tapering,"" he added.
But one of the members of the Federal Reserve, Richard Fisher, told the broadcaster CNBC that the bank wouldn't be swayed by one month's numbers, blaming the weather for the weak report.
""I will say this about the rest of our committee, they are not swayed by a single number. They are thoughtful people,"" he said.
The US Federal Reserve has started withdrawing its extra support from the economy - a process known as tapering - after judging that the economy was improving, citing stronger jobs growth as one of the factors.
The central bank had been spending $85bn a month buying bonds, but has now reduced that to $65bn a month.
The unemployment rate is now very close to 6.5% - the level at which the Fed said it would start to consider an increase in interest rates, although most analysts agree a rate rise is still a long way off.","The US economy added 113,000 jobs in January, the lowest level since October 2008."
66742,"Substitute Karlan Ahearne-Grant put the visitors in front soon after the break.
But City were level just four minutes later when Joe Mason found the net with a close-range finish.
After both sides had further chances to score, Morrison rose to head home Peter Whittingham's cross and leave Cardiff fifth and the Addicks down in 17th.
The hosts, who were looking to end a two-game losing run, started brightly with Anthony Pilkington seeing a curling effort palmed away by Nick Pope.
Morrison then went close when his free header from a Whittingham corner was cleared off the line by Jordan Cousins.
But after Morrison was wasteful with another header and Joe Ralls miskicked when clear on goal, Cardiff let the Addicks back into the game.
Tony Watt went close with a header before half-time and Ahearne-Grant opened the scoring after the break when he rolled the ball past Simon Moore.
The goal provoked a reaction from the hosts as Mason finished from close range - the strike allowed to stand, despite appeals for handball.
Mason went close again and Moore denied Watt and Cousins at the other end before, having seen another header go over, Morrison finally hit the target to secure Cardiff the only home win of the day in the Championship.
Cardiff manager Russell Slade: ""It was important we bounced back and got a reaction from the disappointment of the last two games where we felt we were unfortunate.
""Despite our domination in the first half we were unable to convert our chances which was frustrating.
""But the good thing is after going a goal down we showed a lot more intensity and deserved the equaliser and the goal that brought us the three points.""

Charlton manager Guy Luzon: ""When you lead 1-0 away from home you make sure you show the character and organisation to keep the result.
""If you do that you will have space to counter-attack as the game goes on. But we couldn't, though our problem started in the first half as from every set-piece Cardiff won the ball and they had quite a lot of chances to score.
""That continued in the second half and we were eventually punished for that.""

It said the areas were small and would be sold with restrictions on their use - and a similar number would be sold later in the year.
The Woodland Trust said it would monitor the situation closely to make sure safeguards were in place.
All national parks have been facing large cuts in grants - the PDNPA has lost Â£3.5m in funding since 2010 - a cut of a cut of 36.5%.
Jane Chapman, assistant director at the authority, said: ""Having established or improved these woods - often by reclaiming former rubbish tips or quarry sites - then protected and maintained them over many years, we have fulfilled our primary objective as a national park.
""We now want to return these natural assets to the community, as we are reducing our liabilities at a time of budget reductions.

British design experts have added a revolutionary new weapon to the armoury of time-starved families who are fed up with the daily chore of cleaning. The Dyson Hard is effectively a cross between an old-style mop and a vacuum cleaner. The hi-tech device uses a wet wipe on a pad on the bottom to clean away stains on hard floors, removing dried on kitchen spills. Scroll down for video . The hi-tech device uses a wet wipe on a pad on the bottom to clean away stains on hard floors . Separately, there is a vacuum which sucks up all the toast crumbs and accumulated dust. Arguably, the new £249.99 device is the biggest innovation since Sir James Dyson first launched his bagless vacuum cleaners 20 years ago. Importantly, it taps in to the growing desire among householders for cordless machines, which are not tied up in a cat's cradle of cables. The Dyson Hard also serves as an alternative to plug-in steam mops, which have become enormously popular for cleaning hard floors in the past two years. Again, the new device has the advantage that it is more convenient. There are no power cables, no water tank to fill or delay while it heats up. Innovation: The Dyson Hard also serves as an alternative to plug-in steam mops . Sir James said: ‘Good technology should make everyday tasks quicker and easier. ‘Dyson’s high-speed motor technology has enabled Dyson engineers to develop a cordless machine capable of vacuuming dirt and wiping away stains simultaneously. One machine doing two jobs, in one action.’ The company will sell packs of wet wipes, which are wrapped around the base and clamped in place. These will be either standard versions or ones specifically for wood floors. The machine is compatible with packs of wipes available from other manufacturers. The cleaner head of the machine, also known as the DC56, can be removed to add a crevice and combination tool for cleaning hard to reach places. The company will sell packs of wet wipes, which are wrapped around the base and clamped in place . Dyson's range of innovative gadgets have become a staple of homes. The bagless vacuum cleaner, made 20 years ago, has even made it onto the list of 100 gadgets of . the past century that we can’t live without. Here are some of the other inventions that have made life easier for consumers: . Ballbarrow: A wheelbarrow with a ball replacing the wheel . Trolleyball: A trolley that launched boats . Bagless vacuum cleaner: The Dyson cleaner was the first bagless vacuum . Dyson Ball: Vacuum cleaner using the ball from the Ballbarrow . Dyson Airblade: Fast-working hand dryer . Air Multiplier: Bladeless fan . The fact it is cordless means that it is also useful for cleaning the car or worktops. The cleaner is powered by the Dyson digital motor V2, which is one third of the size of conventional motors, yet spins at 104,000rpm. While this is backed up by a powerful lithium-ion battery, which delivers 15 minutes of fade free performance. For stubborn dirt, there is a boost setting for six minutes of high intensity cleaning. The machine’s body is made from ABS Polycarbonate, which is the same material found in riot shields, while the lightweight reinforced wand is aluminium. The DC56 was slammed into obstacles from a number of different angles 39,154 times to ensure it was robust and durable. It was also subjected a tumble test with the machine spending over an hour in a rig simulating the effects of a giant cement mixer.

92570,"He left the field to an ovation fit for a hero. Radamel Falcao had his first goal for Manchester United and it proved to be decisive in clinching victory over Everton at Old Trafford. It also obscured the fact that a player who could end up costing United in excess of £50million had squandered a number of opportunities to get off the mark earlier in the game. Alongside him, Robin van Persie posed even less of a threat. Neither striker, it has to be said, is living up to his reputation at the moment. Radamel Falcao connects from inside the box to score his first Manchester United goal . The United striker pokes him against Everton after Angel di Maria's mishit shot broke to him in the box . Falcao and Robin van Persie have a good statistical record up front together but never seemed to click . The statistics will show that either Falcao and Van Persie have been on the scoresheet in all three games they have started together. Indeed, Van Persie’s first of the season at Leicester was presented to him on a plate by Falcao’s far post cross. Unfortunately for United, it ended there. Since then, this has looked less like a strike partnership and more like two forwards struggling side by side for top form; proof that the fantasy football approach of throwing together two big-name players does not guarantee instant success. There is no clever interplay, no obvious understanding, and no running off one another. Thank goodness United have Angel di Maria to pull it altogether. Robin van Persie picked up an early booking for a late tackle on Everton's Gareth Barry . Falcao has still not completed 90 minutes for United since joining on loan on transfer deadline day . In fairness to Falcao and Van Persie, both are working their way back from knee injuries. In Falcao’s case, he has yet to complete a full 90 minutes since rupturing the ACL in his left knee playing for Monaco in a French Cup tie in January, forcing him to miss the World Cup. Van Persie made it to Brazil with Holland after suffering a knee injury playing for United against Olympiacos last season, but he has not looked like the same player since. He had just one chance of note against Everton, latching onto to Di Maria’s first-time flick early in the game but steered the ball high over Tim Howard’s goal. Falcao, on the other hand, could have had a hat-trick. Click here to see our brilliant Match Zone including Falcao's match-winning heat map . Falcao was barely involved in United's build-up play but did his most important work in the Everton box . Robin van Persie spent more time on the ball for Manchester United but in less dangerous positions . Falcao contributed little aside from goals, but his strike proved to be the all-important winner . Inside the opening 20 minutes alone, he met Luke Shaw’s excellent cross with a diving header which failed to beat Howard, and then volleyed well wide after being played in by Di Maria’s flick. The former FC Porto and Atletico Madrid striker then met Di Maria’s corner on the full just before half-time and succeeded only in volleying it high into the Stretford End. It was the attempt of a player increasingly desperate to break his duck. He had two more half chances within two minutes of the restart and then snatched at another close-range effort when Shaw picked him out in the box again. But a player with Falcao’s remarkable goalscoring record will always be a threat. ‘A proper centre-forward,’ said Paul Scholes on television. Van Persie was in the game more throughout but less likely to arrive on the end of a move than his partner . Falcao found it difficult to escape the attentions of John Stones and Phil Jagielka but did get chances . The Colombian striker fires wide while his strike partner looks on hoping for a pass . When Di Maria for once mis-hit a shot in the 62nd minute, his teammate had dropped off his markers and was lurking to stab the ball past Howard from 10 yards. The relief on Falcao’s face was clear to see. Instead of making a rather awkward exit 11 minutes later, Old Trafford gave him a rousing ovation when he was replaced by James Wilson. ‘He needed that goal,’ said Louis van Gaal afterwards. ‘I have talked with him because I thought he was forcing himself too much to score a goal. Falcao was beginning to look frustrated as he failed to take his chances before he finally found the net . Falcao may be more used to his role in the opponent's area, but he performed a crucial role on his own line . It was clear how much Falcao's goal meant, both to the player himself and the United fans . ‘He’s a player who will normally make a goal every match and he has had to wait so long. I can understand that but now he has scored it will be better after the international break.’ United must hope their manager is right. Continuing to play Falcao and Van Persie together will mean dropping Wayne Rooney into his less preferred midfield role and fewer opportunities for Juan Mata. The two stars leading the line must produce, both individually and as a partnership, to make it all worthwhile. Louis van Gaal congratulates his expensive striker whose goal secured a vital three points for United .",Radamel Falcao scored his first goal for Manchester United against Everton. The Colombian striker was barely involved in the build-up play. Robin van Persie was less likely to arrive on the end of a move.

95256,"Newly installed rebel political leader Aleksandr Zakharchenko made the call after other rebels said the army had taken a key city and encircled Donetsk.
Russia immediately renewed its offer to send a humanitarian mission, a day after Western powers warned against using such a mission to send troops.
An estimated 1,500 people have been killed in the four-month conflict.
Pro-Russian rebels stormed cities in the east and took over government buildings in April in a bid for independence.
But the government stepped up operations to retake rebel-held areas following the election of Petro Poroshenko as president in June.
Rebel commander Igor Girkin was quoted by Russian media as saying that Krasnyi Luch, which connects Donetsk city with Ukraine's Luhansk region, had been ""captured"".
Girkin, who is also known as Strelkov, said his men in the Donetsk region were ""completely encircled"".
Mr Zakharchenko later said in a statement on a rebel website: ""We are prepared to stop firing to bar the spread of the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe.""
Russia, widely accused of supporting the rebels' efforts, also called for an ""urgent action to avert an impending humanitarian crisis"".
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made the request during a phone call with US counterpart John Kerry, a statement said.
""The minister urged support for Russia's initiative to deploy a humanitarian mission in the south-east in co-ordination with the relevant international structures,"" the foreign ministry statement said.
Mr Kerry apparently replied that such efforts were already being made by the Ukrainian government.
On Friday, the UK and US had warned Russia not to use a humanitarian mission as a pretext for sending its forces to help the rebels.
Meanwhile, reports from the city of Luhansk, second only to Donetsk in its importance to the rebels, suggest living conditions are dire.
The city council reported on its website (in Russian) on Saturday that the city of 425,000 people had been without electricity and power for a week.
Parts of the city were still being bombarded and most shops were shut.
The Ukrainian government, which has not commented on rebel claims about the situation in the east, says 13 soldiers and one civilian were killed in fighting on Friday.

91199,"Can just traveling to a city make you better looking? Liz Eckert would say so. On a recent visit to southern California, the Connecticut real estate agent was struck by the gorgeous scenery—as in, the people. She chalked it up to the locals' regular access to sand, surf, and sunshine. ""After one week there, I actually looked and felt healthier,"" she says. ""My skin was glowing, my hair was shiny, and even my nails grew—and they never grow."" Given the area's seemingly magical powers of osmosis, it's no wonder that both San Diego and Los Angeles made it into the top five cities for America's best-looking people, according to Travel + Leisure readers. New results are in from the annual America's Favorite Cities survey, in which readers rate 35 metropolitan areas for qualities such as people-watching, walkable streets, and hot music scenes. This year, the attractive locals category saw a fair amount of movement: the new number 1 city is a past champ that had previously fallen from grace, and several cities have made impressive rebounds in the rankings or else seemingly let themselves go. (What happened, Las Vegas?) While plenty of the top 20 cities offer the potentially transformational elements that Eckert found in SoCal, other winners offered proof that being gorgeous is more than skin deep. Non-coastal (or downright chilly) cities such as Minneapolis, Nashville, and Kansas City fared just fine—and also ranked well with readers for being friendly. T+L: America's most romantic cities . One new category in this year's survey may have also boosted chemistry: a charming accent, something T+L readers found lacking with the folks of Phoenix and Seattle, who also ranked among the less attractive.Of course, a key ingredient in attraction is a solid fashion sense and that may be a reason that some sunny cities landed near the bottom. ""Locals in Orlando know what they are to the world""—a giant theme park—""and don't even try anymore,"" says Lisa Finkelstein, a Tallahassee-based freelance writer. ""Since it's warm much of the year, shorts and a pullover shirt, plus tennies, takes them everywhere,"" she says. ""Even Angelina Jolie can't work that look."" Number 1: Miami . Did they do something new with their hair? These party-loving Floridians have reclaimed the top slot this year, which they haven't held since 2009. They also ranked in the top 10 for their fashion sense and fit physiques. See for yourself over drinks at one of the city's highly rated cocktail lounges. The only downer: Miamians also ranked as being pretty aloof. Number 2: San Diego . It's hard to argue with a beauty regimen of fresh air and miles of beaches for staying in shape. This SoCal city has consistently ranked as the first runner-up for good looks in T+L's survey, even if readers tend not to be so impressed with the locals' conversational skills. San Diegans do, however, score well for being tech-savvy. Number 3: San Juan, Puerto Rico . Last year's winner slipped a few spots this year, but the island city is still a magnetic place for mingling with a good-looking crowd: it also ranks in the top three for its happy hour and singles scene. Readers downgraded the Puerto Rican city for its sense of style, but they were suckers for the fabulous local accent. T+L: America's best cities for singles . Number 4: Charleston . Proof that voters are a little fickle: this South Carolina city was No. 1 for attractive locals in 2010, but fell to No. 7 last year. While readers still find the locals to be charming—and think that the city makes a great romantic getaway—they were easily distracted by all the good shopping, ranking the city in the top five when it comes to antiques, design stores, and indie boutiques. Number 5: Los Angeles . It's easy to make jokes about some locals having ""work"" done. But whatever the reason, Angelenos have ranked in the top five for looks in the last three out of four years, and they won the silver medal this year for their fashion-forward style. They're also trying that catch-more-flies-with-honey strategy: their niceness factor went up by three positions since last year. Number 6: Nashville . A cowboy hat sets off the face nicely, doesn't it? Music City jumped up seven places in the attractiveness category since last year, even if it lost its grip on the top spot in the survey for music. If you want an alternative to the honky-tonks, look for any crowd wearing SEC team shirts: Nashville ranked No. 3 for its sports bars. Number 7: Austin . Folks in the Texas capital seem to be simultaneously quirky, smart, and buff: the only personal quality that voters were less-than-smitten with was perhaps residents' tendency toward hipster fashion. Look for them hanging out by the No. 2","T+L readers ranked 35 cities for qualities such as people-watching and walkable streets. Miami ranked No. 1 for attractive locals, while San Juan, Puerto Rico, ranked No. 3 for its happy hour. Austin ranked No. 7 for its hipster fashion."

65901,"By . Brian Barwick . Football pundits are now a permanent part of the TV scene, dispensing their thoughts and theories in stadiums, studios and, at this World Cup, rather inventively on Copacabana Beach. For many recently retired footballers it has become a lucrative second career, while for others it’s a useful buffer between finishing playing the game and going back to it. So, it is fitting during a World Cup in Brazil to look back on the men who helped start the ‘experts’ ball rolling - in the year we saw Pele, Carlos Alberto, Gerson, Jairzinho and Co triumph in such glorious fashion. VIDEO Scroll down to see Alan Mullery's spat with Malcolm Allison . Good old days: ITV's 1970 World Cup punditry team which included Jimmy Hill (third from left) It is 1970 and the front cover of the Radio Times World Cup edition sports a photograph of revered England captain Bobby Moore standing proud, TV Times chooses a glamorous blonde model in an England shirt. Vive la difference! Their differences didn’t end there. BBC had Joe Mercer and Don Revie in Mexico, while ITV put together their famous World Cup panel in London: Manchester United and Scotland’s Paddy Crerand, Wolves and Northern Ireland’s Derek Dougan (The Doog), and the gloriously extrovert Malcolm Allison. They would regularly wind each other up and Allison became the star turn. He had an answer for everything - or almost everything and Arsenal left back Bob McNab, left out of Sir Alf Ramsey’s World Cup squad, was armed with a bell to ring when he wanted to get a word in edgeways. Cover story: England captain Bobby Moore for Radio Times (left) and a model for TV Times . Outspoken, irreverent, argumentative, occasionally bang out of order and good telly, the ITV panel created a real stir. And while the BBC still won all the big head-to-head battles, the viewers often turned to ITV on the final whistle to hear what the four musketeers — in kipper ties, flares and wide lapels — made of it all. They were a smash hit and with Brian Moore and Jimmy Hill firing the questions, things always got lively. Controversy was never far away. England midfielder Alan Mullery, fresh home from having been knocked out of the World Cup, went to the live studio and gave his chief critic Allison both barrels. He fished an England cap out of a plastic bag, thrust it in Allison’s direction and said: ‘I’ve got 30 of these and this one’s spare’. For once, the uncapped Big Mal was speechless. These days, World Cup punditry has become a little more ordered (plastic bags are at a premium!) with greater immediate analysis of the action, more camera angles and technical gizmos to help illustrate a point more clearly. Glory: Brazil with Pele, Carlos Alberto, Gerson, Jairzinho and Co triumphed in 1970 . The current choice of individuals on both channels reflects the wider world of football and there are still plenty of characters. But wouldn’t it have been fun to hear the most famous World Cup panel’s take on England’s super-early exit, Robben’s diving, the magnificence of Messi — and a certain Luis Suarez and his wandering teeth? Bob, time to get the bell out mate! Confident: Brian Clough as ITV pundit . Having watched football on TV for more than 50 years and worked at the top of the business for BBC and ITV Sport, I have listened to some great pundits — and gave some of them their break in broadcasting. Here are five who made the viewers sit up and take notice. Jimmy Hill . An absolute one-off. He starred on The Big Match and when he did Match of the Day, he presented the programme and did the analysis! Awash with ideas, he has always had the integrity of the game at heart. I once told him he had finished top of a popularity survey among football presenters. ‘Great,’ he said. I then told him he had also finished top of an ‘unpopularity’ poll. ‘Great as well,’ he said. ‘The place not to finish in that type of thing is in the b****y middle!’ Brian Clough . Irreverent, awkward, and self-opinionated, Clough was not short of self-confidence. It all made for compelling TV, even if it tripped him up — for example when he famously called the Poland goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski a ‘clown’ a few days before he had the game of his life against England.  As a young viewer I hung on his every word. Class act: BBC pundit Alan Hansen . Martin O’Neill . Quirky, curious, independent, occasionally left-field and with a great career as a player and manager to back up his views. He’s now the  manager of the Republic of Ireland but I gave him an early break in TV when George Best failed to show up for the BBC’s coverage of the 1986 World Cup. O’Neill is currently providing interesting thoughts on the World Cup for ITV from Copacabana Beach. Gary Neville . Fresh out of the dressing room, bright, opinionated and articulate. He was interesting and forthright as a player and took all that enterprising thinking into a new career on Sky Sports. Alan Hansen . Took the class he showed as a player at Liverpool into his long career at the BBC. Hansen was nervous when he started but soon found his feet and has spent two decades dissecting goals and making perceptive comments. He retires after this World Cup and will be missed.",ITV pundit Malcolm Allison was the star turn at the 1970 World Cup.

74885,"Juma Munyankore, 25, and Hamza Mohumed, 24, carried out a ""vicious, outrageous attack"" which was seen by a child in a Coventry garden last September.
The pair were originally charged with attempted murder but the court accepted their guilty pleas to wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.
Munyankore was jailed of 10 years, nine months and Mohumed for nine years, four months at Leamington Justice Centre.
Mohumed had entered a guilty plea to the lesser charge but Munyankore was handed a longer jail term at the hearing on Friday after admitting the offence on the fourth day of a trial.
Det Con Helen Keating, of West Midlands Police, said it was unclear what sparked the row between the two defendants and the 26-year-old victim they had known for seven years.
Doctors said he was ""lucky to survive"" his injuries to his chest and legs, with one wound puncturing one of his lungs, diaphragm and liver. They were inflicted by a half-moon shaped dagger.
""It was a vicious, outrageous attack in the middle of the afternoon and carried out just yards away from a young child,"" Det Con Keating said.
The victim, who had earlier gone to greet and shake hands with the pair as he walked to the barbecue, was airlifted to hospital after the afternoon attack on 11 September.
Officers found Mohumed, a Somalian national, hiding under a dressing gown at his home in The Bentree, in the Stoke area of Coventry, two days after the attack.
Meanwhile Munyankore, a Rwandan national, of Middleborough Road, Radford, was handed over to police by his mother hours after officers carried out a warrant at his home.","A man and a woman have been jailed for wounding a man with a dagger in an ""outrageous"" attack on a young boy."

Students at certain American colleges are facing the beginning of a school year without initiation ceremonies at fraternities and sororities as administrators hope to dramatically cut down the amount of hazing on campus. Gone are the traditional fraternity open houses and introductory bashes at sorority houses as officials at New York's Binghamton University banned recruiting a new class of student pledges. The strong decision for a ban comes after multiple reports surfaced last year of violent hazing on their campus, prompting fears that those stories of students being forced to hold hot coals and running over beds of rocks could turn fatal like some more extreme cases at other universities. Quiet campus: New York's Binghamton University banned recruiting a new class of student pledges after a wake of complaints about hazing abuses . Hazing is not new among young college students but the well-publicized cases at Dartmouth University- where students were forced to eat vomit omelets - and Florida's A&M University - where a student on the drum band was beaten to death on a school bus - that left Binghamton administrators fearing the worst. Though there were no confirmed deaths or hospitalizations due to the hazing on Binghamton's campus, students sent cries for help to the school's officials hinting that they weren't far off. The New York Times reports that one anonymous email sent from a student to administrators told of the undisclosed lengths that his possible fraternity brothers would go to make sure he fit in. 'I was hosed, waterboarded, force-fed disgusting mixtures of food, went through physical exercises until I passed out, and crawled around outside in my boxers to the point where my stomach, elbows, thighs and knees are filled with cuts, scrapes and bruises,' the student wrote in the email. A junior female student wrote about what two of her younger friends were being put through, telling of how sorority pledges had to stand in a freezing cold shower while reciting the Greek alphabet. Others had to eat unidentified mixtures of food that were cooked up solely to make the diner throw up. At the end of the email, she wrote a plea for top-down action: 'Save the innocent and naïve who can’t seem to save themselves'. Binghamton, one of the state's best public schools located more than three-hour's drive from New York City, did just that. The abuses: Though no students came forward publicly, several complained of being 'waterboarded, force-fed disgusting mixtures of food, and made to pass out from over-exercise' According to the school's student newspaper Pipe Dreams, administrators cited an 'alarmingly high number of serious hazing complaints this spring' and 'the serious physical and psychological health risk to all involved.' as the reasons behind the decision. That said, only three of the 53 sanctioned fraternities and sororities were temporarily banned from recruiting new pledges. One of the biggest problems facing any institutional change is the fact that no students are willing to publicly come forward and complain about the happenings. In the case of Dartmouth, a former fraternity brother named Andrew Lohse wrote an editorial describing in horrific detail the ways in which pledges were treated. As a result, 27 other fraternity brothers faced charges but were eventually cleared. Previous problems: The Binghamton complaints came around the same time as well-publicized cases at Dartmouth University (pictured)- where students were forced to eat vomit omelets . While the parents of children who lived through the extreme pledging process and the students themselves may be appreciative of the drastic action, it seems that others on campus feel the decision takes away one of the touchstones of 'traditional' college life. At Binghamton, one of the biggest alleged offenders was Alpha Pi Epslion, an off-campus fraternity which is therefore only answerable to local police and not the university. The Times tells the story of how police sergeant Michael Senio went to the house to respond to anonymous complaints about hazing abuses taking place but because there was no named victim, he had no legal authority to go inside. 'I can only speculate what was going on, but we could see the basement, which was like a disgusting-looking dark dungeon with hoses and standing water on the ground,' he said.",New York's Binghamton University temporarily banned fraternities and sororities from recruiting new pledges.

Lozowski booted five penalties and converted all four of his side's tries as Wasps grabbed a crucial bonus point in their battle for qualification. Prop Simon McIntyre, wing Josh Bassett, number eight Guy Thompson and replacement Elliot Daly went over for the home tries as they replied from three points down at the break to win the second period 27-3. Fly half Alex Lozowski carries forward against London Irish as his 22 points helped Wasps to victory . Irish fly-half Myles Dorrian kept his side in the game during the opening period with four penalties and a conversion of prop Leo Halavatau's try, but could only add one further penalty before the end. The key to the win was the Wasps pack, who were dominant at the set-piece, but their mistakes within kicking distance kept Irish in the game during the first period. Dorrian took advantage of an early error with a penalty and added a second to keep his side in front after Lozowski had opened the hosts' account. But the powerful pack set the trend and were at the forefront of Wasps' opening try when a drive reached the Irish line and McIntyre picked up from a ruck, went left around the fringe and found a gap for a converted touchdown. Wasps' Elliot Daly scores a try in the corner as Alex Lewington (top) and Ross Neal fail to hold him back . Wasps started to stretch out when Lozowski booted his second penalty, but another error saw the clinical Exiles fly-half make it a third successful penalty. And the Exiles chipped away at the Wasps lead again with the half-time whistle approaching and got to within four points as Dorrian struck for a fourth time, this penalty from 38 metres. And the visitors' tenacity paid off as centre Ross Neal, who had come close to scoring earlier in the half, nearly got a try, but was hauled down just short. Yet, from the series of rucks that followed, nobody could stop powerful Tongan Halavatau from going over from two metres. Darren Allinson clears the ball from the ruck as the Exiles fall to Wasps at Adams Park . With Dorrian converting and adding another penalty on the re-start, Irish were set fair with a six-point advantage. But that was as good as it got for Irish, whose hopes of progression are now hanging by a thread. Wasps retook the lead when Bassett finished off a great move which involved his stand-off in the left corner, with the conversion taking his side a point to the good. The home side never lost the lead after that - and did not look likely to either as two more penalties from Lozowski put Wasps further ahead. Wasps and Irish players line up to observe a two-minute silence on Remembrance Sunday . Irish did not help themselves when replacement prop Jamie Hagan found himself in the sin-bin inside the final quarter of the game. And that signalled the end of the Irish challenge. The home fly-half put his forwards five metres from the Exiles line and, with them a man down, a driving line-out saw Thompson easily bundle his way over. The bonus point was sealed when Wasps turned over an Irish attack near the home line for a spectacular 80-metre converted try which was started by Lozowski and finished by flyer Daly.","Wasps' Alex Lozowski kicked five penalties and converted all four tries.

83593,"A health and safety inspector suffered life-changing burns in an NHS hospital while undergoing routine surgery after staff made a mistake using an electric blanket known as a 'hot dog'. Mike Wilcock, 58, required a skin graft after suffering third-degree burns to his right buttock after undergoing surgery to remove a cyst on his kidney at Maidstone Hospital in Kent. Inner London Crown Court heard that staff had not been properly trained in how to use the electric blanket. Mike Wilcock suffered third degree burns to his buttock during the botched surgery in Maidstone hospital . Mr Wilcock underwent the routine surgery on a kidney cyst at Maidstone Hospital, pictured, in 2012 . Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust is facing a possible six-figure fine after admitting failing in its duty under the 1974 Health and Safety Act. Prosecutor William Davis told the court that Mr Wilcock gone through a 'stressful and painful experience' since the procedure in September 25, 2012. The temperature of the warming equipment, which can rise to 50C in less than an hour, had soared during Mr Wilcock's operation because a cold saline bag was touching a sensor, the court heard. The injuries - caused during the routine operation - meant he was admitted to a specialist burns unit at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead during September of 2012. The burn caused permanent scarring and left Mr Wilcock out of work for four months. He must now be chauffeured by his wife Eileen due to mobility problems, Inner London Crown Court heard. 'It caused the mattress to become extremely hot,' Mr Davis said. Malcolm Fortune, defending the NHS Trust at Inner London Crown Court, pictured, asked Mr Justice Sweeney to consider a fine in the region of £200,000 to £300,000 as the affair has already cost them almost £100,000 . No alarm was raised during the operation and his injuries were only discovered when Mr Wilcock woke up to discover a large burn on his right hip and buttock, the court heard. He was referred to a burns unit and has needed repeated hospital treatment on his burns, and has also developed cardiac problems, the hearing was told. 'Mr Wilcock has suffered serious and ongoing effects as a result of his injury,' Mr Davis said. The court heard the hospital trust had committed eight breaches of duty over 17 months after first acquiring the equipment in April 2011. They included failing to provide adequate training to staff on how to use the equipment and not properly investigating two previous incidents, including one patient who received minor burns caused by the machine. Mr Wilcock, who works for the Health and Safety Executive, is now pursuing a civil claim. The trust's medical director Dr Paul Sigston offered a direct apology to Mr Wilcock and his wife Eileen when he appeared in the witness box during today's hearing. He said: 'I'd like to express to Mr and Mrs Wilcock that I'm deeply sorry this event occurred. 'I'm aware of the harm and stress impacted on their lives.' Mr Wilcock, left,  who is a health and safety inspector, said the September 2012 incident changed his 'perception of life' and has left him with permanent scarring to his buttock and hip area, right . After the hearing, Mr Wilcock, from Tunbridge Wells, said his injuries had 'significantly' affected his life, as he raised concerns that other hospitals using the equipment may not have trained staff properly. 'I have changed my perception of life,' he said. 'I have scars that will last for the rest of my life, causing pain and discomfort. 'This equipment is used in lots of hospitals. That worries me. Are other hospitals using the equipment training their staff to use it properly? 'How could two previous patients have suffered minor injuries and not be noticed? How many other hospitals has that happened? 'I have no personal animosity for the individuals concerned. I know they have been personally upset by the incident. 'If I had been a child or a vulnerable older adult, we could have been talking about a death because of the seriousness of the burn.' Malcolm Fortune QC, representing the trust, said the introduction of the hot dog equipment - which is no longer used by the trust - would have saved the organisation £250,000 over five years but he denied it was brought in as a 'cost-cutting exercise.' The case had already cost the deficit-hit trust around £100,000 and a fine of between £200,000 and £300,000 should be considered, he added. Mr Justice Sweeney said he would determine the amount the hospital will pay at Maidstone Crown Court next Thursday.

Cagliari had lost its last three matches but gained an advantage when Inter captain Yuto Nagatomo was sent off in the 27th minute following two yellow cards.

It would have been worse for Inter if Samir Handanovic had not saved a penalty after Vidic's mistake. 'I made some mistakes when evaluating the squad rotation,' Inter coach Walter Mazzarri said. 'When we were down to 10 men we should have acted differently: an experienced team would've sat back, not conceded four in the first half and tried to come back in the second.' Napoli won 1-0 at Sassuolo in the lunchtime kickoff, while 10-man AC Milan was held to a 1-1 draw at Cesena. Fiorentina also drew 1-1 at Torino as did Chievo Verona at home to Empoli. Juventus and Roma both maintained their perfect start to the season with victories on Saturday. Inter Milan manager Walter Mazzarri reacts during the match in what was a very hard-to-take defeat . Cagliari took the lead in the 10th minute when Nagatomo failed to deal with a long ball and headed straight at Marco Sau, who fired home. But Inter was back on level terms eight minutes later when Rodrigo Palacio took a free kick quickly and set up Pablo Osvaldo. The turning point came shortly afterward when Nagatomo picked up two yellow cards in as many minutes and was dismissed. Cagliari immediately restored its advantage as Handanovic did well to parry a fierce strike from Daniele Dessena, but Ekdal pounced on the rebound. Ekdal doubled his tally five minutes later, tapping in Victor Ibarbo's cross after a great run from the Colombia winger who had bamboozled the Inter defense. It almost got worse shortly before halftime when Vidic mistimed a sliding tackle on Sau in the area. However, spot-kick specialist Handanovic saved Andrea Cossu's penalty.

But Cagliari did get a fourth moments later when Ekdal completed his hat trick after Inter failed to clear a corner. Osvaldo thought he had pulled one back for Inter shortly after the interval but his effort was ruled out for offside. City rival Milan was also forced to play at a numerical disadvantage after Cristian Zapata was sent off in the 73rd minute for denying Gregoire Defrel a clear scoring opportunity. Cesena had taken a shock lead in the 10th minute when Christian Abbiati - replacing the injured Diego Lopez - fumbled a simple attempt from Guido Marilungo and Davide Succi was on hand to tap in the rebound. Jeremy Menez almost recorded his fourth goal of the season but it was struck off after Fernando Torres was adjudged to be offside.

77962,"The number of digital enterprises in Wales jumped by 9.2% last year, says the analysis by law firm Nockolds.
Numbers rose from 3,000 in 2014 to 3,275, although this is below all UK nations and regions except for Northern Ireland and north east England.
The report said cities including Cardiff and Swansea could ""flourish"" because of comparatively low rents.
The number of digital businesses in London rose by 11.6% - from 37,575 to 41,940 during the same period.
Digital businesses range from software and app development to IT consultancy.
According to Nockolds, Wales has emerged as one of the fastest growing UK nations or regions in recent years, with the digital economy a key driver of growth.
The report said the surge in new business creation in the tech sector in Cardiff was fuelling a jobs boom, which is ""rippling out"" to the wider south Wales region.
The Welsh Government estimates there are currently more than 600 firms in the IT sector alone, employing an estimated 30,000 people - around 3.5% of the Welsh workforce.
Meanwhile, there are ambitious plans in the Swansea Bay City Region, aiming to create up to 33,000 jobs over the next 20 years along an ""internet coast"".
Nicola Lucas, a solicitor at Nockolds, said the growth of the digital economy was ""reasonably well distributed"" throughout the UK.
""Cardiff is particularly attractive for financial technology start-ups,"" she said.
""The growth of the financial sector in Cardiff, which has benefited from the relocation of back and middle office functions post-financial crisis, is providing fertile ground for fintech [financial technology] businesses who have a significant market on their doorstep, along with an appropriately skilled workforce.""
She added that rail network improvements would improve access while office rents in Cardiff were typically less than half that of London.
""The only concern is whether Wales can provide the funding environment to hold onto start-ups once they reach a certain scale, or whether these businesses will focus expansion in other regions, such as London,"" said Ms Lucas.
Warren Fauvel, founder of digital health business Nudjed and part of Cardiff Start, a collective of business start-ups, said there were lots of positive signs for the sector in Wales.
""It's a really exciting time for us in Cardiff, Swansea and across Wales and these figures back up what we probably know as a community is starting to happen,"" he said.
""But one of the key things to emphasise is it has to be supported by a consistent strategy that looks across the decades and not just at figures right now.""
He said the digital economy was a great way for Wales to have international businesses again after the decline of traditional industry.
Mr Fauvel, who was brought up in Rhondda, said there needed to be good literacy, numeracy and science education to help Welsh people see beyond the valleys and cities they live in.
""We need continued support from government, local authorities and we need an education system that produces students with good core skills - it's not the most exciting message, but it very much comes down to the people,"" he said.","The number of digital businesses in Wales is among the fastest growing in the UK, according to a new report."
79897,"By . Emma Reynolds . PUBLISHED: . 11:21 EST, 9 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:06 EST, 10 October 2012 . Afghanistan's first female rapper Sosan Firooz is making history in her country, despite her chosen career angering some of her family members. Rap is just started to develop a following in the wartorn nation and the 23-year-old sees it as the best way to tell her story. Women performing is frowned upon in her country, but Firooz has defied convention to sing about hard-hitting subjects including the repression of women and her hopes for a peaceful Afghanistan. Scroll down for video . Outspoken: Sosan Firooz, 23, raps about the repression of women in Afghanistan, her hopes for peace in her home country . She also raps about her family's escape to Iran during the Afghan . civil war of the 1990s and the hardline Taliban regime's rise to power. Firooz has spoken openly of the misery she felt as a child during a five-year stay in a country in which she claims people looked with disdain on Afghan refugees. 'While we were in Iran, we were called ""dirty Afghans"" and told to go to the back of the line at the bakery,' said Firooz, who also spent time as a refugee in Pakistan and returned to Afghanistan with her family seven years ago. Those who leave, she sings, will only get jobs washing dishes or working at a car wash. 'They will miss their homeland,' she sings in her first single, Our Neighbors. 'They will want to kiss the dust of their homeland.' 'What is the result of Afghans being refugees in Iran and Pakistan?' she continues in Dari, one of Afghanistan's two main languages. Controversial stance: Firooz has to be accompanied by her father at all times when out for her own protection . 'Half of them are addicts and the other half are terrorists!' So far, the track has only been released on YouTube, with a video that shows a series of pictures of Firooz posing in a hip-hop style gear, with jeans, dangling chains and bracelets. In some pictures, she wears a bandana with skulls, but her long hair is not completely covered - a rarity among Afghan women, including the few female singers. Firooz is also an actress, having had small parts in a number of local TV soap operas. Earlier this month, she sang at a three-day music festival in Kabul. Because social interaction between men and women is restricted, the musicians played for a female audience the first day and male the last two days. She is still not yet widely known among Afghans, but is breaking with tradition in a very conservative society, where some women do not go outside without wearing blue burqas. Violence against women is still common in Afghanistan, especially in remote areas. There are reports of women being stoned or executed in public for having affairs with men. Women accused of adultery have been killed or imprisoned. Risky business: Some of the young woman's own relatives will not speak to her. Pictured, Firooz records a track at a studio in Kabul . Firooz sings of ending 'all cruelty against women and children.' Her uncle has cut off contact with his family because of his niece, says her father, Abdul Ghafar Firooz. He has quit his job at the government-run electric department to accompany her whenever she leaves the house and protect her as she pursues her acting and musical career. 'I am her secretary, answering her phones,' he said. 'I am her bodyguard, protecting her. When she's out, I must be with her. 'Every parent must support their daughters and sons to help them progress.' Her mother, who does humanitarian work in conservative, remote areas of southern Afghanistan, is careful not to mention her daughter's budding career. Firooz says her family's support gives her 'the strength to fight against the problems in our society'. There are a few male rappers in Afghanistan, including 28-year-old Bejan Zafarmal - nicknamed DJ Besho - and some of their CDs can be bought in the Kabul bazaar. Firooz's first -and so far only - song was arranged by well-known Afghan singer and composer Fared Rastagar, who recently returned from living in Germany and has a recording studio in Kabul. 'I admire Sosan for her courage and appreciate the support of her family,' he said. 'Rap is needed here. We need to bring changes in all parts of life including music.' It might be a long road to stardom for Firooz She lives with her family in a mud brick house in a poor neighbourhood in north Kabul. She uses an old desktop computer to write music,and was given an electronic keyboard as a gift from one of her supporters. She does not have the money to make CDs or a more elaborate music video, but she is determined to keep going. 'When war started in our country, there were bullets, artillery, rockets,' she raps. 'All our trees were burned down. The war forced us to leave our country. 'We are hopeful for the future in our country. And we ask that our neighbouring countries leave us alone.' ...and her first music video here...","Sosan Firooz, 23, has rapped about the repression of women and her hopes for peace in her home country. She has to be accompanied by her father at all times when out for her own protection."

A Barclays manager has been jailed for stealing thousands of pounds from an elderly millionaire's account in the hope the customer would not notice the money was missing. Shaikh Khan, who handled hundreds of Premier accounts for a London branch's wealthiest customers, stole £10,000 from Jack Mautner - described as 'particularly old and vulnerable' - who had over £1million in his Barclays account. After taking the money, the 26-year-old manager tampered with Mr Mautner's account details to ensure he was not sent a statement and alerted to the missing cash. Deceit: Barclays manager Shaikh Khan handled hundreds of Premier accounts for wealthy customers . Khan, who worked in a Barclays branch on Oxford Street, also stole a further £10,000 from another customer, Lilia Vasilieva, who did not regularly check her account. The Old Bailey heard the scam was masterminded by Khan's friend Farah Mahmood, 26, and that the majority of the stolen cash was channeled through accounts belonging to Ali Bashir, another schoolfriend, also 26. Khan, who had previous convictions for dishonesty, first accessed Ms Vasilieva's account using a colleague's ID on January 13 2011, and transferred £5,000 to Bashir's account. He recorded the transfer as a 'face to face' transaction. He transferred another £5,000 on January 26. Khan changed the address on the account so Ms Vasilieva did not receive her statements, the court heard. Prosecutor Tim Devlin told the court Khan and a colleague visited Mr Mautner's home on January 26 to discuss a legitimate transfer of £50,000. 'Perhaps realising that Mr Mautner was very old, he decided to target a particularly old and vulnerable member of society,' he said. 'He must have seen how much was in that account and decided to have some of it for himself and his friends.' The court heard Khan had lied on his CV in order to get his Barclays job. Web of fraud: The scam was masterminded by Farah Mahmood, left, while the stolen cash was channeled through accounts belonging to Ali Bashir, right, the court heard . A judge at the Old Bailey described the three friends' 'web of fraud' as an offence which 'strikes at the heart of the banking system and one in which wealthy, elderly and vulnerable customers were preyed upon'. Khan, of Manor Park, east London, Mahmood, of East Ham, and Bashir, of Ealing, west London, had all denied conspiracy to steal between January 10, 2011, and February 25 2011, but were convicted by a jury. Khan had claimed he was acting under duress after being threatened by Mahmood. Judge Kramer said: 'This was a deliberately dishonest and targeted fraud. 'You, Mahmood, were at the centre of a web of fraud, arranging it and giving instructions to the others as to where the money should go. 'I am satisfied that you, Khan, abused your managerial position at that bank. You selected two accounts and withdrew £20,000.' The judge said Khan knew one account was 'rarely checked', and that the other contained a seven figure sum meaning the missing money would be 'a drop in the ocean'. Bashir's rolr was to act as a 'conduit' through whose account £15,000 of the stolen money was channeled, the judge added. Khan and Mahmood were each jailed for 18 months. Bashir was given a 12 month prison sentence suspended for two years.","Shaikh Khan, 26, handled hundreds of Premier accounts for a London branch's wealthiest customers.

86279,"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has opened up about his management style, using the analogy of making a suit to measure to describe his role, whilst also suggesting being a coach in England is ‘paradise’. The Blues boss, since returning to Chelsea in the summer of 2013, has assembled a star studded squad which is perched at the top of the Premier League and in the last 16 of the Champions League. Mourinho, who has won league titles in Portugal, Spain and Italy, insists you need to treat each player differently to harness their potential. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho talks to Sports Illustrated about his reign at Stamford Bridge . ‘To manage a player is like to make a suit by measure, because all of them are different I cannot go to a shop and buy some 38, some 40, some 42, some 44 and arrive in the dressing room. No. It has to be by measure, it has to be perfect,’ Mourinho told Sports Illustrated. ‘So the personal relationship with the players is something very very important. Obviously there is also the collective leadership and I have to try and adapt my collective leadership to the profile of group I have,’ added the Blues boss. ‘But I think the suit by measure is the perfect way to explain what I think is fundamental – every man is a man, I read them and the better I can interact with them the better the team can be.’ Mourinho watches on as his new recruit Juan Cuadrado (centre) control the ball at Stamford Bridge . Mourinho told Grant Wahl Chelsea have been a success in the transfer market because they don't panic . Chelsea had a strong summer in the transfer market with the acquisitions of Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic proving excellent additions and have propelled the Blues to the top of the Premier League. The 52-year-old puts his transfer success down to composure and research: . ‘First of all we didn’t panic. I came here in the first season (2013-14) and we decided not to buy just because we want to win desperately,’ added Mourinho. ‘If we have to wait one year ok, to be more sure about the profile of the type of player we want to bring. We had to be very sure of what we wanted to do. ‘After that it’s a lot easier not to make mistakes, analyse everything, try everything, know the players deeply, know if the players have the potential to improve or not under your guidance. Chelsea's midfielder Cesc Fabregas, a £30m summer signing, has been in fine form so far this season . ‘So when the summer market arrived we were in a great condition to make the right decisions to improve our team. Mourinho is clearly relishing life back in London despite disputes with officials and an apparent ‘campaign’ against his Chelsea side. ‘Firstly it’s paradise for the social life, In Europe the power of football made our lives complicated and in England people look at you in a normal way. You can walk in the street, shop with your family, go to a restaurant,’ said the Portuguese. ‘The social life is much more relaxed. There is an expression in England that the passion for the game lasts 90 minutes a week and after that everything is calm.’ The 52-year-old returned to the 'paradise' of coaching in  West London in the summer of 2013 .",Jose Mourinho has opened up about his management style at Chelsea.

'Just lost it': Former RAF sergeant Frederick Gilliard, 76, killed his wife with a garden gnome . An elderly ex-RAF sergeant who beat his wife to death with a garden gnome before stabbing her ten times was today jailed for four years. Frederick Gilliard, 76, said he 'just lost it' after a row with his wife Josephine, 74, to whom he had been married for 54 years. Mr Gillard, who called police to the couple's Blackpool home, told officers 'this is going to kill my kids, I loved that woman,' Preston Crown Court heard. The couple were described as a 'decent, hardworking couple' who raised four children and had three grandchildren. Members of his family wept in the public gallery as he was jailed. Mr Gilliard had also served in the RAF for 27 years including seeing active service during the conflict in Aden, and had previously suffered from depression. It was during a 'depressive episode' on February 5th last year, that Mr Gillard used a garden ornament shaped like an Easter Island statue, and an eight inch carving knife, to kill his wife, the court heard. Mrs Gilliard, 74, who was attacked in their bedroom, suffered ‘catastrophic’ head injuries and ten stab wounds of ‘considerable force’ to her neck, chest and stomach. He then dialled 999 telling the operator ‘I just lost it’ summoning police to the family home in Blackpool, Lancashire where his wife lay dead. When officers arrived he said: ‘I can’t believe it. This is going to kill my kids. We have been married 54 years. I loved that woman.’ Weapon: Mr Gillard used a garden gnome shaped like one of the famous Easter Island statues to kill his wife . Gilliard was originally charged with murder but at an earlier hearing pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to his depression. Passing sentence Judge Anthony Russell QC, Recorder of Preston, told the defendant: ‘This is a terrible tragedy which has affected all of your family and you, and must have inflicted considerable emotional damage which can never be repaired.’ Frail Gilliard, who walks with a stoop and wears glasses and hearing aids in both ears, could not hear proceedings and looked over to his family in the public gallery who held up four fingers to indicate the sentence.","Frederick Gillard, 76, killed his wife Josephine, 74, with a garden gnome.

In its heyday, it completed nine milestone missions - from launching the first female astronaut into space to taking part in the first repair of a satellite by an astronaut.

5312,"By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 03:55 EST, 14 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:58 EST, 14 December 2012 . The lyrics are familiar from a thousand nativity plays and Christmas carol services. But what do the words to Away In a Manger mean exactly? That is the question pondered by television historian Mary Beard after she attended this year's annual carol service at King's College, Cambridge. Confusion: Mary Beard, a professor in classics at Cambridge, wrote about the 'weird' Away In a Manger lyrics in a newspaper column . The historian, a professor in classics at Cambridge University, wrote about how she was struck by the phrase 'no crib for a bed' as she perused the lyrics printed in her order of service. Writing in her column in the Times Literary Supplement, Professor Beard said of the printed lyrics: 'It did make you reflect on what made a good carol, what was the right blend of sentimentality and jolliness. 'It also made you reflect on how weird some of the words were (what actually does ""no crib for a bed"" mean?),' she added. Carols: The historian attended this year's King's College carol service in Cambridge (file picture) The confusion is thought to arise from the fact that - at least in Britain - a crib and a manger are essentially the same thing; a trough from which an animal can eat fodder. Meaning interpreting the phrase 'away in a manger, no crib for a bed' could present something of a conundrum. But in the U.S., where the carol was first published in Philadelphia in 1885, a crib is defined as a small bed for infants and young children. One reader posted a reply to Professor Beard's column which said: 'I think we must apply a principle of charity and interpret the words in a way that makes them sensible. 'As a manger has just been mentioned, we must take ""crib"" to have only the meaning of a proper little bed designed for children.'","Cambridge historian Mary Beard was struck by the 'weird' lyrics at this year's annual carol service at King's College, Cambridge."
91723,"Jailed: Dana Amin, 33, from Mitcham, South London, has been jailed for his part in the 'honour killing' of Banaz Mahmod in 2006 . A cousin of an honour killing victim who helped dispose of her body has said he is proud of his actions. Banaz Mahmod, 20, was strangled to death with a shoelace by her father and uncle in her south London home, seven years ago. Her cousin Dana Amin, now 29, helped put the . young woman's body in a suitcase and transported it to the Midlands before burying it in a make-shift grave in a . Birmingham back-garden. As he was sentenced to eight years in prison, Amin told Southwark Crown Court he did not regret his actions. Iraq-born Banaz was murdered by members of her family because she walked out of an arranged marriage and fell in love with another man. Her father, Mahmod Mahmod, and uncle, . Ari Mahmod, were jailed for life in 2007, after being found guilty of what has become Britain’s most notorious honour . killing. On the eve of Banaz's death, Amin, a father-of-one, joined two other cousins, Mohammed Ali, and Omar Hussain, who were jailed in 2010 after being extradited from Iraq, at the former's Brixton home to discuss plans to kill her. Although none were convicted of Banaz's murder, the cousins later travelled to Birmingham in Amin’s black Lexus to help their uncles get rid of the 20-year-old's body. Banaz’s case highlighted the occurrence of honour killings in Britain, after her body was discovered in the Brimingham garden, three months after her disappearance. The young woman's nightmare began three years earlier, when she . agreed to an arranged-marriage to a Kurdish man, then . aged 28, who she later told police was ‘very strict'. She had met her . husband-to-be only three times before her wedding day and, according to . Banaz, her husband regularly . physically and sexually abused her. ‘When . he raped me it was like I was his shoe that he could wear whenever he . wanted to,’ she explained to police. ‘I didn't know if this was normal in my . culture, or here. I was 17.’ Murdered: Banaz was strangled to death with a shoe lace in her home in South London by her father and her uncle before three cousins were called in to help dispose of her body . Murder: The body of Banaz Mahmod was found inside this suitcase, three months after she has been buried in a Birmingham garden by three of her own cousins . The terrified young woman left her husband after two-and-a-half years, a decision that angered her family, who had arrived in Britain when Banaz was 12. After returning to her family home, she met and fell in love with Rahmat Sulemani, a family friend. Rahmat . would later give evidence at the trial, revealing that he and Banaz had . been threatened with death if they carried on seeing each other. The . mobile phone footage he took of Banaz when she was lying covered in . blood in a hospital bed, in an apparent earlier attempt to murder her, . was shown at the 2007 trial. The . lovers pretended they had parted after the shocking incident, but they . continued to meet in secret. They were spotted together in Brixton on . January 21 and the Mahmods were informed. Rahmat was kidnapped by four men who threatened to kill him. In fear of her life: Banaz Mahmod is seen telling officers that she believes her family intend to murder her during a police interview. She was killed in January 2006 . Harrowing: Banaz visited police five times asking for help, but nothing was done in time . When he phoned Banaz to warn her, she went to the police and said she would co-operate in bringing charges against her family and other members of the community. The . policewoman who saw Banaz tried to persuade her to go into a hostel or . safe house but she is thought to have seen her home as safe because . her mother was there. She returned to the family home and was murdered just days later. Despite denying any involvement in the plot, Amin was convicted by a jury yesterday following a week-long trial. Judge Martin Beddoe slammed the ‘perverted code’ followed by the killers which dictates a woman cannot do as she chooses. He told Amin: ‘I am quite satisfied that you knew well before she was murdered what was going to happen to your cousin.' Killers: Banaz's father Mahmod Mahmod, right, and her uncle Ari Mahmod, left, were jailed for life in 2007 . Jailed: Mahmod Mahmod was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his daughter . Judge . Beddoe added: 'Her . death had been planned for about a month or so before it actually took . place. There had even been an attempt on her life already. ‘I . am sure you were aware of all these matters and you knew not only of . what had gone on but what was intended to happen. I fear for any female . child you may father. ‘When I think of that girl in that suitcase in that hole . in the ground, I find it really hard to consider your family situation. ‘It is a reflection that you are again thinking of yourself and demonstrating a complete lack of remorse.’ Amin, . of Mitcham, south London, denied doing acts tending and intending to . pervert the course of public justice and preventing the lawful and . decent burial of a corpse. He . is about to become a father for the second time, and the court was told . he plans on joining his wife and sons in Iraq after he has served his . time.","Banaz Mahmod, 20, was strangled to death with a shoelace in her London home.

60419,"Iraqi lawmakers elected a Sunni politician as Parliament speaker Tuesday, finally taking a step to form a new government after two weeks of deadlock while the country faces a powerful Islamist militant insurgency. Lawmakers elected Salim al-Jabouri, the head of a Sunni coalition, as speaker of Iraq's Council of Representatives. The Iraqi Constitution mandates that the job go to a Sunni Muslim. The body also elected two deputy speakers. MAPS: Understanding the Iraq crisis . Al-Jabouri announced that lawmakers are accepting nominations for president, saying that there are three days to nominate and then the body will reconvene. The president must be Kurdish and the prime minister a Shiite. The body had convened July 1 to elect a new speaker, but the session quickly descended into bickering between members of different parties and had to be rescheduled for July 8. That session was delayed, and more arguing erupted. Under the constitution, the Parliament has 75 days from when it convenes to pick a prime minister. While lawmakers are under pressure to act quickly, the political body has had trouble moving swiftly in the past. The last time Parliament met to pick a prime minister, it took nearly 10 months. The quagmire persists even as fighters with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS -- a Sunni-dominated al Qaeda splinter group -- have overtaken large swaths of Iraq and Syria. The militants want to establish an Islamic state spanning both countries. President Barack Obama has authorized 300 military advisers in Iraq, 210 of which are there now. Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement of congratulation to Iraq for electing a speaker and deputy speakers. ""The election of a speaker is the first step in the critical process of forming a new government that can take into account the rights, aspirations, and legitimate concerns of all Iraq's communities,"" the statement read. ""We urge Iraq's leaders to follow this achievement with rapid formation of a new government pursuant to Iraq's constitutional timelines."" The statement urged the international community to support Iraq's ""democrative political process,"" adding that the ""stakes of Ira's future"" depend on its leaders to work together and stand against ISIS. Obama has ordered an assessment of Iraqi security forces, which was given Monday to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a Pentagon spokesman said. Pentagon officials will review the report that evaluates the capabilities, training, morale, leadership and command and control of Iraqi forces and then hand it to the President and give Obama their recommendations for the best next steps in supporting Iraq. Many Iraqi troops abandoned their posts and fled when faced with attacks from ISIS. Two U.S. officials told CNN this week that the administration is concerned about the overwhelming sectarianism among members of Iraq's security forces. American commanders are concerned if the United States moves into a direct advisory role of Iraqi government forces, it will be perceived as taking sides with the Iranian-backed Shiite elements inside Iraqi units. In Syria, ISIS continues to gain ground. As of Monday, the group controlled about 95% of the eastern province of Deir Ezzor, which borders Iraq, according to the UK-based opposition group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

58232,"By . Associated Press . Flanked by bargain-priced displays of women's wear and patio lighting, President Barack Obama came to a Wal-Mart store in Silicon Valley on Friday to praise new steps by businesses and communities to deploy solar energy. The President was showcasing efforts to combat climate change that don't rely on a disinclined Congress. But in choosing the giant retailer as . the backdrop for his announcement, Obama also triggered a backlash from . labor unions and pay equity advocates who say low wages paid by Wal-Mart . fly in the face of Obama's vaunted push on pay equity. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama poses for a photo after speaking at a Walmart store in Mountain View, California on Friday . 'What . numbskull in the White House arranged this?' former Labor Secretary . Robert Reich, who served in the Bill Clinton administration, said on . Facebook. Obama said more . than 300 companies and state and local governments have pledged to use . solar technology, and he unveiled his own executive actions aimed at . increasing energy efficiency with a goal of reducing U.S. reliance on . carbon fuels. The two tracks underscored Obama's . strategy of sidestepping Congress to advance his own agenda, but they . also illustrated the limits of his reach in a bitterly divided . government. 'The commitments . we're announcing today prove that there are cost-effective ways to . tackle climate change and create jobs at the same time,' Obama said at a . sprawling Wal-Mart store in Mountain View. President Barack Obama speaks at a Walmart store in Mountain View, California, on Friday . The solar effort will power the equivalent of 130,000 homes, the White House said, while Obama's administrative actions could reduce carbon pollution in an amount equal to taking 80 million cars off the road for one year. The White House also announced that long-delayed energy efficiency standards for walk-in coolers and freezers have finally been completed. Ticking off a list of economic and environmental benefits he attributed to solar technology, Obama cast the commitments as part of a broader campaign to reduce American energy dependence, create jobs in renewable energy and lower heat-trapping emissions blamed for global warming. 'This is what you call a win-win-win,' Obama told about 250 store employees as he wrapped up a three-day swing through California focused heavily on raising money for Democrats in advance of November's midterm elections. Obama announced new steps by companies, local governments and his own administration to deploy solar technology . Tweaking the mostly Republican opponents of his energy policies in Congress, Obama lamented that lawmakers have 'not always been as visionary on these issues as we would like.' That's why he's seizing opportunities this year to act unilaterally to advance those goals, Obama said. 'Unfortunately, inside of Washington, we still have some climate deniers who shout loud,' Obama said. 'But they're wasting people's time on a settled debate.' His policies unable to generate momentum in Congress, Obama has increasingly gone outside the federal government to press his agenda. He has won commitments from colleges and universities to expand access to more students; he has created innovation hubs that link businesses and education institutions; and he has drawn attention to companies and state and local governments that have increased pay for workers. President Barack Obama waves after speaking at the Walmart store . Still, that choice of tactics has severely limited what Obama may be able to accomplish, a reality the president acknowledged the night before as he spoke to donors at a fundraiser in La Jolla benefiting House Democrats. 'Regardless of how hard I push, regardless of how many administrative actions I take, we're not going to be able to go where we need to go, and can go, and should go unless I've got a Congress that's willing to work with me,' Obama said. The White House said it chose Wal-Mart because the company has committed to doubling the number of solar energy projects at its stores, Sam's Clubs and distribution centers. The Wal-Mart location he visited gets about 15 percent of its power from solar panels. Wal-Mart's president, Bill Simon, said. Obama is the first president to visit one of the chain's warehouse stores.","The White House said more than 300 companies and state and local governments have pledged to use solar technology.

They’re fierce predators that rip flesh from bones using razor sharp teeth and strangle their prey, yet new video footage shows lions being as playful as household cats. Captured by lion whisperer and zoologist Kevin Richardson, 39, in Pretoria, South Africa, the footage was filmed using GoPro camera fitted to his back. Richardson even managed to attach the camera to the back of a lioness to give a unique viewpoint of the large cats' prowl. Scroll down for video . The lions caught on camera are 10 years old. In one shot, zoologist Kevin Richardson shouts ‘Maggie’ as one of lions bounds towards him before leaping into his arms, pictured . While hand-held footage additionally captures amazing close-up shots of hyenas walking across the plains. In an exclusive interview, Richardson told MailOnline he’s been working with the big cats for 16 years. ‘I’ve always been passionate about animals of all shapes and sizes. I got the opportunity to work with two male lion cubs 16 years back and was bitten by the bug. ‘I’ve been very privileged to have been accepted into the lives of many different lions over the years and and also to raise awareness to the plight of lions in the wild and their dwindling numbers.’ Watch the full 14-minute video here. The lions caught on camera are 10 years old, according to Richardson.

This close relationship meant Richardson was also able to attach the cameras to the back of the lions. Richardson told MailOnline: ‘We filmed with a GoPro team over several days and I’ve used the [camera] with the lions so they are accustomed to posing. ‘I only put cameras on the backs of lions who I knew potentially wouldn't mind them.

Rose, 36, sunk five birdies in the last seven holes in his five-under-par 67 to join Garcia, who hit 70, on six under.
Rickie Fowler finished a shot back, while Jordan Spieth carded a 68 to move level with fellow Americans Charley Hoffman and Ryan Moore on four under.
Lee Westwood (68) moved to one under while Rory McIlroy (71) is level par.
Rose is one of four previous major winners in the top 10 going into Sunday's final round, which will be live and uninterrupted on BBC Two from 18:30 BST.
Garcia, Fowler and England's Westwood are all hoping to finally land one of golf's four most prestigious tournaments.
Olympic champion Rose, 36, has not claimed a major since his maiden triumph at the 2013 US Open, but lifted himself into contention for a first Masters title with a stunning finish on Saturday.
The Englishman, who has four previous top-10 finishes at the Augusta National, was level par for the round after 11, only to blitz the final seven holes.
He rolled in a 20-foot birdie putt at the 17th, then a 10-footer at the last, to join Hoffman in the lead.

Garcia, playing alongside the 40-year-old Californian, birdied the 15th to briefly make it a three-way tie at the top.
But Hoffman, one of four to share the overnight lead after the second round, slipped behind Rose and Garcia after finding water on the par-three 16th and ending with a double bogey.
""The key for me was staying patient early in my round. For me the test was around six when I made bogey, I stayed with it and played well on the back nine. Everything clicked into gear,"" said Rose.
""Patience is the key on Sunday. This is a golf course where you have to pick your moments. That will be the game plan.""
Two-time major winner Spieth is hoping to banish memories of last year's spectacular final-day collapse by winning his second Masters.
And the 23-year-old Texan, who has finished second, first and tied second in his three Augusta appearances, put himself in the frame again with a nerveless third-round display.
After an opening-round 75 which featured a quadruple-bogey nine on the 15th, Spieth was 10 shots adrift of leader Hoffman.
No previous Masters winner has trailed by more than seven shots after 18 holes.
Spieth, who recovered with a three-under 69 on Friday, started his third round with five pars, but three birdies in four holes before the turn catapulted him into contention.
Further birdies at 13 and 15 moved him into outright second, only for a bogey on 16 - his first in 30 holes - to drop him back into a share for fourth.
""We wanted to shoot four under and thought if we did the lead would move to six or seven and I'd creep on it,"" said the 2015 champion, who is bidding to become the youngest two-time Masters winner.
""Moments present themselves on Sunday here - it is about being patient.
""I know better than anyone what can happen on a Sunday.""
World number eight Fowler putted solidly on his way to a hard-fought one-under-par 71, while Moore responded to the grief of losing his grandmother earlier this week with six birdies in a three-under 69.
Like Garcia, Worksop's Westwood has long been considered one of Europe's finest players, only to have an excellent career somewhat tarnished by the absence of a major title.
And the 43-year-old, who was third after an opening-round 70, appeared to have scuppered his chances of ending that long wait following a five-over 77 on Friday.
However, he is back with an outside chance after converting six birdies in a four-under-par 68.
""Obviously I would like to be deep in the red, but one under is pretty good,"" said Westwood, who finished tied second with Spieth last year.
""I've got half a chance if I can get a roll going on the front nine.""

World number two McIlroy's hopes of becoming only the sixth man to win all four majors look slim.
The Northern Irishman, 27, made a strong start with birdies on the second and third, only to be set back by three-putts on the fifth and seventh which cost him a bogey and double bogey.
Further birdies on the eighth and 12th provided hope, but he could not add any more to close the gap on the leaders.
""I had some chances on the back nine that I could have converted,"" said the four-time major winner.
""I think I probably could have shot a 67 or 68, but I had just a few too many wasted opportunities.
""I'm going to need my best score around here, 65, to have a chance.""

Too young: 50-year-old celebrity mixologist Darryl Robinson (here with Dr. Oz) was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment Wednesday from unknown causes . 'At learning of this morning's sad news, our thoughts go out to Darryl Robinson's family & friends,' tweeted a Cooking Channel spokesperson Wednesday morning. Robinson appeared on his own show called Drink Up in which he taught viewers how to create simple but creative cocktails. After the show was not renewed after the 2010 season, Robinson made the television rounds with appearances alongside Wendy Williams, on VH1's Morning Buzz and on Access Hollywood. He really worked at making himself a brand and made a career out of it,' his friend Maggie Mistal told the New York Daily News. 'Everybody is just as shocked as I am. We’re all confused.' TV personality: Robinson had his own Cooking Channel show in 2010 called Drink Up. Though it was not renewed by the network after one season, the native Long Islander became known on the talk show circuit for his creative cocktails . Robinson was not classically trained in mixology and said on his website that all he knew he learned 'in the trenches.' For the native Long Islander, those trenches were--at least in part--in the once super trendy but now defunct Hudson Bar. Robinson's last post on his website was a Super Bowl mezcal cocktail on February 1. Autopsy results were still pending Wednesday afternoon. Unknown causes: Robinson went on to appear on the Wendy Williams Show, VH1 and on Hollywood Insider.

Brook, 28, retained his IBF belt on Saturday and wants a bout with Khan, also 28, who has opted to fight American Chris Algieri next.
""Khan has no respect for me and looks down his nose at me, but I've done everything asked of me,"" said Brook.
""I'm an unbeaten world champion and deserve and command respect but he talks to me like I'm nothing.""
Brook added: ""If someone said to me you can get five million quid, a world title, fight at Wembley with a fight that every fan wants to see, it's a no-brainer for me.""
Khan, a former world champion at light-welterweight, has expressed a desire to fight Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao in the future, but has said he may fight Brook ""inside the next 12 months"".
However, Sheffield-based Brook, who has won all 34 of his professional fights, expressed his surprise at Khan's choice of Algieri as an opponent and told BBC Sport: ""Khan is now fighting in my division and has not had many fights there as he used to fight at a lower weight.
""But now he thinks he can jump the gun and fight Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao before me, when I have earned the right to do so. I don't know who he thinks he is. It's about ego for him.
""Every fight fan in Britain and across the world wants to see me and Khan fight. We have a great rivalry, there's a big pot of money for him and it is for a world title. All they have to do is pick up the phone, but he doesn't want it.""
On Twitter, Khan defended his choice of opponent and said: ""Can everyone please wake up. I said the fight between me and Kell Brook will happen. When I think it's right. Look at who he fought last [Romanian Jo Jo Dan].
""Seems to me Kell Brook is dying to fight me for the big pay day before he faces a half decent opponent and loses that IBF title.
""Algieri [only beaten once by Pacquiao and still 140lbs WBO world champion] is still a better opponent than No No Dan.""
Two weeks after beating American Shawn Porter in California to win the IBF world welterweight title in August, Brook was stabbed in the leg in an ""unprovoked attack""  while on holiday in Tenerife.
""The toughest time was lying in a Tenerife hospital with no-one speaking English, next to a window with the sun beating down and my leg tied up, thinking I would never box again or even walk again,"" Brook revealed.
""It took every bit of shine off winning the world title. It was then about taking baby steps and it was a long road to come back.
""I was staring death in the face so there's no man that can worry me now. It was the toughest fight of my life.""
""Amir Khan is a very good fighter, but he has been knocked out a few times when he has stepped up,"" said Brook.
""Timing beats speed and I'm very strong at my weight. I'm big, accurate, powerful, determined and very eager to land my shots on his chin.
""He has always been the golden boy since doing well in the amateurs and has had that tag above his head.
""He's been on this television show and that television show and that's great if you're a celebrity but I'm about hardcore boxing. He has so many million followers on Twitter and beating him would be a massive boost to my profile.
""Khan's team want him to fight Mayweather or Pacquiao for the money as if he gets beat he can still fight me. But if he fights me and loses he has got nowhere to go.""
American Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao from the Philippines hold the other versions of the world welterweight title and fight in Las Vegas on 2 May.
""I think Floyd Mayweather will beat Manny Pacquiao. Mayweather has the desire to win, he has never lost, he controls his fights and is on a real high,"" said Brook.
""Mayweather is about securing a legacy and he wants to win all the belts. So if he wins, I would be a strong favourite to fight him. I would go into the fight 100% thinking I can win.""
""I think of Prince Naseem Hamed, Chris Eubank, Nigel Benn, Frank Bruno and Lennox Lewis and I'm not in front of them yet, but I want to leave a legacy and have exciting fights,"" Brook added.
""At the moment Carl Froch is leading the way for British boxers. but he won't be here for ever and next to him is me. Everyone else is below me.""","Kell Brook says he is a ""hardcore boxer"" who wants to fight Amir Khan at Wembley."
84263,"By . Snejana Farberov . Not-so average Joe: Joe Cornell, 52, a homeless recovering meth addict, returned a bag filled with $125,000 in cash after it fell off an armored truck . Joe Cornell, a recovering meth addict living in a Salvation Army rehab center, only had a $1 to his name Wednesday when he came upon a bag of money that fell off an armored truck. Instead of pocketing the $125,000 that Cornell, of Fresno, California, discovered when he opened the package, the down-on-his luck homeless man did the right thing - and returned all of it. A day later, Cornell was handsomely rewarded for his honesty when the security company Brinks, whose truck was transporting the misplaced money, gave the homeless man a debit card with $5,000 on it. 'Mr. Cornell did the right thing,' Brinks spokesman Ed Cunningham told The Fresno Bee. 'For that, we are grateful.' Cornell, 52, a married father of two with four grandchildren, has been staying at a Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Center in Fresno while trying to kick his crystal meth habit. On Wednesday morning, Cornell was watering plants in the yard when he witnessed a Brinks armored vehicle pull over at a red light on Venture Avenue nearby. Scroll down for video . Windfall: The pile of deposit money tumbled off a Brinks vehicle (similar to the one pictured) Struggling with demons: Cornell, 52, has been staying at a Fresno Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Center for the past four months while trying to kick a meth habit . Cornell overheard a motorist yell something to the driver of the Brinks truck, but the vehicle took off. The homeless grandfather walked over to the intersection for a closer look, and that is when he found a deposit bag stuffed with cash, the station KMPH reported. Even though Cornell had just a single dollar bill in his pocket for lunch that day, his first thought was that the pile of cash that fell into his lap likely belonged to businesses, and that keeping it could hurt innocent workers and their families. Cornell also had his grandchildren on his mind when he made the decision not to give in to temptation. ‘I thought, “What type of man do I want my grandkids to think I am?”’ Cornell told KMPH. ‘I want them to think I’m a just man that does the right thing and I did the right thing.’ The Salvation Army volunteer then alerted his supervisor, rehab program director Kayo Loveless, that he had found a small fortune and wanted to return it. ‘I went down there carrying the bag like I was Santa Claus,’ Cornell recalled. ‘It was heavy.’ When Cornell told his wife, Virginia, about what happened, the woman wept because she was so proud of her husband. The family plan to use Mr Cornell’s $5,000 reward from Brinks to pay off their debts. 'This is like a new start for us,' Mrs Cornell said. Honesty rewarded: Cornell (left) was given $5,000 by Brinks for returning the money; his wife, Virginia Cornell (right), says they will use the reward money to pay off their debts . Fresh start: The married couple, who have two children and four grandchildren, are looking forward to moving back together after Cornell's graduation from the Salvation Army program . Since the story broke earlier this week, people have been stopping by the shelter to give Cornell donations - or simply shake his hand. The security company also donated $5,000 to the rehabilitation center where Cornell has been staying for the past four months. Joe Cornell is expected to graduate from the Salvation Army program in July. He said that he is now clean and is looking for a job. ‘Anyone that needs an honest man to hire, we know that he's an honest man,’ said his wife. ‘He just gave back $125,000 that wasn't his.’ KMPH FOX 26 | Central San Joaquin Valley News Source .","Joe Cornell, 52, found a bag full of cash that fell off a Brinks truck while watering plants in his Fresno, California, home.

41658,"Rena was playing on her lounge floor, in her mother's lap, when the shot tore through her cheek. She grimaced, cried for her mother and then went silent, as the blood began to flow in her mouth. The bullet came from nowhere, bursting through the frosted-glass window on the family balcony, knocking out one of her teeth, and shattering her family's world. But in Aleppo, their ordeal had just begun because the struggle here is always to find medical help, fast. Her neighbor -- the women looking after Rena can't leave their home unaccompanied by male relatives -- then rushed her to the street, carrying her body. That's when we saw him, the sight of a man carrying a limp girl still striking even amid the daily atrocities of Aleppo. He flagged down a truck and they began to race towards the hospital. We followed, unsure what had happened. After a minute, the neighbor noticed us and clearly decided our car might move through the traffic faster. He stopped the truck he was in, leapt out and ran towards us, Rena bleeding in his arms, and screamed for help. Inside Syria: Bombs, road blocks and ice cream . He threw Rena onto the back seat and told us to race to the hospital, saying, ""Guys, she's choking."" Amid the traffic and blast of our horns, the sound of Rena's struggle to breathe was clear. A sucking sound, coupled with a gargle. The blood was flowing down her cheeks. Her neighbor screamed out of the window for cars to pass. After a minute that seemed to creep by, the car arrived at the hospital. Dar Al'Shifa sees trauma every hour in many forms. But a child shot in the face still causes doctors to jolt. They raced her into the back emergency room and began to work on her face. The bullet had entered her mouth cleanly but had torn up the other side of her mouth. Soon it became clear they thought she would live. She was breathing more easily. The bandages made the wounds seem less severe. But one problem remained. Dar Al'Shifa is in rebel territory where medical supplies are exhausted and hard to replenish. The decisions doctors take daily defy belief. In Rena's case, she could not get the surgery on her face she clearly needed there, so the doctors dared to think the unthinkable, and sent her across the front lines to the better equipped government hospital. She was piled into a truck and then vanished. The women who were caring for her when the bullet struck -- her grandmother and mother -- were still at home trying to understand what had happened. On the stairs up to the apartment was Rena's blood. Inside the apartment was her tooth. In the window was the small hole that the bullet had made. More than 100,000 refugees flee Syria in one month . A military-trained safety adviser working with the CNN crew assessed the hole made by the bullet and the trajectory when it hit Rena. It was clear to him that it must have been fired from one of the high apartment blocks opposite Rena's home. These buildings are inside rebel territory, but snipers -- particularly those working for the infamous pro-government militia known as the Shabeeha -- are thought to work inside rebel-held areas, and few could explain why the Free Syrian Army would shoot into areas that were sympathetic to it. The glass through which the bullet passed was frosted, meaning the gunman would not have seen exactly who were his targets. But the deliberate nature of how indiscriminate this was made it all the more chilling. The family members were, at that time, calm. They believed that Rena was getting the best of care and prepared for their hazardous trip to government territory to see her. It seemed like there had been a miraculous escape. The next morning, we returned. Locals in the street broke the news to us. Rena was dead. It was hard to believe that the girl we had seen recover, and who appeared so free from the bullet that should have killed her, had died from her wounds. The family refused to speak to us at first. We were told the father was angry we had entered the home and feared reprisals. After an hour, one relative met us outside. They said Rena had been rushed to two government hospitals. At each, they said, doctors had tried to help her. At each, they failed. It appears the bullet, which we did not find inside their home, had lodged inside her throat. A sniper's bullet had killed a four-year-old girl, leaving us wondering how the violence now engulfing Aleppo will ever end, whether its civilians will ever recover life as they knew it. Syria faces societal fissures .","A bullet tore through the cheek of a girl in her mother's lap in Aleppo. She was rushed to a government hospital, but was rushed to an emergency room.

52337,"By . Kirk Maltais . Pictures of a terrifying supercell storm that hit New Mexico on Saturday were captured, depicting the awesome size of the monolithic stormclouds. The storm rolled through Cuervo, New Mexico, producing hailstones that were four-inches in diameter. Cuervo is a community located approximately two hours away from Albuquerque. The state issued tornado warnings for the area for the weekend, but this did not stop some adventurous photographers from capturing the event. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a supercell, which is not always a thunderstorm, is a weather phenomenon in which converging low level winds create an updraft which rotates on a vertical axis. This is also known as a mesocyclone. Warm air in the mesocyclone can rise as fast as 170 miles per hour. Supercells are known to create large hailstones, damaging winds, and tornadoes, and can last for hours if conditions permit. These kind of storms can take place anywhere in the world, but are most commonly found in the midwest of the United States, as well as the plains areas in South America. Forecasters are calling for more severe weather to hit regions of New Mexico and Texas on Sunday. A storm spotter watches the looming storm over Cuervo, New Mexico.

57825,"By . Sam Webb . PUBLISHED: . 13:33 EST, 14 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:35 EST, 14 March 2013 . Contaminant: Westminster Council has removed a food supplier after it was discovered that pork DNA was discovered in Halal chicken sausages that were eaten by pupils. File picture . Pork DNA has been found in Halal chicken sausages that have been served in at least one primary school, Westminster Council said today. Other tests revealed that lean minced beef supplied to the council showed evidence of lamb and pork DNA. The council said it immediately ensured both items were removed from all school menus and had instructed its contractor to temporarily cease supplying meat until the issue was resolved. The consumption of pork is forbidden under Islamic law. Westminster City Council have named the school involved as St Mary’s Bryanston Square, a Church of England school in west London. In the meantime, the council said it had asked its contractor to no longer use its Halal meat supplier. The problem came to light after the authority decided to carry out its own proactive tests on food contamination in the wake of the horse meat scandal. The council said officers took seven samples in total from three schools in the week beginning February 25, adding that the tests 'were carried out on our own initiative and not carried out as the result of any specific concerns about school food standards'. The testing, which involved analysis for the presence of DNA from beef, lamb, pork, chicken, turkey, goat and horse, all proved negative for horse DNA. However, a preliminary report received on Friday suggested pig DNA could be present in the Halal chicken sausages range. The result was found in one sample taken at a Westminster primary school. A further round of tests today confirmed the preliminary findings. The Halal sausages were a menu choice in 15 primary schools, two nurseries, one special school and one pupil referral unit, all of which took Halal-only meat. The lean minced beef was used in 18 schools. The authority said it had launched its own investigation to establish how the contamination arose. Westminster City Council’s tri-borough director of children’s services Andrew Christie said: 'We are very concerned by the discovery that a contractor has fallen short of the high standards we demand. St Mary's Bryanston Square Primary School, where the chicken Halal sausages containing pork DNA were served . We also understand and regret the upset that may have been caused to parents and children alike. We are contacting schools, parents and faith group leaders and are offering to meet them to discuss their concerns. 'Westminster City Council took prompt action when this issue came to light and immediately ensured this product stopped being served in the schools in question. We have asked our contractor Chartwells to no longer use the meat supplier involved. 'The discovery of pork in these sausages came about because of extra tests Westminster City Council decided to carry out. The results were all the more shocking given the assurances about the food we receive from our suppliers. Other tests revealed that lean minced beef supplied to Westminster Council showed evidence of lamb and pork DNA. File picture . 'I can assure parents we will keep testing our school meals.' The council said it alerted the Food Standards Agency on March 11 in accordance with the usual protocols for incidents of this kind. A Defra spokesperson said: 'It is totally unacceptable if food labelled as Halal has been found to contain pork. 'Today Defra, the Food Standards Agency, and DCLG met with organisations involved in Halal and Kosher food to discuss labelling, and certification. Tesco Everyday Value beefburgers were removed after it was discovered they contained horse meat . 'Food manufacturers and suppliers have a responsibility to make sure that the food they serve is what they say it is. The FSA is working with Westminster City Council to establish what happened.' Last month the Ministry of Justice suspended a prison meat supplier after it was discovered that Halal pies and pasties may have contained traces of pork DNA. Aldi has withdrawn its Oakhurst Frozen Meatloaf after it was found to contain horse meat . The meat had been sourced from a properly Halal certificated caterer, however an investigation showed that the products could have contained traces of non-Halal meat, including pork. In a separate development, supermarket chain Aldi said a random sample of its Oakhurst Frozen Meatloaf had been found to contain horse meat. An Aldi spokesman said: 'Aldi has been contacted by the FSA to alert us that a random sample of our Oakhurst Frozen Meatloaf tested by a local authority has been found to contain horse meat. 'We are surprised and deeply disappointed at this news. Our DNA testing, carried out last month in accordance with FSA guidance, also tested samples of this product and found it to be clear of horse meat. 'The product is not part of our main range of everyday products and was stocked on a limited availability basis. However, we have immediately withdrawn any of the remaining stock from our stores. 'We will continue to test products and if we have any reason to believe the meat content is not correct, we will continue to act immediately in the interests of our customers. 'Customers can return the frozen meatloaf to their nearest Aldi for a full refund.' A number of revelations about contaminated meat products has emerged since the recent scandal over horsemeat contamination. Tesco was forced to issue a public apology earlier in January after tests in Ireland discovered traces of horse meat in three frozen beefburger lines. Scandal: A UK lab testing beef products says that nine out of 15 samples in one batch contained horse, as well as lamb, chicken and pork in a scandal linked to abattoirs like this one in Romania . The findings sparked a national outcry and 10 million burgers were pulled from shelves as a result of the scandal. Other supermarkets and major brands were also discovered to have horse DNA in their products and it soon emerged that horsemeat had been served to children in school meal cottage pies. It was also revealed that some hospitals have been serving patients burgers which contain horse passed off as beef. And the Whitbread chain announced that burgers and lasagne served at its Beefeater, Brewers Fayre, Table Table, Taybarns and Premier Inn hotels were contaminated.

57489,"Arizona spent two hours killing death row inmate Joseph Wood  this week, an unusually long time for an execution. Wood's death has reopened the debate about capital punishment and lethal injection. Lethal injection is used in all 32 states that have the death penalty. Some witnesses said Wood was gasping for breath and seemed to be in pain. Others said he was simply snoring. The state of Arizona said Wood didn't suffer. Either way, there are renewed concerns that executions, which are supposed to be quick and painless, are neither. Typically executions are performed using three drugs in stages. The first drug is an anesthetic. The second drug is called a paralytic and the third drug is supposed to stop the heart. For years, executioners used a drug called sodium thiopental as the first drug, the anesthetic, until the only U.S. producer of the drug stopped making it. Then the United States turned to European manufacturers, but they refused to sell the drug for use in executions. Since sodium thiopental was taken off the market for executions, states have turned to a drug called midazolam for the anesthetic. But experts believe there have been problems with the drug in at least three executions. The problems described by witnesses included gasping, snorting or choking sounds and, in one execution, the inmate was described as speaking. Wood was injected with midazolam on Wednesday, as well as hydromorphone, a narcotic painkiller that, with an overdose, halts breathing and stops the heart from beating. It is one of the new combinations that states have tried, with some controversial results. What would qualify as a botched execution? Michael Radelet, a professor of sociology and law, said an execution is botched when it looks like the inmate endured ""prolonged suffering"" for 20 minutes or more. Whether they're ""botched"" or not, plenty of executions don't go by the book. Most of the executions listed here were compiled by Human Rights Watch. Dennis McGuire, executed January 16, 2014, in Ohio. Columbus Dispatch reporter Alan Johnson said the execution process took 24 minutes, and that McGuire appeared to be gasping for air for 10 to 13 minutes. He had been injected with midazolam and hydromorphone, a two-drug combination that hadn't been used before in the United States. McGuire, 53, was convicted in 1994 in the rape and murder of a 22-year-old pregnant woman. Clayton Lockett, executed April 29, 2014, in Oklahoma. Lockett was injected with midazolam, but instead of becoming unconscious, he twitched, convulsed and spoke. The execution was halted, but Lockett died after 43 minutes. A team that prepared Lockett for execution failed to set a properly functioning IV in his leg, according to preliminary findings of an independent autopsy. Lockett was convicted in the 1999 death of an Oklahoma woman who was buried alive after she was raped and shot. Jose High, executed November 7, 2001, in Georgia. This execution illustrates a common problem. The execution team had trouble finding a usable vein and spent 39 minutes looking before finally sticking a needle into High's hand. A second needle was inserted between his neck and shoulder by a physician. Sixty-nine minutes after the execution began, he was pronounced dead. High was convicted in a 1976 store robbery and the kidnapping and murder of an 11-year-old boy. Claude Jones, executed December 7, 2000, in Texas. The execution team spent 30 minutes looking for a suitable vein, a difficult task because of Jones' history of drug abuse. He was convicted in the 1990 murder of a liquor store owner. Joseph Cannon, executed April 23, 1998, in Texas.  The needle popped out and Cannon said to witnesses, ""It's come undone."" The needle was reinserted and 15 minutes later a weeping Cannon made his second final statement. He was convicted of murder. John Wayne Gacy, executed May 10, 1994,  in Illinois. Lethal chemicals solidified and clogged in the IV tube leading to Gacy's arm. A new tube was installed and  the execution proceeded. Gacy, one of America's most notorious killers, was convicted in 1980 of raping and killing 33 boys and young men he lured into his home. Charles Walker, executed September 12, 1990, in Illinois. The execution was prolonged because a kink in the plastic tubing stopped the flow of chemicals into Walker's body and an intravenous needle pointed at Walker's fingers, instead of his heart, said a Missouri State Prison engineer hired to assist in the execution. Walker was convicted of two counts of murder. Raymond Landry, executed December 13, 1988, in Texas. The catheter dislodged and flew through the air two minutes after injection of drugs into Landry's body. The execution team spent 14 minutes inserting it again and Landry was pronounced dead 40 minutes after being strapped to the gurney. He had been convicted of murder.","Lethal injection is used in all 32 states that have the death penalty. Human Rights Watch says botched executions are rare. Problems include gasping, snorting or choking sounds, experts say."
69472,"Tamika Morrison and Joi Disroe knew each other for several months before they met in person. But, when they finally did connect, it was as if they had known each other for much longer. ""The emotion was so genuine,"" Morrison said of their first encounter. ""When she looked at me, she looked like she saw a friend of hers that she had not seen in a long time."" The two met at a gathering for Atlanta-area ""pinners,"" the name fans use to pledge their allegiance to Pinterest, the popular Internet pinboard. As the online community swells with more and more people sharing images of dream homes, extravagant food and inspirational phrases, pinners are forging connections in real-life at fan parties such as May's ""Perfect Pinterest Party"" in Atlanta. The gatherings also offer an opportunity to capture a slice of Pinterest's audience in one room at a time: women of all colors, sizes and income brackets and a few well-dressed men. Many have dozens of boards and hundreds, if not thousands of pins, that they use for a variety of purposes, from sharing and storing recipe and decor inspiration to networking and creating their own brand. From pins to projects: Pinterest in real life . Pinterest has organized several meet-ups in the past year in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, which drew guests from San Diego and even as far as Mexico. The Atlanta event was unique because pinners from the area hatched and planned the event on their own. Besides donating T-shirts and promoting the event on social media, Pinterest had no hand in directly organizing it. ""This party and other parties of this nature are truly an amazing effort by the Pinners themselves,"" a Pinterest spokeswoman said in an e-mail. The self-driven model is gaining ground. Pinners are known to host get-togethers in homes or organize outings based around activities and recipes discovered via Pinterest. And, because they already have one passion (or several) in common, striking up small talk at these events can be a little easier than meeting up with perfect strangers. The parties are opportunities to meet others whose taste these pinners admire from afar. Melanie Woodroffe, who admits to being ""pin-obsessed,"" started planning the Atlanta event in February with the goal of bringing pinners together to benefit a local nonprofit. It turned out to be an easy sell for Pinterest, which contributed giveaways for a raffle, and for local sponsors, who donated free food and drinks. She found the perfect venue in craft store Re-inspiration, a converted house that sells recycled goods by local artists, from wind chimes and jewelry made of glass bottles to driftwood wall signs bearing inspirational phrases. ""Re-inspiration represents a live version of Pinterest,"" Woodroffe, who wore a gray Pinterest T-shirt as she greeted visitors outside the store. ""It is creative and community-based, and I love that. [It] reminded me why I love Pinterest so much!"" It was a no-brainer for the store's owner, Brooke Schultze, an avid pinner who promotes items from the store on her boards. Interest, meet Pinterest: Site helps users catalog their passions . ""The idea was to form a community around Pinterest in Atlanta that extends beyond just sitting behind a computer [and] into the community to see actual things that are featured on Pinterest, "" Schultze said. Guests walked up stairs to an enclosed porch, where a table of red velvet and rum raisin cake balls awaited them, courtesy of ""Kheesecake"" baker Kelli Fair. Past the colorful wooden birdhouses and lawn decorations of corrugated metal, another table offered vases of M&Ms and popcorn in a nod to the ""vase-as-a-vessel-for-other-items"" motif popular on Pinterest. Several guests remarked that they had seen the sausage cheddar balls on Pinterest as well. Initially, guests moved around tentatively in groups of two and three, taking pictures with smart phones and iPads of store goods and pinning them. As time passed and drinks were imbibed, people began mingling. Joi Disroe was milling among the crowd when she recognized Tamika Morrison from photos on her boards. Disroe, who owns a catering business with her husband, wanted to put a real face to the person whose images of food and ""tablescapes"" she frequently ""liked"" or commented on. Morrison started following Disroe's ""Haute Kitchen"" board after seeing a blog image of a kitchen with black cabinetry accented with a gray, heavily distressed island and wood floors. ""When I look at her pins, I think, 'that kitchen could be my kitchen,' "" said Morrison, a public relations professional who runs her own boutique agency. ""Pinning is about creating a place to escape to, a perfect world around whatever the topic is. She gives me photos that I can bring to my collection."" The two shared a laugh over the odd familiarity of the relationship and talked about each other's pins before parting ways, feeling as if they had just reconnected with an old friend. ""It reminded me of the importance to still connect face-to-face with people, but the cool part was that social media, pinning to be exact, was the commonality we shared,"" Morrison. ""Instead of the usual 'hello, I'm so-and-so, what do you do?' it was more like, 'Oh! You're so-and-so!!! I love the picture you posted the other day,"" she said. ""It was a very cool experience and shows just how social media has influenced the way we connect."" Pinterest not manly enough for you? Try these sites, bro .

47504,"A ruthless drug smuggler known as the 'Godmother of Cocaine' who was jailed in the U.S. for three chilling murders has been gunned down by a motorcycle-riding hitman. Griselda Blanco, 69, was believed to have ordered dozens of executions during the notorious 'cocaine cowboys' era of the 1970s and 80s in Miami. In a grim irony, the mode of her killing was eerily similar to the brutal drive-by killings she herself introduced to slaughter her enemies. Scroll down for video... Queenpin: Griselda Blanco (pictured) has been shot dead outside a . butcher's shop in Colombia at the age of 69 in what many say is a . fitting end to her life of drug smuggling and murder . Ruthless: The Colombian was jailed for 20 years for three murders in the U.S. including that of a two-year-old . Although she was suspected of murdering many more, the Colombian was eventually convicted of three killings in 1985, including that of a two-year-old boy, for which she served nearly 20 years behind bars. In 2004, she was deported to her native country and maintained a low profile in her hometown of Medellin. According . to Colombian press reports, she was walking out of a butcher's shop . yesterday when two gunmen on motorbikes pulled up before one pumped two . bullets into her head. For a . woman who had been credited with inventing the notion of a 'motorcycle . assassin', the manner of her death came as no surprise to many, it was . reported in The Miami Herald.

Andreu, a former Miami homicide detective who had investigated her, . said: 'It’s surprising to all of us that she had not been killed sooner . because she made a lot of enemies. 'When . you kill so many and hurt so many people like she did, it’s only a . matter of time before they find you and try to even the score.' Former murder detective Nelson . Andreu . Brought . up in the slums of Medellin, Blanco went from a simple pickpocket to . command an empire that shipped an estimated 3,400lbs of cocaine a month. She also symbolised the . blood-soaked era of the 1970s and 80s when gangs would ambush their . rivals in public, leading to her cartel being dubbed the 'Cocaine . Cowboys'. She ran the empire with three of her . sons, two of whom were later assassinated in Colombia, while three of . her husbands have also been killed in drug-related violence. Cocaine capital: The drug trade that pervaded Miami under Blanco and her rivals inspired the Hollywood film Scarface, starring Al Pacino as Tony Montana (above) Flamboyant lifestyle: Blanco was so captivated by her gangland image she even named one of her sons Michael Corleone after the character played by Al Pacino (above) in The Godfather movies . Known for her flamboyant lifestyle, she named one of her sons Michael Corleone in tribute to The Godfather movies. Blanco's . exploits were also popularised in the 2006 documentary Cocaine Cowboys, . which explored the rise of the drug in Miami during the 1970s and 80s . which inspired the films Scarface and Miami Vice. Interviewees argue that Blanco played a major role in the history of the drug trade in the city and other areas across America. Detectives believe she was behind at least 40 murders and maybe even as many as 240, but could only link her to three. Built on crime: Much of the economic development in Miami (above) during the 70s and 80s was credited to the inexorable rise of the cocaine trade . Two of them, drug dealers Alfredo and . Grizel Lorenzo, were shot at their South Miami house after failing to . pay $250,000 for 5kg of cocaine. Blanco was also convicted of ordering a shooting that led to the death of two-year-old Johnny Castro, who was shot twice in the head as he drove in the car with his father, Jesus 'Chucho' Castro. She was fully expected to end up on Florida's Death Row. But she was able to cut a plea deal after the prosecution's case suffered a major setback when a chief witness was caught engaging in phone sex with secretaries from the attorney's office. Blanco later entered into a bargain with new prosecutors and was given three 20-year sentences in 1985. She only served a third of that time. Prior to the mid-1970s, marijuana had been the main import into Miami and the surrounding areas. But over the following years this was replaced by more lucrative cocaine. Crime lords used many different tactics to smuggle drugs into the country, but the main routes were by boat or air. The distribution networks were highly elaborate and technology such as electronic homing devices were employed to keep track of shipments. Condominiums were bought near the ocean to act as reconnaissance stations to look out for coast guards and cartels monitored the radio frequencies of Federal, State and local authorities. Legitimate businesses were then bought to shield these operations from the outside world. The 2006 documentary Cocaine Cowboys, right, reveals that much of the economic growth in Miami came from the drug trade as the cash that flowed into these businesses went on to indirectly finance the construction of many high-rise buildings in southern Florida. When law enforcement finally got on top of the corruption, many companies folded because of falling sales.","Griselda Blanco, 69, was jailed for 20 years in 1985 for three murders.

Chris LaPak, a 53-year-old married father of two and fitness buff, has now returned to work as CEO of a graphics company on Long Island, New York - even though paramedics who pulled him from the water in August were not sure he would make it. Speaking to ABC News six months on, he said it is a 'miracle' he is still alive. 'I'm on borrowed time,' he said. 'My heart stopped, and it remained stopped anywhere between 11 and 13 minutes.' Scroll down for video . Getting ready: Chris LaPak, pictured before taking part in the New York triathlon last August, suffered a heart attack in the water and was clinically dead for 11 minutes. He woke up without brain damage days later . Event: He was swimming in the Hudson River, pictured, on August 3 when he suffered cardiac arrest and started drowning in the water. He was spotted by a lifeguard who took him to a boat . LaPak's parents both died of heart attacks in their 50s  - but by the time he was 52, he had already completed three marathons and had signed up for the triathlon in New York City last August. 'I work out so much,' he said. 'I think subconsciously I thought could beat this whole thing.' Days before the triathlon, he had been at a hot yoga class when he felt chest pain and shortness of breath, but he ignored it. Doctors believe he actually suffered a heart attack, leaving him with an irregular heartbeat, ABC reported. Then on August 3, he planned to swim 1.5 kilometers, cycle for 40 kilometers and run for 10 kilometers in the trialthon, but his heart stopped shortly after he got into the Hudson River at 7am. The next thing he can remember, he was waking up in hospital five days later - but medical personnel have since revealed how their flawless response saved his life. After his heart stopped, he had started to drown and was immediately spotted by lifeguards and fished out of the water onto a surfboard. They then took him to a jet ski and a fire department boat. Fitness buff: Ahead of the triathlon, the 53-year-old had completed three marathons, including the Chicago Marathon with his daughter Christine, pictured. He is now back to running 10 miles a few times a week . NYC Triathlon Lifeguard Director Cary Epstein told Fox News that LaPak had no pulse and was 'as purple as you could ever possibly imagine'. 'I honestly didn't think that he was going to make it in the condition that he was in,' he said. LaPak was rushed to the dock, put in an ambulance and taken to Roosevelt Hospital before he was transferred to Mount Sinai St. Luke's Hospital. By the time he reached the hospital, he had been clinically dead for 11 minutes, paramedics said. Dr. Eyal Herzog, the director of Mount Sinai St. Luke's Cardiac Care Unit, cooled down LaPak's body to 94.1 degrees F (33 C) to protect his brain before slowly warming up his body again. When he opened his eyes five days later, he was able to tell the time and name everyone in the room. 'Everyone was in shock,' LaPak said. 'My family and friends had been told there was a less than 10 per cent chance I was going to live. And if I did, there was a 95 per cent chance I'd be brain dead.' Dr Herzog said that flawless work from every emergency responder made LaPak's survival possible. Quick-thinking: Dr. Eyal Herzog, the director of Mount Sinai St. Luke's Cardiac Care Unit, cooled down LaPak's body, saving him from brain damage. Dr Herzog said everyone in the field had responded perfectly . Healthy: LaPak, pictured with his wife Renee, is now back at work and has learned to slow down, he said . 'The people in the field were so good, they conducted it like a textbook chain of survival,' the doctor told the Daily Herald last year. 'From the soldier in the field to the expert captain in the hospital.' LaPak underwent double bypass surgery and had a defibrillator implanted. He now runs 10 to 12 miles several times a week and has also learned CPR in case he ever sees anyone in need. In November, he returned to Mount Sinai to meet with those who had saved him, and he became emotional at how thankful he was for their quick-thinking. 'They never quit on me,' he said.

17474,"Evaluation of the School Streets scheme also showed lower vehicle speeds on surrounding roads and a reduction in the number of cars around schools.
A report to the city council's transport and environment committee recommended making the pilot permanent.
The Living Streets Scotland charity wants it rolled out nationwide.
The 18-month scheme began in Edinburgh in September 2015.
The nine primary schools in the scheme are: Abbeyhill, Colinton, Cramond, Duddingston, Sciennes, St John's, Clermiston, St Peter's, and Towerbank.
Living Streets Scotland said other councils should also look at implementing the scheme.
It is not calling for a complete ban on cars around all schools as it said each should be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Stuart Hay, Living Streets Scotland director, said: ""We are calling on all local authorities to look at this scheme.
""All local authorities have similar problems.
""The main problems identified in Edinburgh were dangerous parking and manoeuvring by parents.""
Lesley Hinds, City of Edinburgh City Council's transport convener, said: ""The whole aim of School Streets was to create a safer, more relaxed atmosphere around schools, encouraging children to walk and cycle and parents to leave their cars at home.
""Therefore I'm delighted to see fewer cars around participating schools, slower speeds in nearby streets and more children walking in every day, contributing to a more welcoming environment for all.

'The panel acknowledged that you made an early admission in this respect. 'However it noted that you have not demonstrated a full understanding of the implications of your actions upon the reputation of the profession.

44168,"Warning: Professor Carrie Paechter, of the department of educational studies at Goldsmiths, University of London . Private school girls who are under intense parental pressure to excel are being driven to eating disorders, an academic has warned. They are being treated as ‘projects’ by middle-class parents who push them too hard to achieve in music and sport as well as exams, it was claimed. But the stress of striving to be ‘perfect at everything’ can lead to anorexia, bulimia and binge-drinking, according to Professor Carrie Paechter, of Goldsmiths College, London. She warned that the pressure to succeed is particularly intense at private schools, where pupils feel they must conform to the stereotype of the straight-A pupil. Professor Paechter will next week tell the heads of top private schools’ girls they should start telling some girls they are ‘doing too much’. Girls also need a ‘hard dose of reality’ about the sexist world they face when they leave school, she will tell the annual conference of Girls’ Schools Association. Speaking ahead of the event, the academic, a professor of education, warned that girls face further pressure to fit in with their classmates and avoid being excluded by cliques. Girls who are sociable and successful may find friendships more difficult since those who are popular may not actually be well-liked, she said. Stress is also caused by leading ‘overscheduled’ lives in pursuit of perfection and a desire to ‘live up to expectations’. ‘Girls are under pressure as never before’, Professor Paechter told the Times Educational Supplement. ‘There are girls in private schools who are “projects” of their parents, learning two or three instruments to grade eight standard and excelling in sport and academia because they feel that is what is expected of them, and that is what they expect of themselves.’ Concern: Carrie Paechter, of Goldsmiths College, is worried there is too much pressure on school girls (file picture) ‘But a few of them end up in anorexia clinics complaining that their schools only cared about their results. ‘Good schools need to start saying: “You can’t do that many A levels, even if you want to.”’ ‘The schools need to start looking at girls, saying: “This is too much, you do too many things.”’ She added: ‘In middle-class families it’s not just about doing well at school, they have to be fabulous all-rounders. ‘Schools give them that message to an extent that to stand out from the crowd they must be a fantastic human being as well as doing really well at GCSEs and A levels.’ The professor also said it was important for schools to avoid turning young women who expected to have four children, a fulfilling career and a full social life. ‘If you’re being picked on that’s awful, but if you’re just ordinary you can have a decent time at school, keeping out of it’ ‘You want to keep them aspirational, but you want them to be confident enough to say, “I don’t want this”, if it is too much,’ she said. Girls also need to be warned about the ‘very serious glass ceiling they could confront,’ she added. In a separate interview, she described research into friendship groups among girls. ‘These friendship groups frequently have low tolerance for difference between group members and keep each other under constant scrutiny, excluding those who don’t make the grade,’ she said. ‘We need to be aware that it is frequently those girls who appear to be the most socially successful for whom this is a problem, and to act rapidly when problems come to our attention. These are likely to be the tip of a much larger iceberg.’ Concern: The impact of a demanding school life could drive some school girls to anorexia, it has been warned (file picture) She added: ‘There is a lot of pressure to be top of the social group, but often girls who are popular aren’t well liked - they’re feared because they’re dominant. ‘One group we studied at a school was very dominant and they kept constant surveillance on each other, checking they had their socks rolled down in the exact way and that their hair was done properly. ‘This was a very affluent school. They all had long blonde hair and highlights and all wore designer clothes outside school. There was pressure to be beautiful all the time or you were letting the group down. ‘One of the girls was whispered about because her ponytail wasn’t how it should be, and it took her all day to realise what was wrong, then she was mortified. 'The “terms” of the group can change overnight without a member realising. Girls further down the pecking order don’t notice how their socks should be. ‘If you’re being picked on that’s awful, but if you’re just ordinary you can have a decent time at school, keeping out of it.’ On its MyDaughter website, offers advice and support to parents of girls, the Girls’ Schools Association points out the ‘danger of expecting “the best” from each girl’. ‘The fall from dizzy heights of success can be a painful experience and undoubtedly it can be lonely at the top,’ it says.‘Our job is to ensure that the girls are ready and armed to cope with such challenges and the inevitable ups and downs.’","Professor Carrie Paechter, of Goldsmiths College, warns of anorexia.

A mother is determined that no one else will have to endure the pain of their child dying from consuming too many energy drinks. Shani Clarke's son, Michael, used to drink at least four 500ml cans of Mother a day - as well as four to five cups of coffee before he was found slumped behind the wheel of the 11 tonne truck on the side of the road in Perth on January 30 this year.

The Facebook campaign has taken of with almost 500 members joining the cause . It wasn't until last month when the coroner told her how her son had died that she decided to educate others on the possible perils of consuming too many energy drinks through the Facebook page - Caffeine Toxicity Death Awareness. • Energy drinks are not made available in     primary nor secondary schools . • Marketing and advertising activities of energy drinks are not directed at children . • No promotional activities are undertaken that encourage excessive consumption of energy drinks . • Labels of energy drinks do not promote the mixing of energy drinks with any other beverage. 'I was so angry when I found out it was caffeine as I had lost my first born and it could have been avoided if he hadn't drank so many of these drinks without a break,' she said in the post. 'His body couldn't process the caffeine anymore and it built up in his body and it caused a massive heart attack.' Ms Clarke has received an overwhelming response since starting the page with many admitting they didn't realise the possible dangers and some have even given up the drinks. One lady admitted to being addicted to cans of V for almost a decade. 'Today starts my sugar free September. And good bye v forever! I'm doing it cause I was unaware of this. It's hit to close to home. Not taking any chances.' While another posted that she was unaware of the dangers of energy drinks. 'I drink coffee in the morning and two energy drinks a day.

The avoidable death has also prompted experts to speak about the dangers of the energy drink. Chair of general practitioners for the Australian Medical Association, Dr Brian Morton warned that people should not consume more than the equivalent of a total of two cups of coffee per day. 'The body is just not made to take that sheer capacity of toxic levels of chemicals' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'The quantity that you have and the amount of caffeine you drink as a consequence will absorb into your body which can be quite significant such as a toxic effect,' he said. 'It can unmask electrical abnormalities in the heart for example that you are born with - it is a short circuit in the electrical wiring that can cause sudden death.' While WA Health's deputy chief health officer Andy Robertson told the ABC it was recommended not to consume more than 400 milligrams of caffeine a day - a  500ml can of a typical energy drink carries about 160mg. Meanwhile, Australian Beverages Council CEO Geoff Parker said the Australian energy drinks market is one of the most regulated in the world. 'Products across the category are clearly labelled with a 500ml daily usage maximum,' he said . 'Australia’s strict regulations, in addition to a cap on the caffeine content, equivalent to an instant cup of coffee for a 250mL can (80mg), make our energy drink regulations the tightest in the world,'","Michael Clarke, 35, died from consuming too many energy drinks.

27534,"The ""nuclear option"" would be the changing of Senate rules to enable judicial and executive nominees to be confirmed with just 51 votes instead of 60. Apparently you need 60 votes to do just about anything in the Senate but change the rules. That only takes 51 votes. Nuclear? That sounds harsh for something as simple as a rule change. Senators view themselves as being part of the ""world's greatest deliberative body."" It's a debatable point, but in order to protect the minority party and make sure nobody does anything without a full debate, Senate rules require that 60 of 100 senators agree to votes to move toward confirming a nominee or passing legislation. In the fancy language they speak on Capitol Hill, moving toward a vote is called ""invoking cloture."" Senate moving toward 'going nuclear' Actually confirming the nominee or passing the legislation takes only 50 votes, but because of the procedural rules, it pretty much takes 60 to invoke cloture and get anything done these days. By requiring only 51 votes, the entire character of the chamber would change. Instead of being forced to get buy-in from the minority party (Republicans right now), the majority party (Democrats right now) would be able to confirm anybody for whom they could get a simple majority. Click here for a good academic paper from George Kroger at the University of Miami on ""The Rise of the 60-Vote Senate"" The idea is that it would ""blow up"" the Senate. We're speaking figuratively, of course. The symbolism of ""going nuclear"" also portends a sort of mutually assured destruction in the future, to borrow another Cold War term. Democrats won't always control the Senate. And when Republicans are in charge, you can bet they'll return the favor. Man who coined the term 'nuclear option' regrets ever pursuing it . Wow. That does sound serious. Is this constitutional? Sure is. The Constitution doesn't say anything about Senate rules. It puts that power in the hands of senators and congressmen. ""Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings,"" according to Article 1, Section 5. Senators are tasked with signing off on nominees in Article II, Section 2. But it doesn't say how exactly, which has led to a centuries-long debate on the matter. Here's what the Constitution says about the president's power to appoint: ""He shall have Power... with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments."" OK. Fine. There's nothing in the Constitution. But Senate rules are pretty clear on the 60-vote threshold. Yes, they are. Read the chapter on cloture. But they've changed over time. Until 1949, for instance, according to the Congressional Research Service, senators couldn't even move to limit debate (invoke cloture) on nominations. According to the Senate website, Henry Clay was the first senator to threaten going nuclear, back in 1841, on legislation. Up until 1975, it actually took 67 votes to overcome a filibuster. The most famous examples came during the Civil Rights era when Southerners from both parties blocked equal rights legislation. It took 60 days of filibustering to find the votes for the 1964 Civil Rights Act. What role does filibustering play in all this? Everybody seems to have a different definition of what a filibuster is. In pop culture, filibustering brings to mind Jimmy Stewart in ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" speaking for hours to block legislation with which he disagrees. Anymore the filibuster is an implied thing. When everybody realizes that if there aren't 60 votes to limit debate, senators don't generally spend much time debating at all. They just move on. Even when a senator mounts a long, all-night speech, the outcome is usually pre-ordained. Take Sen. Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who spoke all night just before the recent government shutdown. Even before Cruz started speaking, senators had reached agreement to vote on a government funding bill the next day. His speech was not a filibuster; it was preaching to his political choir. Why is all this coming to a head now? This is where it gets even more complicated. Republicans have been blocking nominees to the D.C. Court of Appeals not because they dislike all the nominees, but because they don't want more Democrats than Republicans on that court. Currently, there are equal numbers of Democratic and Republican appointed judges on the court, which is considered second only to the Supreme Court in importance. In fact, Republicans want to shrink the number of judges on the court and expand the number of judges in other courts. But this is a fight that extends way beyond the current spat over the D.C Circuit Court. The number of filibusters has exploded in recent years, and so has the number of votes trying to end them. Between 1949 and 2012, cloture was invoked 122 times. The vast majority of those occurred in the past decade. Democrats, who employed the tactic of filibustering to some effect during the George W. Bush administration, now say they're fed up with Republicans employing it against President Barack Obama. Read a really detailed look at the history of filibusters and cloture filings from the Congressional Research Service. Republicans block nominees to D.C. court .","Senate rules require 60 votes to move toward confirming a nominee or passing legislation.

Lloyd, 27, had been shot five times at close range. Also on Wednesday, prosecution witness Vanessa Sanchez took the stand. She told jurors that she and her boyfriend had met the football player and his fiancée, Shayanna, along with another couple at the South Street Cafe in Providence, Rhode Island on June 16 at 11pm - around four hours before Odin Lloyd was killed. Hernandez and Shayanna left around midnight, Miss Sanchez said. Providence is about a 30 minute drive from the couple's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts.

Canadian media said police had raided a property in Strathroy, about 225km (140 miles) south-west of Toronto.
They named the suspect as Aaron Driver, 24, who was arrested last year for openly supporting so-called Islamic State on social media.
A senior police official told the Canadian Press news agency that the suspect allegedly planned to use a bomb to carry out a suicide bombing mission in a public area.
An internal government memo seen by the CTV network says his alleged plan was to use a homemade bomb to create mass casualties.
The RCMP statement said it had received ""credible information of a potential terrorist threat"".
""A suspect was identified and the proper course of action has been taken to ensure that there is no danger to the public's safety,"" it added.
""As this is still an unfolding matter and the investigation is still under way, we are not able to provide further comment at this time.""
CBC News said Aaron Driver's family had confirmed his death.
It said that police had told the family that Driver had detonated an explosive device, injuring himself and another person.
Driver was intending to detonate a second device and that was why police shot him, the report said.
Driver, a Muslim convert, came to the authorities' attention in 2014 for tweeting in support of IS, using the alias Harun Abdourahman.
He was taken into custody and interrogated by police in July 2015 over concerns he would become involved in planning an attack.
He was not charged, but released on bail and had to wear a GPS ankle bracelet and undergo religious counselling, according to the CBC.
The electronic tag was removed in February when he agreed to the terms of a court order limiting his activities because there were reasonable grounds that he might aid a terror group or terrorist activity.
He was not allowed to have a computer or mobile phone until the end of August and was banned from social media sites and contacting IS or any other militant groups, the Winnipeg Free Press reports.

The BBC says the parking company was caught leaving holidaymakers' cars in random locations such as side streets and even town centres when they assumed they were being parked in a secure car park. A parking firm taking Gatwick Airport passengers' cars to 'secure parking' allegedly left them on side streets (File pic) One customer told the TV show that her car had an extra 1,500 miles on the clock when she returned . The internet site for Gold Parking describes the company as 'the most affordable and convenient Meet and Greet Parking Company at Gatwick Airport' and claims, 'All our compounds are 24/7 manned'. One customer told the TV show that her car had an extra 1,500 miles on the clock when she returned, while another reported that their Mercedes had been stolen. The show's presenter Matt Allwright and his team secretly checked to see whether the firm had a secure car park by providing three fake customers who handed over cars to Gold Parking. The customers were charged £90 for one week and £150 for two weeks to have their vehicle taken to the company's 'secure car park', but on each occasion the cars were left out in the open in Crawley, in communal public carparks, outside shops and in a residential side street. Exposed: Gold Parking, exposed by Watchdog on the BBC parked some cars in the Three Bridges Community Centre . Secure? Other cars were parked in a residential road in Crawley called Thatcher Close . Gatwick Airport has an approved list of parking firms and Gold Parking is not one of them . Crawley residents told the BBC they often saw unfamiliar vehicles left in the open for days on end. The BBC show, which aired last Wednesday, featured Dipesh Toor, who left his £45,000 Mercedes with Gold Parking and returned to find it had been stolen. The company told Watchdog it did have access to a secure compound which it shared with other companies. It claimed Mr Toor's Mercedes was stolen from within this car park. Brenda Jones left her Audi A7 with Gold Parking while on honeymoon in Cuba, and when she returned found the car was dirty, had a ripped tyre and an extra 1,500 miles on the clock. The couple subsequently received a parking fine in the post, stating the vehicle had been parked in a residents' parking space without a permit and two weeks later another fine arrived for a pay and display space. TravelMail was unable to contact Gold Parking on repeated occasions, and its website has been removed. Gatwick Airport has a list of approved 'meet and great operators' for off-airport parking who passengers are advised to use. Gold Parking is not one of them.","Parking firm Gold Parking exposed by Watchdog on the BBC. It allegedly left holidaymakers' cars in random locations such as side streets.

82021,"Holy Trinity Church in Rothwell, Northamptonshire - home to one of only two 13th Century crypts in the UK - contains the remains of 2,500 people.
Radio carbon dating found some skulls were older than first thought.
But scientists from the University of Sheffield, who ""assumed the ossuary was a medieval thing"", were also surprised to find bones from the last century.
""It seems people continued to put skulls and bones down here, not only into the post-medieval period but even as late as around 1900,"" Dr Lizzie Craig-Atkins said.

The Holy Trinity crypt is just one of two 13th Century sites in the UK, with the other being at St Leonard's in Hythe, Kent.
Testing on five skull samples was carried out by scientists at the University of Sheffield, using facilities based at the Queen's University in Belfast.
The process, which took weeks to complete, involved the bone samples being crushed, chemically separated and freeze dried before graphite was extracted.
Professor Paula Reimer, from the University of Belfast, said: ""We know what the rate of change of the amount of radio carbon is, so we measure what is still in the sample and from that we can calculate how long it has been since death.""
Dr Crangle said the bones, which legend said belonged to soldiers or plague victims, would actually have been the remains of local people placed in the crypt by their families.
""They were deliberately built so people could be prayed for. They were built to protect the dead, and were built to be visited,"" she said.
Researchers now plan to gather further samples to gather a fuller picture of when bodies found in the crypt were laid to rest.","Scientists have discovered the remains of a crypt built in the 13th Century, dating back more than 2,000 years."
36840,"The motion was defeated by 483 votes to 111, after all Tory, Lib Dem and Labour MPs had been instructed to oppose it.
In total 81 Tories are known to have defied the whips, while others abstained.
Labour leader Ed Miliband said the revolt was a ""humiliation"" for the prime minister.
""If he can't win the argument with his own backbenchers, how can the country have confidence that he can win the arguments that matter for Britain?"" he said.
A Downing Street spokesman said many people who voted for the motion felt very strongly, and their views were respected.
""However, the government has to do what is in the national interest. The easy thing to do would have been for us to have avoided expressing a view. It was important to take a strong lead - because Britain's best interests are served by being in the EU.""
The five-hour Commons debate on the issue was prompted after a petition was signed by more than 100,000 people.
The motion called for a referendum on whether the UK should stay in the EU, leave it or renegotiate its membership.
The government was expected to win easily - and even if it had lost, the result would not be binding on ministers.
This is by far the biggest rebellion Mr Cameron has suffered since entering Downing Street.
The previous largest Tory rebellion over Europe was in 1993, when 41 MPs defied John Major on the Maastricht Treaty.
Education Secretary Michael Gove insisted on Tuesday that the time was not right for a referendum to take place.
He told the BBC: ""The most important thing is to make sure we get powers back, so we take more decisions here about employment, about growth, about jobs. These are critical issues.
""At the moment David Cameron is battling in Europe in order to make sure that we can have those decisions taken here. It may be that in the future as a result of the battle David Cameron is fighting for Britain that a referendum may be needed, but my judgement is that we need to get those powers back.""
BBC political editor Nick Robinson says Mr Cameron will now face pressure to spell out what he means by promising ""fundamental change"" in the UK's relationship with Europe.
Conservative MP David Nuttall, who proposed the motion, argued there were more than 40 million people of voting age in the UK who had not been consulted on the question of Europe.
By Ross HawkinsPolitical correspondent, BBC News
The Conservative leadership thought it would be bad. And it was.
In fact, it was almost twice as bad as the worst rebellion David Cameron has suffered so far.
The prime minister has always cast himself as a Eurosceptic.
Many in his party have decided he is not nearly Eurosceptic enough.
Some Tories think a referendum on EU membership is now a certainty.
That is far from settled. After all, the Eurosceptics lost this vote.
But they think they have won a place for an in-out referendum in the mainstream of Conservative thought.
Commentators: Is this the end of Britain's EU debate?
And he said the UK Parliament was becoming ""ever more impotent"" as the ""tentacles"" of the European Union ""intruded into more and more areas of national life"".
In a statement to the Commons, Mr Cameron said he shared the rebels' ""yearning for fundamental reform"", and promised ""the time for reform was coming"".
He insisted he remained ""firmly committed"" to ""bringing back more powers"" from Brussels, but on demands for a referendum, he said amid an economic crisis the timing was wrong and Britain's national interest was to be part of the EU.
""When your neighbour's house is on fire, your first impulse should be to help them to put out the flames - not least to stop the flames reaching your own house,"" he said.
Labour leader Ed Miliband, who saw 19 Eurosceptic MPs within his own party rebel, likened the Tories' divisions of Europe to a rerun of an old movie.
He called the Tories an ""out-of-touch party tearing itself apart over Europe"".
However, he did agree with the prime minister that it was the wrong time for a referendum.
""The best answer to the concerns of the British people about the concerns of the European Union is to reform the way it works, not to leave it,"" he added.
Tory backbenchers voiced their dismay at the three-line whip - the strongest order a party can give - on Conservative MPs, which meant any who voted against the government would be expected to resign from government jobs.
Conservative MP Stewart Jackson told the Commons he would vote for the motion ""with a heavy heart"" and ""take the consequences"", which may mean losing his position as parliamentary private secretary to Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson.
He said he wished there could have been a well-informed reasonable debate, instead of ""heavy-handed whipping"" and ""catastrophic management"" by his party.
Fellow Tory MP Adam Holloway, a parliamentary private secretary to Europe minister David Lidington, rebelled and voted for the motion but said he still believed the prime minister was doing a good job.
Anger was also directed towards Foreign Secretary William Hague, who earlier tried to quell the rebellion by calling the motion ""a piece of graffiti"".
Later in the Commons, he said a referendum would ""add to economic uncertainty at a dangerous and difficult time"" and suggested most British people did not want to ""say yes or no to everything in the EU"".
Tory MPs accused him of going native and abandoning his Eurosceptic views.
The Lib Dems came under attack too, accused of being ""charlatans"" by Conservative MP Philip Davies for abandoning a manifesto pledge for an in-out referendum on the EU.
But Lib Dem Martin Horwood insisted the party committed to an in-out referendum at the time of a fundamental shift (in Britain's relationship with the EU).
Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has said it is the worst time for a debate about Britain leaving the EU as a ""firestorm"" engulfs the eurozone.
One Liberal Democrat MP, Adrian Sanders, defied his party's leadership and voted for a referendum.
The UK Independence Party, which campaigns for the UK to quit the EU, said the Conservatives were ""tearing themselves apart"" over Europe. Its leader Nigel Farage had urged MPs from all parties ""to vote with their conscience, ahead of their party or career"".
In the coalition agreement, the Conservatives and the Lib Dems, a traditionally pro-European party, agreed to ""ensure that the British government is a positive participant in the European Union, playing a strong and positive role with our partners"".",The Conservatives have defeated a motion calling for an in-out referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union.

In the south-east another port city, Mukalla, fell to al-Qaeda militants, who seized a military base.
Meanwhile, two Saudi soldiers have been killed guarding the border with Yemen.
Over the past two weeks, fighting in Yemen has left more than 500 people dead and some 1,700 wounded, UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos has said.
The UN Security Council is due to meet on Saturday to discuss a Russian proposal for a pause in the Saudi-led campaign.
President Hadi fled to Saudi Arabia on 25 March after rebel forces advanced on Aden.
He faces opposition from troops loyal to the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh ousted in the Arab Spring protests, the Houthis and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula which opposes both the Houthis and President Hadi.
This week, the Shia Houthi rebels pushed through to the heart of Aden using tanks and armoured vehicles.
But on Friday they were forced from the Crater neighbourhood and the presidential palace they had overrun the day before.
Saudi-backed fighters loyal to Mr Hadi also received an airdrop of arms supplies from coalition planes.
Meanwhile, a military base and the port of the south-eastern port city of Mukalla were taken over by al-Qaeda militants.  It happened a day after fighters broke into the town's jail freeing prisoners.
A military official said al-Qaeda ""took the headquarters of the 2nd Military Region in the afternoon without resistance"".
Mukalla is the provincial capital of the country's largest province, Hadramawt, which has a long stretch of border with Saudi Arabia.
Hadramawt's governor, Adel Ba-hamed, said Mukalla's fall was part of a ""scenario aimed at dragging the province and its residents'' into the chaos across Yemen.
The death of two Saudi border guards followed the announcement of the first Saudi casualty - a soldier shot from the Yemeni side of the border in the same area, the Asir region - on Thursday.
Saudi Arabia has 150,000 troops and 100 warplanes assigned to assist Yemen, according to a Saudi adviser.
It began air strikes in Yemen on 25 March.
The Saudi government says the aim of its operation is to protect President Hadi's ""legitimate government"". It says it has no plans to deploy ground forces for now.
Supporters of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh staged a demonstration against the air strikes in the capital, Sanaa, on Friday.

55966,"He named five people:
Fifteen years later, these men still form President Putin's core group and dominate the strategic heights of Russian government and big business:
This core group illustrates two important points about who runs Russia.
First, there has been continuity in terms of the personnel closest to Mr Putin. Real reshuffles are rare, and very few have been evicted from this core group.
Second, the heart of the leadership team is made up of allies who served with Mr Putin in the KGB, in 1990s St Petersburg, or both.
This core group also includes others whom the president trusts to implement major infrastructure projects, such as Arkady Rotenberg, one of those responsible for the Sochi Winter Olympics, as well as several regional figures and senior bureaucrats.
Many of these figures held senior positions even before Mr Putin's rise to power.
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, formerly Minister of Emergency Situations, was a prominent party political figure in the second half of the 1990s and leader of the United Russia party from 2001-05.
Such figures convene in the security council, one of the most important organisations for co-ordinating high-level decision-making and resources.
At the same time, the Russian administrative system - the so-called vertical of power - does not function well: policy instructions are often implemented tardily and sometimes not at all, so others have important roles helping develop and implement projects.
One such individual is Yuri Trutnev, elected as a regional governor in 2000, and then appointed Minister for Natural Resources and Ecology in 2004.
In 2013, he was promoted to Deputy Prime Minister and Presidential Plenipotentiary to the Russian Far Eastern Federal District, a high priority post for Mr Putin.
Russian observers also point to the role played by Vyacheslav Volodin in helping Mr Putin run Russian politics since 2011.
Mr Volodin rose through regional and then national party politics, before being appointed to government positions.
He established the influential All-Russian Popular Front in 2011, which makes an increasingly significant contribution to formulation, implementation and monitoring of the leadership's policies.
Mr Volodin was subsequently appointed First Deputy Head of the presidential administration, responsible for overseeing a ""reset"" of Russian domestic politics since 2012.
Alongside continuity in the core leadership team, there has been a growing need for effective managers to implement its policies.
Indeed, rather than shrinking, as some commentators have suggested, the leadership team appears to be expanding.
There are several rising stars who play increasingly important roles in party politics and administration.
One is 39-year-old Alexander Galushka, who is a member of the Popular Front and many of the president's and prime minister's advisory committees.
He was appointed Minister of the Far Eastern region in 2013.
This leads us to the final point about who runs Russia with Mr Putin - while the President is the central figure, he is part of a team, which itself is part of a system, and therefore highlights the importance of effectiveness in implementing tasks.
All the individuals have reputations for hard work, loyalty and proven effectiveness in completing difficult tasks in business, state administration and politics.
As one Russian close to Mr Putin has observed, he did not choose them for their pretty eyes, but because they get things done.
Andrew Monaghan is a senior research fellow in the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House.","As Vladimir Putin stepped down as president of Russia, he named a group of people - the president, the prime minister and the president himself."

'I have learnt a lot of lessons,' she said.  'The problem is Barnes if full of mothers with children who don't go out much at night. 'So although we were doing 200 lunches on a Saturday and breaking even, I need to give a proper return to shareholders.' Horlick is now planning to try again in nearby Chiswick, where - although it, too, is home to a large population of 'yummy mummies' - she believes she has found more suitable premises. She intends to be open in time for Valentine's Day and says she has six chefs and six front-of-house staff already lined up. She launched Georgina's after having the . idea for it while sitting on her sick daughter's bed discussing her . favourite foods while she was being treated at Great Ormond Street . Hospital in 1998. 'Superwoman' and her large family - this 1997 photo shows her with her nanny and children (L-R) Rupert, Alice, Antonia, Georgina and Serena.  After Georgina died she had another son, Benjie . When she launched it in spring 2012, Horlick said she intended to fill a hole in the market by offering good food at breakfast and lunchtimes, as well as dinner in the evenings. She told bighospitality.co.uk: 'There will be amazing homemade granolas and yogurts in the morning and then fantastic salads at lunchtime but a full service dinner in the evening. 'A lot of restaurants in London do very, very little trade at lunchtime and don't do any breakfast or teatime trade and that is actually rather a waste when costs are so incredibly high.' She added: 'I wouldn't do it unless I thought it was a good business proposition because there is no point otherwise.' 'Full of mothers': Barnes, with its pond and coffee shops, is a popular place for families in south west London . Georgina's was well-received by diners in Barnes, who wrote enthusiastic reviews on the TopTable website. 'Went . here for dinner and the food was amazing!', wrote one.  'Really liked . the decor too, simplistic but stylish -  would definitely return and try . the brunch that I've heard is yummy.' Another wrote: 'A really good spot for a light, healthy lunch.  Highly recommended.' Born in December 1960 to Michael Gayford and his Polish wife, Suzanna, Nicola was educated at Cheltenham Ladies' College and Birkenhead High School before studying law at Oxford. In 1983 she joined SG Warburg as a graduate trainee, and rose to director level before joining Morgan Grenfell Asset Management nine years later. Meanwhile, she had married financier Tim Horlick in 1984, an old friend from Oxford, and had her first child, Georgina, in 1986. Horlick brought the Midas touch to Morgan Grenfell, turning the company upside-down, dramatically increasing its profits, and earning herself £1.5million a year - a vast sum 16 years ago - for her work. Role model: In the mid-1990s, Nicola Horlick appeared to be the working City mother who had it all . When Morgan Grenfell sacked Horlick, she flew to their Frankfurt HQ - with 40 journalists in tow - to ask why . But it was in 1997 that she earned herself the 'Superwoman' tag when, after being sacked from Morgan Grenfell, she summoned a pack of 40 journalists and flew with them to the company's Frankfurt offices to demand her job back. At 36, she already had five children, one of whom was seriously ill, to cope with alongside her high-powered job, but the country was entranced by the supermother who wouldn't take no for an answer. Ultimately, though, she did, and went off alone, setting up SG Asset Management in 1997, the year before her daughter died of leukaemia, and then Bramdean Asset Management in 2005. In 2005 Horlick got divorced and met journalist Martin Baker, when he came to interview her for the Sunday Telegraph.  She and Baker married the following year, and they live together in Barnes. After her first marriage ended in divorce, Horlick found love with newspaper journalist Martin Baker . Horlick's independent career appeared to be coasting when, in 2008, she lost £12million of investors' money to fraudster Bernie Madoff and his Ponzi scam. Since then, she has launched the Rockpool investment company, gone into film production with Derby Street films, and joined the board of an NHS trust. Two months ago she announced plans to launch a crowdfunding venture, a website called Money&Co, in early 2014. Horlick . said the site would allow investors to make loans available to . fledgling businesses, which would be repaid with a profit if the venture . were a success.","Nicola Horlick, 53, opened Georgina's bistro in Barnes, south west London.

Testifying at his commutation hearing, Gardner said he accepts responsibility for killing two men and seriously wounding a third.

2854,"I usually patiently explain that if I knew what was in the chancellor's red box, I probably wouldn't have to work for a living. But there are a few areas where we have a good idea of what Philip Hammond is planning.
Some Budget changes have already been announced.  It's always helpful to remember this when MPs start cheering re-announced tax cuts or fuel duty freezes.
In the new financial year that begins on April 6, the amount you can earn before paying income tax will rise from £10,600 to £11,500. The higher rate threshold will rise from £43,000 to £45,000.
For savers, the annual ISA limit rises from £15,240 to £20,000. Corporation tax will be cut from 20% to 19%. Insurance premium tax will rise from 10% to 12% in June. Petrol duty is frozen until April 2018.
The Treasury has already trailed several announcements that will mean higher spending on technical education and (some) schools in England. The Welsh Government will get a share of increases in comparable spending in England, to spend as it chooses. If the chancellor announces extra cash for social care in England, the same rule applies.
Business rates are more complicated. They are devolved, but if Mr Hammond finds some more money for England via the Department for Communities and Local Government, then expect a cheque to head west to Cardiff Bay too.
Philip Hammond may be known ironically as 'Box Office Phil' in some quarters but he may have unwittingly raised expectations about the proposed Swansea Bay Region City Deal when he jaunitly told MPs last week: ""This discussion is still ongoing. I hope we may bring it to conclusion within, let's say. the next 8 days.""
Since then UK government sources have suggested that more work needs to be done before the city deal is formally signed off, although there may be more ""warm words"" in the Budget speech.
Supporters of the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon project who expect the chancellor to give the go-ahead tomorrow are likely to be disappointed. Although a report it commissioned was effusive about its potential, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy does not appear to have given its approval.
One of the city's MPs, Carolyn Harris, is more optimistic that Mr Hammond will respond positively to her campaign to stop councils charging for children's funerals.
Finance Secretary, Mark Drakeford, may be less certain that the Welsh Government's Budget shopping list - more money for health and social care, no more cuts and an end to austerity - will meet with a warm reception from the chancellor. With Mr Hammond warning about eye-wateringly high levels of debt and against spending sprees, any cash boost is unlikely to be more than modest.
The new chancellor approaches the Budget rather differently from his predecessor, George Osborne, who often gave the impression Budget day was a news deadline.  Mr Hammond appears content to wait for a policy to be worked through rather than to announce it to an artificial deadline.
Stephen Crabb, who served alongside both men in David Cameron's cabinet told me: ""Philip Hammond takes a much more accountant-like approach. He's interested in cold, hard facts - cold, hard numbers. And this is where the challenge is for Welsh politicians in terms of securing more investment into Wales - is to make winning economic arguments.
""With George Osborne it was much more about the politics, particularly in the run-up to the 2015 general election. We're now in a phase where actual cold, hard economic arguments will sway the Treasury, probably little else.""
If you have six minutes to spare, I've put together a few things to look out for in this Sunday Politics film.","If you've ever wondered what the Welsh Government is planning for the next financial year, you've probably heard me say ""Box Office Phil""."

69361,"The United States aims to use new sanctions imposed on North Korea over the cyber attack on Sony Pictures to cut off the country's remaining links to the international financial system, a senior U.S. Treasury official said on Tuesday. Daniel Glaser, assistant secretary for terrorist financing at the U.S. Treasury Department, said past sanctions had already discouraged 'hundreds' of overseas banks, including China's major commercial banks, from doing business with North Korea. New sanctions announced by President Barack Obama on January 2 provided 'a tremendous amount of flexibility' and the goal was to identify remaining financial institutions that allowed North Korea access to the global system, which could face sanction themselves, Glaser told a House of Representatives briefing. Daniel Glaser, (left) assistant secretary for terrorist financing at the U.S. Treasury Department, said past sanctions had already discouraged 'hundreds' of overseas banks from doing business with North Korea. He said sanctions announced by President Obama (right) have provided 'a tremendous amount of flexibility' 'We could target any North Korean government agency; we could target any North Korean government official ... we could apply sanctions with respect to any individual or entity who is providing them, in turn, material support,' he said. Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called for use of the full scope of the new sanctions announced after U.S. authorities said North Korea was behind the Sony attack. 'The significance of this new Executive Order may come from the broad power it gives the president to target anyone who is a part of the North Korean government, or is assisting them in any way … that is if the administration chooses to use it to its full advantage,' he told the briefing. 'We need to step up and target those financial institutions in Asia and beyond that are supporting the brutal and dangerous North Korean regime.' When challenged by Royce about 'a number of small banks' still doing business with North Korea and the need to choke off the country's access to hard currency, Glaser replied: 'That's exactly what we are trying to do.' The Interview stars James Franco and Seth Rogen (pictured). Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called for use of the full scope of the new sanctions announced after U.S. authorities said North Korea was behind the Sony attack . Royce said he hoped a bipartisan bill he sponsored that would label North Korea 'a primary money laundering concern' would be passed by the Senate this year. At a news conference at the United Nations in New York, North Korea's Deputy U.N. Ambassador An Myong Hun reiterated his country's position that it had nothing to do with the Sony hacking and said the United States should provide evidence. Long-standing international sanctions have sought to push North Korea to end its nuclear weapons program, but while they have slowed the program, they have not stopped it. The country's main economic ties are with China and, according U.S. government reports, its tiny economy has supported itself with money-making scams ranging from counterfeiting $100 bills to illicit arms and drug sales.

After 90 tons of manure and two years of round-the-clock care, Britain's most expensive pineapple is almost ready to eat. Ripening in the greenhouse at the Lost Gardens of Heligan in Cornwall, the record-breaking fruit was grown using Victorian cultivation methods and is worth an estimated £10,000. But if the Heligan pineapple sounds pricey, then spare a thought for the Japanese buyer who splashed out 1.6 million yen (£10,300) for just two melons. Expensive: Canteloupe, or Yubari, melons like the ones sold last week are a status symbol in Japan . The record-breaking Yubari, or canteloupe, melons were sold during an auction at Sapporo Central Wholesale Market in northern Hokkaido last Friday. The eye-watering price is the third highest ever paid for the fruit, with the most expensive pair selling for 2.5 million yen (£16,300) in 2008. Although few command the price of a Yubari melon, Japan is one of the most expensive places in the world for fruit and vegetables. A single apple typically retails for around £3.30 while the average price of a presentation pack of 20 cherries is a whopping £65.50. Pricey: The Lost Gardens of Heligan's pineapple (left) and the world's most expensive fungi, truffles (right) Three: The number of trips to Falmouth needed to collect 90 tonnes of manure . Four: Number of people required to tend the pineapples and replace the old manure . One: The number of painters needed to keep the glasshouse in pineapple-worthy condition . But despite the high prices commanded by canteloupe melons, a status symbol in the Far East, there are some fruit and vegetables that cost even more. Truffles regularly fetch more than £196,000 per pound at auction, while saffron sells for an average of £3,200. A single pound of saffron contains more than 225,000 stigmas from 75,000 crocus plants, while truffles are both rare and difficult to dig up. Other painfully expensive varieties of fruit and vegetable include Ruby Roman grapes, which can sell for as much as £4,100 per pound at auction, which works out as roughly £170 per grape. Similarly expensive are La Bonnotte potatoes, which are grown exclusively on the island of Noirmoutier, just off the French Atlantic coast. Only 100 tonnes of La Bonnotte potatoes are grown each year, and they sell for a wallet-busting £210 for a single pound.","The record-breaking fruit was grown in the Lost Gardens of Heligan in Cornwall.

With its classic shape and yellow-and-green pattern, it would not look out of place filled with flowers in a quiet home. And that is exactly where a priceless porcelain vase remained for decades - until it sold for nearly £3 million. The mystery owner of the 16-inch Chinese artefact had no idea of its staggering value when she inherited it from a family member. Instead she put flowers in it and placed it on a chest of drawers. Priceless: The 300-year-old vase is 16 inches high and depicts eight bats flying around clouds and flowers . Its true worth was only revealed when valuers from auction house Christie's visited the home to examine other Chinese ceramics. The family member who left the vase behind had bought it in New York from a well-known dealer in Chinese art, but it is thought its true value was underestimated. Pedram Rasti, an expert in Chinese art . at the auction house, said: The previous owners had inherited it and didn't really know a great deal about the vase other than that it was Chinese. 'They didn't quite understand the potential value of what they had. 'In . fact, when we arrived at their house to have a look at it and a few . other items it was sat on top of a cupboard with flowers in it. 'When my colleague saw the vase and realised what it was he was taken aback.' For decades the £3m vase was filled with flowers on top of a chest of drawers, its huge value unknown . The vase carries the mark of the Yongzheng emperor, who reigned from 1722 to 1735 at a landmark time for Chinese art. For the first time designers could use enamel made in China rather than importing it from Europe. That freed them to leave behind traditional blue and white porcelain and adorn their vases with bright colours. Ceramics were reserved for the richest homes and depicted natural scenes and floral patterns. They were made in Imperial kilns controlled by the government - destroying some smaller businesses. The kilns boasted some of the most advanced technology in the . world. The vase is made from porcelain with green and yellow enamel and depicts eight bats flying among clouds and flowers. The vase was auctioned to an Asian art trader for £2.65 million, bringing the total including a buyer's premium to £3 million. It completely outstripped its £200,000 estimate, to the shock of the auctioneers. Mr Rasti added: 'Chinese ceramics is a very strong market but it has gone up another notch in recent years. 'A vase from this period in this shape and colour scheme is almost unheard of. 'On top of that, demand for quality Imperial ceramics is very, very high. 'Even . back then the vase would have been a very important piece that would . have featured in the house of an equally important Chinese figure.'",Mystery owner had no idea of its staggering value when she inherited it.

91440,"It suggests house prices will rise at an average of 5% a year, pricing the typical home at Â£360,000 by 2020.
Industry figures show that first-time buyers typically need to find a deposit of 18% to secure a mortgage.
Using PwC data, that would equate to a requirement for Â£64,800 in savings to get on the property ladder in 2020.
""Driven by a decade of soaring house prices before the financial crisis and lower loan-to-value ratios post-crisis, the deposits needed by first time buyers have risen significantly. As a result, a generation of private renters have emerged and this will increasingly be the norm for the 20 to 39 age group,"" said Richard Snook, senior economist at PwC.
""There is also a rising dichotomy in the market between those - mostly older - households who own outright and those - mostly younger - households who still have a mortgage or rent to pay.""
Ownership issues for young adults would become more acute owing to a lack of supply in affordable housing, the PwC report suggested.
The contrast between young and old would be marked by the number of people owning their homes having bought in cash or having paid off a mortgage.
The number of homes owned outright would rise from 8.4 million now to 10.6 million by 2025, accounting for 35% of the total, PwC said.
Overall, it predicted that the proportion of residents who owned the home they lived in would drop from its peak of 70% in the middle of the last decade to about 60% in 2025.
About 7.2 million households would be private tenants in 10 years' time, it suggested.
The recently-published English Housing Survey found that, in 2013-14, some 48% of households made up of 25 to 34-year-olds rented their home from a private landlord.
This had risen from 45% a year earlier, and from 21% in 2003-04.
Over the same 10 years, owner occupation in this age group dropped from 59% to 36%.
In 2013-14, of the 22.6 million households in England, 7.4 million owned their property outright, and 6.9 million had a mortgage, the survey showed. The rest rented their homes.

Theft: The Saudi diplomat was pulled over on the A1 motorway close to Paris by two armed men posing as police officers . The armed men demanded an inspection of the car boot and said they were 'confiscating' the suitcase before telling the official, who had just landed at the private Le Bourget airport on Monday, he was 'free to go'. A French police spokesman said: 'It is unclear why he was carrying so much cash. Newly arrived: The diplomat had landed only minutes earlier at Le Bourget airport close to Paris . 'We do not know if the robbers were working on a tip off or simply got lucky.' He confirmed that officers in the Seine-Saint-Denis department were investigating the theft. The robbery is the latest in a string of thefts on wealthy visitors to Paris.

83743,"The economy grew 7% from a year ago - matching growth in the first three months of the year, which was the lowest since 2009 when it fell to 6.6%.
A weaker property market and factory production have hampered growth.
But, Beijing has rolled out a series of stimulus measures amid the slowdown.
The central bank cut interest rates for the fourth time since November last month to boost economic activity.
Economists are, however, continuing to call for more easing despite the better-than-expected numbers as volatility in the stock markets has sparked concerns of financial turmoil in the country.
Growth was expected to dip below the 7% mark and come in at 6.9% for the April to June quarter.
Sure, the data may well be massaged, manipulated and to some extent made up.
And critics of the whole concept will argue that attempting to sum up three months' worth of Chinese economic growth in a single number is as futile as trying to sum up the political events of the past three months in a single word.
But if seen as simply the best estimate that China feels comfortable publishing then it is useful, both in terms of the trend and in terms of what it may tell us about government thinking.
The 7% figure is certainly confirmation that growth remains flat at best, unchanged since the first quarter, but coming in slightly above what many had been expecting, could it be a little more rose-tinted than usual?
A point or two added as perhaps another stock-market boosting measure?
Of course, it's too early to tell if those market woes are yet impacting the wider economy. Except, analysts suggest, in one small but surprising way; second quarter growth may actually have been boosted slightly by the huge brokerage fees earned on all that frantic, panicked trading.

Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC expects more fiscal and monetary easing in the coming months in order for China to achieve sustainable growth.
""Stimulus measures rolled out over the past nine months are beginning to show some traction. But work remains to be done,"" he told the BBC. ""The sell-off in the stock market will likely necessitate further easing in the coming months.""

The National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday that the data reflecting the positive changes in the economy was ""hard won"", and accurate.
Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics said that while actual growth is ""almost certainly"" a percentage point or two slower than the official figures show, it does point to signs of a stabilising economy.
""More broadly, with the drag from the structural slowdown in property and heavy industry now easing, we think that growth is on track to slow only gradually over the course of the next few years,"" he said in a note.
Industrial production and retail sales in June were all above forecasts, while fixed-asset investment, a major driver of the economy, also beat expectations in the period.","China's economy grew in the second quarter of the year, despite a slowdown in the economy."

50563,"By . Tamara Cohen . PUBLISHED: . 18:20 EST, 8 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:53 EST, 9 August 2013 . Debate: UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom has reignited the issue of Britain's foreign aid contributions with his infamous 'Bongo Bongo land' comments . David Cameron yesterday weighed into the row over an MEP’s ‘Bongo Bongo land’ comments by describing them as ‘offensive’ and ‘wrong’. Despite Godfrey Bloom being rebuked for his outburst by UKIP party bosses, he again refused to apologise for the remarks. The Prime Minister criticised Mr Bloom by describing Britain as a ‘very open, international country’. ‘I think it’s an offensive remark anyway, but I think that where he’s wrong is this sort of “stop the world I want to get off” approach – it just doesn’t work,’ he told the BBC’s Breakfast programme. ‘The problems elsewhere come and visit us so it makes sense to have an overseas aid programme that helps solve those problems at source.’ As the Prime Minister defended Britain’s international aid programme, one minister claimed that other members of the Government had been banned from commenting publicly on the issue. ‘We were told unequivocally not to criticise or get drawn into it’, the minister said. ‘We were told to just say it’s UKIP’s problem because we know when you strip away the “bongo bongo” comment, the public agree with him. ‘Our policy on international aid is unsaleable.’ Mr Bloom told supporters in the Midlands in July that foreign leaders who received aid spent the money on ‘Ray-Ban sunglasses, apartments in Paris, Ferraris and all the rest of it’. The 63-year-old MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber is recorded saying: ‘How we can possibly be giving a billion pounds a month when we’re in this sort of debt to Bongo Bongo land is completely beyond me.’ Condemnation: The Prime Minster said Mr Bloom's comments were offensive and wrong . Yesterday, Mr Cameron said there was a ‘totally legitimate debate to be had about whether it’s right to keep our promises on overseas aid’. He said Britain had promised ‘the poorest people in the world’ donations worth 0.7 per cent of GDP by 2015 ‘to eradicate appalling diseases’. As well as the moral case, he said ‘there’s actually a national self-interest that if we invest in these countries, for instance Somalia, we can stop the mass migration of more and more people turning up at our shores’. Mr Bloom, appearing on ITV yesterday, said his comments were ‘not racist at all’ and bizarrely claimed that the word bongo meant a ‘white antelope that lives in the forest’. He said: ‘Bongo land is the land of the antelope.’ Bongo is a type of antelope found in central Africa, but it is in fact a red-brown colour. Mr Bloom found support last night from Tory backbencher Philip Davies. ‘I wouldn’t have used those words but in terms of the substance of what he said, I don’t doubt the majority of the public would agree with him and I certainly do,’ he said. ‘Godfrey Bloom says he didn’t mean any offence so I’m happy to take his word on that.’",Godfrey Bloom said 'Bongo Bongo land' meant 'white antelope that lives in forest' Prime Minister said he was 'not racist at all' and 'wrong' in his outburst.
41454,"Dr David Nott from Trelech, Carmarthenshire, took the International award and Cairn Newton-Evans, of Ammanford, won the Citizenship award.
The annual ceremony took place in Cardiff on Thursday evening, with winners in nine categories.
It recognises the achievements of people in Wales from all walks of life.
While eight categories were nominated by the public, First Minister Carwyn Jones personally chose Sir Karl Jenkins and Dr Mererid Hopwood for his special award.
They composed the music and words for Cantata Memoria, a piece of choral work to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Aberfan disaster.
All of the winners were chosen from nominees that included Nizar Dahan from Swansea.
The 29-year-old from Sketty had been working in property development as a marketing consultant when the harrowing images of a three-year-old Syrian boy found drowned on a beach in Turkey drove him to act.
It led to him establishing the Swansea Humanitarian Aid Response Project - otherwise known as Sharp - made up of some 20 volunteers.
The project collects, sorts and delivers donations to displaced and vulnerable people in Swansea, across Wales and as far afield as Syria, Greece, Jordan, Libya, Syria and Ghana.
To date, it has sent out more than 130 tonnes of aid, helped more than 55 resettled families in Swansea and Mr Dahan has personally raised more than Â£100,000.
""Seeing the difference we have been able to make, as a small collective of normal people, to people around the world and in our local community, that's my main motivation,"" he said.
Mr Dahan has also set up a kitchen on the Island of Samos, Greece, feeding 1,500 people on a daily basis.
Since August 2016, he has worked for the Human Relief Foundation, going on several aid missions to Iraq.
""We were actually attacked by an Isis drone in the first week of February when we were out there,"" he said.
He explained how they were at a checkpoint in Mosul, helping to deliver clean drinking water as part of a joint project with Unicef, when the drone went off ""literally 1km from where we were standing"".
""I do [fear for my safety] but at the same time one of my colleagues when we first landed in Iraq said 'if you want to help other people, sometimes you have to risk your life'.
""I strongly believe in that. To me, it's important to get the help to the most vulnerable people out there.""
Mr Newton-Evans has been a passionate advocate for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights.
He was inspired to join the police force aged just 18 after being violently attacked in his hometown the previous year.
The 25-year-old said he joined the Special Constabulary for Dyfed-Powys Police as a volunteer in a bid to stop that kind of attack happening to other people.
""At the time I felt let down by the criminal justice system and was scared to leave the house. It really started to affect my mental health and wellbeing,"" he said.
""I decided to turn that negative experience in to a positive one.""
He is now a trained hate crime support officer, the deputy lead for the force's LGBT staff network and has formed an LGBT social project in Carmarthenshire to support and counsel people.
""After being a victim, I understand the damage that can have on an individual, their community and family and friends,"" he said.
""The opportunity to try and make a difference in my community, and in Wales as a whole, is really important to me.""
Mr Newton-Evans is also the youngest special chief officer in England and Wales, having been recently promoted to the highest rank possible within the Special Constabulary.
And alongside volunteering up to 50 hours a month with the police cadets, RAF cadets and as a theatre technician, he is also studying for a degree in law and public service at the University of Wales Trinity St David.
Another finalist was warzone surgeon Dr David Nott, from Trelech, Carmarthenshire, who was in the running for the International Award.
He is a consultant surgeon at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, performs vascular and trauma surgery at St Mary's Hospital and cancer surgery at the Royal Marsden Hospital.
For the past 23 years, he has been undertaking humanitarian work around the world, providing surgical treatment to victims of conflict in countries including Bosnia, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Haiti and Iraq.
He now teaches warzone surgery on the frontline, most recently teaching 63 Syrian surgeons on the Turkish-Syrian border.
But he also trains surgeons brought to the UK under his charity, The David Nott Foundation, which he founded with his wife Elly two years ago.
He said his work ""leaves a legacy"" by teaching doctors the skills needed to treat thousands of patients, who can then teach other doctors.
""I did my first mission in Sarajevo in 1993 and it lit a small humanitarian flame in my head which I was never able to put out,"" he explained.
""I work nine months of the year in the NHS and the three months I devote to humanitarian work.
""I just love it, it's a great thing to be able to treat people who can't have access to healthcare. Everybody deserves healthcare wherever they are in the world.""",A surgeon has been named as one of two Welsh people who have made a difference to the lives of people affected by the Aberfan disaster.
77150,"National Express was reported by the Bristol Post to have thrown a Muslim man off a bus last week when another passenger said they felt uncomfortable.
The firm denied the report and has used Twitter to reply to more than 450 people saying the man refused to stow excess luggage and then became abusive.
It said its staff were ""extremely upset"" at these ""untrue allegations"".
The incident happened on 3 December on a National Express coach travelling from Bristol to London.
The Bristol newspaper quoted two other passengers, including a university student who said the complaint was ""clearly made because of the man's religion"".
Nick MacDonald, another passenger on the coach, told BBC Radio Bristol the man had a lot of bags which drew a complaint from a woman who implied he was suspicious.
He said the driver asked the woman to go to the office if she had a complaint, which she did, and another National Express member of staff came to the bus and asked the man to leave.
""The man left relatively quietly but understandably used an expletive about it being ridiculous,"" Mr MacDonald added.
""Everyone on the bus was staring, and people were questioning did it really happen. It was obvious that it was down to the way he looked.""
According to National Express, the customer boarded with excess luggage which became an issue for ""a number of other passengers who complained"".
The customer involved was unhappy to put the extra items in the hold and became abusive towards staff who were attempting to resolve the issue, the firm said on its website.","A bus firm has been accused of ""ridiculous behaviour"" after a passenger complained about excess luggage."
96575,"Five former secretaries of state from both parties Monday discussed how they would advise the next president on a wide range of foreign policy, including relations with Russia, Iran and the Middle East. ""I would advise the president to fully engage with Syria,"" former Secretary of State James Baker said at a George Washington University forum co-sponsored by CNN. ""I think it's ridiculous for us to say we're not going to talk to Syria, and yet the Israelis have been negotiating peace with them for the last six or eight months."" Baker served under President George H.W. Bush. (The full comments will air on ""The Next President: A World of Challenges"" this Saturday night at 9 p.m. ET and again Sunday at 2 p.m. ET.) Baker, who has endorsed Republican Sen. John McCain's presidential bid, appeared with former Clinton secretaries of state Madeleine Albright and Warren Christopher; Henry Kissinger, who served under Nixon and Ford; and former Bush Secretary of State Colin Powell. Albright has been an active supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama. Powell, who said he has not decided which candidate to back this year, said Monday the election of an African-American president ""would be electrifying, but at the same time [I have to] make a judgment here on which would be best for America."" As the former diplomats urged a cautious approach in the conflict between Russia and Georgia, Powell seemed to take a swipe at McCain's tough criticism of Moscow. ""Some debate in the presidential elections has basically been, 'We are all Georgians now,' "" said CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour. ""What does that mean? It's the same as was said after 9/11."" Responded Powell, ""One candidate said that, and I'll let the candidate explain it for himself."" Pressed to explain his response, the retired general said the crisis called for caution. ""The fact of the matter is that you have to be very careful in a situation like this not just to leap to one side or the other until you take a good analysis of the whole situation.... ""The Russian Federation is not going to become the Soviet Union again. That movie failed at the box office. But they do have interests. And we have to think carefully about their interests."" When the crisis began in early August, the Obama campaign called ""for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict,"" echoing the statements from the White House and the European Union. Kissinger told the panel the United States needs ""Russia for resolution of the Iranian problem. We may need Russia if Pakistan evolves in some of the directions that it might."" ""I would urge the new president, as I'm urging this president, to explore the possibilities of cooperation and be very sure before we go the route of cutting off WTO [World Trade Organization] and the other international measures for which cooperation with Russia may be very important,"" he said. Baker said the U.S. needs to cooperate with Russia ""where we can, where it makes sense, but we ought to also be willing to confront them where our vital interests are involved. We are committed to the independence of these former republics of the former Soviet Union."" The former secretaries of state also focused their attention on talks with Iran.

It is understood the Welsh Government hoped another of the shortlisted candidates would be appointed in her place.
However, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has opted to re-advertise the position.
It emerged the Welsh Government had vetoed the preferred candidate to represent Wales on the new BBC Board last week.
The members for England and Scotland were confirmed last Thursday.
But a UK government source said the Welsh Government had ""seen fit to veto the secretary of state's choice of candidate"".
The Welsh Government said: ""Throughout the appointment process, our primary concern has been to ensure the BBC board properly represents the needs of the people of Wales.
""While we were unable to agree with the secretary of state's choice for the post of board member for Wales, we have made it clear there remain appointable candidates on whom we can agree.
""It is unfortunate that the secretary of state has been unwilling to have a proper dialogue with us about it. The latter stages of this process have been deeply unsatisfactory and we believe it is in both Wales and the BBC's interests that we now reopen the process.""

63092,"Karl Andree, 74, was arrested by Saudi religious police after being found in possession of homemade wine.
He has been in prison for more than a year and his family feared he would also be flogged, although Saudi officials denied this would happen.
Mr Hammond tweeted of his ""delight"" that Mr Andree was getting released.
The full tweet said: ""Delighted to announce Brit Karl Andree will be released from Saudi custody within a week & reunited with his family.""
Mr Andree, who has lived in the country for several years, has been in prison since his arrest in Jeddah in August last year
Mr Andree's family have previously made media appeals calling for his release, and they feared he would die if he received the 360 lashes to which he had been sentenced.
Simon Andree said he was ""absolutely thrilled"" at the news his father, who is a grandfather of seven, would be released.
""The Foreign Office called me this morning and told me Philip Hammond was in Saudi but they didn't tell me anything else,"" he said.
""I've been watching the TV all day waiting for the news.""
His daughter Kirsten Piroth said the news was a ""huge relief"", and that it had been a ""long, long year"" of worry.
Mr Hammond said: ""This is a good outcome and I'm grateful to minister Al-Jubeir and all other people who have been involved, especially His Royal Highness the Crown Prince, for ensuring that we now have a good outcome.""
Prime Minister David Cameron, who has previously raised the case with officials in Saudi Arabia, said: ""We have always acted on human rights and on British prisoners overseas, with all countries, not just Saudi Arabia, we raise these concerns.
""We try to do it diplomatically and carefully and in the end it's about getting a good result for a British citizen and I'm pleased that on this occasion this person has been released.""
Mr Hammond is currently visiting Saudi Arabia, at a time of heightened scrutiny of the UK's relationship with the country.
Saudi Arabia, where alcohol is illegal, has long been accused of human rights abuses, and has come under pressure from the UK over its treatment of both expats and Saudi nationals who have fallen foul of the country's Islamic laws.
The UK recently cancelled a Â£5.9m deal to provide ""training needs analysis"" for Saudi prison service staff.
The Saudi ambassador to the UK - Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf bin Abdulaziz - has previously warned of serious repercussions over what he described as an ""alarming change"" in the UK's attitude towards Saudi Arabia.
He said Saudi Arabia would ""not be lectured to by anyone"".
BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said Mr Hammond's visit was intended to ""smooth ruffled feathers"" because Saudi Arabia is an ""enormously important"" partner for the UK in terms of trade, intelligence and defence.
But the country was also a controversial partner, he said, not least because its ""human rights record is pretty awful"".
Controversial cases which have attracted media attention recently include that of Saudi national Ali Mohammed Baqir al-Nimr, whose case was raised with Mr Cameron by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
Mr al-Nimr was arrested when he was 17 in 2011 for taking part in an anti-government protest and now faces the death penalty.
A Foreign Office statement said Mr Hammond was in the region to meet with the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to discuss the crisis in Syria.
""During the Gulf visit, the foreign secretary will also discuss the ongoing conflict in Yemen,"" the statement added.
""As usual on all visits, he will raise consular cases, including current Saudi judicial cases.""
On Friday he will fly to Vienna for further talks about Syria with a host of other countries including the US, Iran, Germany and Jordan before heading to Bahrain at the weekend to give speech about extremism.","Philip Hammond has said he is ""grateful"" that a British prisoner in Saudi Arabia has been freed from prison."

Speaking to 702 ABC in Sydney, he explained how he came up with the idea.
""I was sitting in the lounge room and heard the news of Phillip Hughes' passing and [I was] overcome by grief like most cricket fans were.
""I looked in the corner and there was my bat, sitting there with the hat on. I picked it up and swung it round, upset and thought, 'How are we going to express this?'

""I thought nothing of it for a little while, and then decided to send it out there, to let people know, 'Hey, this is how I'm feeling.'
""I just can't believe how it took off.""
He went on to say that he had been ""very reluctant to talk to people because it's not about me"".

20993,"Bogus court papers that allowed two convicted murderers to walk out of a Florida prison are part of a ""cottage industry"" that enabled one other jailbreak and several more attempts, the state's police chief said Monday. ""We know today of five other instances"" in which Florida convicts used forged documents in an attempt to shave some time off their sentences, said Jerry Bailey, commissioner of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The seven instances of alleged forgery involve six inmates because one inmate was allegedly involved in two forgeries, authorities said Tuesday. Also Tuesday, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement announced a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those involved in the forgeries or inmates' escapes. And the Florida attorney general's office is offering another reward of up to $10,000. State officials have been investigating the scam for about a year and had warned prosecutors about the schemes over the summer, Bailey said. ""We have a confidential source that has advised us that there was a cottage industry, if you will,"" he said. ""An individual was able to construct these documents for $8,000."" Friend tipped off police to whereabouts of escaped Florida inmates . Authorities say Charles Walker and Joseph Jenkins, who were recaptured Saturday night, used a fraudulent order from a judge to get out of the prison in the Panhandle where they were serving life terms. In the past two years, three other inmates in that prison and one at another lockup have made similar attempts to get themselves released, Bailey said. One of those inmates, Jeffrey Forbes, now faces trial on forgery and attempted escape charges, Orange County State Attorney Jeffrey Ashton said. Forbes had been convicted of attempting to kill a law enforcement officer and had been sentenced to life in prison, Ashton said in a written statement last week. ""It is now clear that the use of forged court documents to obtain release from prison is an ongoing threat which all law enforcement, prosecutors, judges, court clerks and prison officials must address and stop,"" he said. An inmate held on stolen-check charges in St. Petersburg used fake papers to get out for about 24 hours in 2009 before being recaptured, Pinellas County prosecutors said. Walker and Jenkins were taken into custody Saturday evening in Panama City, where they were waiting for a ride to arrive from Atlanta. Bailey said they are not cooperating with the inquiry, and investigators are tracking their forged paperwork ""to try to determine who initiated the fraud and who along the way may have harbored these fugitives."" The investigation includes the use of DNA tests on the documents in hopes of trying to figure out who produced them, he said. He said investigators have identified suspects but aren't prepared to make arrests. Walker and Jenkins are both 34 and had been serving life terms without parole for unrelated killings. Jenkins left the prison in North Carrabelle, south of Tallahassee, on September 27, and Walker left on October 8, according to authorities. A tip from an acquaintance of one of them led to their arrests at a Panama City motel, Bailey said. The legal-looking documents the men used contained bogus reproductions of several key players' signatures, including those of Ashton or the assistant state attorney and Belvin Perry, the chief judge for Florida's 9th Judicial Circuit, which includes Orange and Osceola counties. They bore the seal of the Orange County clerk of court's office. ""They are excellent fakes,"" Perry said. The judge said his signature is easy to find online on documents related to the high-profile trial of Casey Anthony. Anthony was acquitted in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. ""People, particularly people with criminal minds, come up with ingenious ways to beat the system,"" Perry said. ""They have nothing but time on their hands to think of things."" In an order issued Monday, Perry laid out new rules for county clerks in his circuit to keep fake orders from getting real inmates released, requiring them to confirm an order in writing with the judge's office. And Mike Crews, the head of Florida's Department of Corrections, said he has ordered prison officials to check with the judge to make sure a release order is legitimate. CNN's Kim Segal, Matt Smith and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: Authorities offer reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to convictions.

59642,"The 51-year-old tourist was attacked by a group of men in the Paharganj area on Tuesday evening. Police say she was robbed and raped at knife point.
A German woman has also been raped in south India, Der Spiegel reports.
Scrutiny of sexual violence in India has grown since the 2012 gang rape and murder of a student on a Delhi bus.
By Andrew NorthBBC News, Delhi
It's hard to imagine a worse headline for India's image abroad, after the battering it has taken over the issue of rape.
After the fatal assault on a Delhi student just over a year ago, the city has earned the unwelcome title ""India's rape capital"". The picture is not as bad as the media paints, Indian officials say.  Other countries also have a rape problem, they protest.
But ever since the Delhi gang-rape case, the safety of women and the discrimination they suffer in Indian society has been in the spotlight.  The Indian media just as much as the foreign media are giving the issue much more space.
And while the case involving the Danish woman is getting priority attention from the Delhi police, many say what's still needed is the justice system and Indian society in general to take the issue more seriously.
The government tightened laws on sexual violence last year after widespread protests following the attack.
But violence and discrimination against women remain deeply entrenched in India's staunchly patriarchal society.
The Danish woman told police that she approached the group of men after losing her way back to her hotel near New Delhi Railway Station.
The men robbed her of her belongings and raped her, police spokesman Rajan Bhagat told the BBC.
""She reached her hotel and reported the incident to the manager who called in the police and the investigation is now under way,"" Mr Bhagat said.
The woman flew out of India on Wednesday morning, police say.
No arrests have been made yet, but police are questioning a number of men in connection with the attack.
The Danish woman is believed to have been travelling alone and had been in Delhi since Monday after visiting the Taj Mahal, the BBC's Andrew North in Delhi reports.
Police say she gave a detailed statement in the presence of the Danish ambassador before leaving the country, AFP news agency reports. There was no immediate comment from the Danish embassy in Delhi.
Paharganj, a busy backpacker district frequented by foreign tourists, is located in the heart of the Indian capital, not far from Connaught Place.
An 18-year-old German woman was reportedly raped by a man sharing her compartment on a train travelling from Mangalore to Chennai in southern India on Friday.
A man, described as a migrant worker from Bihar state, was arrested on Tuesday, Der Spiegel newspaper reported.
Last March a Swiss tourist was gang raped and her partner attacked by a group of men in Madhya Pradesh state. Six men were jailed for life for the attack in July.
Since the December 2012 Delhi gang rape, the nation has been shocked by a string of brutal rapes of Indian women.
They include a photojournalist raped in broad daylight in central Mumbai, a 21-year-old woman raped by two apparently unrelated groups of men on Christmas Eve in Pondicherry and a 16-year-old girl who died after being gang-raped twice and then set on fire in the eastern city of Calcutta.
Although cases involving foreigners continue to get far more attention in the media and from the police, Indian women who are raped are still far less likely to receive justice, our correspondent says.","A Danish woman has been raped in the Indian capital, Delhi, police say."

80477,"Mutko has been outspoken since the McLaren report alleged there had been a state-backed Russian doping programme.
Part of the report outlines samples taken from two women's ice hockey players that contained male DNA.
""If you have sex five days before taking a doping test, they can find male DNA in you,"" said Mutko.
""If a female athlete undergoes a drug test within five days after the act, then the test will show that she has male hormones - and yet it evokes suspicions of her using different drugs.""
Former World Anti-Doping Agency vice-president Arne Ljungqvist said DNA is ""very personal"" and ""cannot be shared via sex"".
In saying Russian athletes were unfairly treated, Mutko drew comparison with the cases of Canadian pole vault world champion Shawn Barber and French tennis player Richard Gasquet, who avoided punishment after blaming positive drugs tests for cocaine on kissing women who had ingested the banned substance.
""One [athlete] can kiss a girl who has taken a drug. A foreign [athlete] is reinstated based on this while a Russian is punished,"" Mutko told Russian publication Sport-Express.
The McLaren report states more than 1,000 Russians - including Olympic medallists - benefited from a state-sponsored doping programme between 2011 and 2015.
It found two female Russian ice hockey players at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi had male urine samples.
Russia has repeatedly denied the claims but 19 national anti-doping organisations last week said the country should be banned from both competing in and hosting international sporting events.

Washington said it's sticking with Georgia. ""As to choosing, the United States has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of Georgia,"" Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Wednesday. She spelled out the Bush administration's stance after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called Georgia's government ""a special project for the United States."" ""And we are aware that the U.S. is uptight about this project,"" Lavrov said in remarks broadcast on Russian television. ""But a choice will have to be made someday between considerations of prestige related to an illusory project and a real partnership in matters which indeed require collective efforts."" Rice, amid reports that Russian troops remained on the move Wednesday, pushed Russia to abide by a cease-fire signed Tuesday by the Russian and Georgian presidents. Russian military action in Georgia ""must stop and must stop now,"" Rice said. Rice said Moscow already faced ""quite significant"" diplomatic consequences over its conflict with Georgia before Tuesday's cease-fire agreement, which calls for Russian and Georgian troops to return to pre-conflict positions. Bush said reports he had received were contrary to Russian assurances that it had halted military operations. Bush said he was told the Russian military had blocked Georgia's major east-west highway, and had soldiers at the main port at Poti. There were reports that some ships had been attacked, he said. Russia has likely moved additional troops into the disputed Georgian provinces and into Georgia proper over the past several days, several administration officials told CNN on Wednesday. The officials said the United States now believes Russia may have 15,000 or more troops in the region. That would be an increase from the 8,000-10,000 the U.S. government estimated when the fighting began. A Bush administration official stressed that the scope of Russia's military effort remains unclear. Any violations of the cease-fire would call into question Russia's ""suitability"" as an international partner, Rice told reporters before leaving on a diplomatic trip to Europe. Bush administration officials told CNN the United States and its European allies were considering kicking Russia out of the G-8, the group of the world's largest industrial economies, and other international organizations as punishment for its actions in Georgia. Rice discounted concerns that Moscow would no longer assist Washington on thorny diplomatic issues such as efforts to halt nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea, saying it had its own interests at stake.

Harris has abandoned his push to appeal 12 convictions for sexually assaulting four girls in the United Kingdom, after failing to ask for a hearing before three Appeal Court judges . A Judicial Office spokesman on Monday confirmed  that Harris hadn't renewed his application to appeal 'and he is now out of time'. The 84-year-old Australian had 28 days to ask for a hearing before three Appeal Court judges but chose not to. Among his victims was an eight-year-old autograph hunter, two teenage girls and a friend of his daughter whom he abused for over 16 years. Jurors were told that the ongoing sexual abuse against his daughter's friend 'haunted' her and made her abandon her dreams. During the trial, Harris was described as an ‘octopus’ because of his reputation for wandering hands and his systematic abuse of young girls than spanned over a quarter of a century. After he was exposed, Harris was stripped of his BAFTA fellowship and a number of other honours. The formerly celebrated performer now faces losing his CBE, a prestigious award  he received from the Queen in 2006.

During his lengthy trial another six women gave supporting evidence that Harris abused them in Australia, New Zealand and Malta between 1969 and 1991. Harris wasn't charged over those alleged incidents because they occurred outside the UK. In mid-October a British newspaper reported Harris could face fresh charges as a result of more than 10 new victims claiming they were abused by the disgraced artist and singer. It was claimed Operation Yewtree officers were looking at the British cases while any assaults that took place in Australia or New Zealand would be handled by local police. The Metropolitan police have refused to comment on the possibility of further charges being laid. It was also reported in mid-October that Harris had to be moved to a new prison for his own safety after being bullied by inmates.

A 'peeping Tom' who broke into Brisbane homes to film himself next to sleeping women and children has been jailed for at least eight years. John William Goodwin, 41, was convicted of breaking into 38 homes and filming 62 women and children over seven years until September 2012. He filmed his victims, aged eight to 50, while they were sleeping, on the toilet and as they undressed, Brisbane District Court was told on Friday. Crown prosecutor Michael Byrne said Goodwin's actions were predatory and were made worse because the women did not know they were being filmed, the Courier Mail reports. Goodwin's predatory side was discovered after police traced child pornography featuring an eight-year-old victim being sold to a Russian website. Police found a computer cache of 1.5 million files that Goodwin had created including 154,000 child exploitation photos, 1,193 child exploitation videos and a number of 'peeping Tom' files. His victims lived in homes up to 2km away and videos showed him climbing up trees, fences, pergolas and gates to film the female targets whose names he spent time researching. The court was told Goodwin also sexually assaulted some of his victims and filmed himself pulling at their blankets and touching them as they slept. The films sometimes showed Goodwin performing a sexual act on himself. His barrister Damien Carlton tried to justify Goodwin's behaviour by saying he was offending for his own 'voyeuristic sexual gratification' that started when he was young. Detective Inspector John Rouse said outside court that Goodwin's sentencing marked the end of a long and challenging police investigation. 'I can't imagine that any member of the public, if they had viewed some of the images and videos that we saw, would not be alarmed about the invasions of privacy that have occurred here, in the sanctity of their own homes,' he said.","John William Goodwin, 41, convicted of breaking into 38 homes in Brisbane.

Tragic: Sandra Lommen was found barely conscious on Wednesday morning after trying to walk home from a party two miles from her dorm . Tragically, police in Bemidji said they believe she managed to get herself out of the creek, but succumbed to the cold afterwards, passed out and was pronounced dead at Sanford Medical Center. Police also announced that a criminal investigation has been launched because Lommen was believed to be drunk and was under 21. The popular freshman was enrolled in nursing school and police are keen to talk to whoever was at the party she attended on Tuesday night. The student lived less than two miles from where she was found in the woods and was 'dressed appropriately for what she had intended to do, which was walk home,” said Police Chief Mike Mastin. On being transported to hospital, Mastin said he detected an odour of alcohol on her breath. Addressing the media, he said this just shows young people that 'you need to take care of youself' while drinking and walking home in the cold.

A drug user high on PCP stabbed a 19-year-old college student 13 times after he grew paranoid as she gave him and his infant daughter a lift to hospital, a court has heard. Julio Miguel Blanco Garcia is accused of bringing Vanessa Pham's 'young life to a horrific end', prosecutors said on the opening day of his trial in Fairfax County, Virginia, yesterday. They have asked jurors to find the day labourer guilty of the first-degree murder of Falls Church teenager, who was found dead in the driver's seat of her car on June 27, 2010. Scroll down for video . Caught: Julio Miguel Blanco Garcia, left, is on trial for the 2010 stabbing death of Vanessa Pham, right, after an April 2012 arrest for stealing champagne provided police with matching fingerprints on the murder weapon . Blanco Garcia denies the charge of . Miss Pham's premeditated murder, but has admitted knifing her to death . in a drug-fuelled fury after he begged her to drive him and his daughter . to hospital. 'This is not a . case that is about who,' defence attorney Alberto Salvado said in his . opening statement yesterday, according to the Washington Post. 'This is a . case about why. It is a perfect storm of tragedy.' For two and a half years Miss Pham's killing remained one of the area's most notorious unsolved murders. Despite . finding the murder weapon with fingerprints under the driver's seat, . the DNA evidence didn't match anyone in the police database. A . break in the case came only in April 2012 when Julio Miguel Blanco . Garcia was arrested for stealing three bottles of Moet & Chandon . champagne from a McLean, Virginia shop. It wasn't until last December that investigators matched Blanco Garcia's prints to the DNA found on the murder weapon and arrested the man. Blanco Garcia's trial for Miss Pham's murder began yesterday. Initially, his lawyers tried to get the case dismissed, claiming that the media's coverage of the investigation tainted their client's ability to receive a fair trial since nearly all of the evidence in the case was released before a jury was selected. Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Marum Roush dismissed that claim Thursday, saying all of the evidence reported in The Washington Post would come out in trial and that jury members could set aside what they learned in the press. Taken: Pham was home for the summer, looking forward to a new babysitting job and a visit from her boyfriend when she was stabbed to death giving Blanco Garcia a ride . Pham had just returned home for the summer after her first year studying fashion design at the Savannah College of Art and Design. She was living with her mother at their apartment in Falls Church, and had just landed a babysitting gig for the summer the same day she was killed. Pham was also looking forward to a visit from her boyfriend Aaron Apsley who lived in Ohio. Around 2:45 p.m. she decided to go to the Fairfax Plaza Shopping Center to get her eyebrows done at JD Nail Salon. It was while leaving the salon that she first encountered Blanco Garcia, standing outside holding his 1-year-old daughter. Garcia started his day by going into Washington, D.C. with his daughter to buy $400 dollars of PCP. When he got home he smoked three cigarettes dipped in liquid PCP before going to the mall with his daughter. According . to court documents, by the time he approached Pham outside the mall, he . was having a 'severe PCP intoxication' and asked the young woman to . take him and his daughter to the hospital. Surveillance footage subsequently shows Pham's white Scion exiting the parking lot. Taken for a ride: Pham agreed to take Blanco Garcia and his 1-year-old daughter to the hospital, but was found less than a mile away stabbed to death in her crashed car . According to an account given to police by Blanco Garcia, Pham accidentally took a wrong turn and he overreacted. 'Vanessa did nothing wrong,' a detective paraphrased Blanco Garcia in a report made after his arrest. At . this point, Blanco Garcia was hallucinating and believed that Pham was . going to harm his daughter or call the police, so he acted. He . took out a butcher's knife from his backpack and stabbed the girl 13 . times which caused her to lose control of the vehicle and crash into a . ravine on the side of the road. Blanco Garcia ditched the knife and left Pham to die, fleeing from the vehicle with his daughter through the sunroof. A . driver spotted the car at 3:34pm, less than half a mile from the mall . and called police. When police arrived, they found Pham belted into her . seat and covered in blood with one wheel of the car still spinning. But police were stumped when it came to finding the suspect. Severely intoxicated: Blanco Garcia has spent his day traveling into Washington D.C. to buy $400 dollars of PCP with his daughter, and had smoked three cigarettes dipped in the drugs before going to the shopping center . Even though the knife was left in the car, the DNA evidence produced no matches in the police database. Investigators were certain the killer was a stranger since they had no reason to believe Pham had any enemies or was in any trouble. They canvassed the area around the mall and collected DNA from Pham's friends and family, local sex offenders and homeless people around the mall, but again, no matches. Pham's story was even highlighted on TV show 'America's Most Wanted' to no avail. It wasn't until almost two years later that Blanco Garcia was arrested for stealing two bottles of Moet & Chandon champagne at a grocery store in McLean, Virginia. Even then, it took police until last December 10 to make the connection with his prints. '[Blanco Garcia] was arrested in April for larceny of champagne. Imagine that!' wrote Fairfax County police detective Robert Bond in an email that day. A few days later Blanco Garcia was arrested at his job site in Vienna, Virginia. He said he never told anyone about the killing. A search of Blanco Garcia's computer showed that he tracked news of the investigation on his computer. Blanco Garcia has not yet entered a plea.

39547,"It is the last place you'd wish to be on a starless night.
They say that on one such night a fellow was playing cards with a stranger at the club when he happened to glance away from his hand and down to the stranger's foot on the floor.
He spied a cloven hoof... and an icy hand clutched his heart.
Hell-fire clubs have always been shrouded in rumours of devil worship and dark satanic deeds. How do you separate fact from fiction?
Drive out of south Dublin and climb Mountpelier Hill and there, on top, squats the shell of the old hunting lodge built for Irish Parliamentary Speaker William Connolly in 1725.
Now, a team of archaeologists are excavating the site to find out more about two prehistoric passage tombs on the hill - similar to Newgrange in Ireland's Boyne Valley.
To build the lodge, they say that Connolly's workmen used stones from the ancient passage tombs - their destruction marks the start of the association of the site with the supernatural.
Local legend has it that the devil was so enraged by the desecration that he blew off the wooden roof of the lodge in a storm.
After Connolly's death, his widow leased the building to the Earl of Rosse, Richards Parsons, in 1735. He was one of the leading figures in the Dublin Hellfire Club - also known as The Blasters or the Young Bucks of Dublin.
They were a group of aristocrats, described at the time by Gulliver's Travels writer Jonathan Swift as ""a brace of monsters, blasphemers and Bacchanalians"".
Among his other proclivities, it was said that Rosse liked to receive guests in the nude - him, not them.
The club was one of many in both England and Ireland where rich young rakes indulged in ceremonial drinking and dining and gambling and carousing.
But a few clubs crossed the line into sex, blasphemy and sheer bloody badness - or so the rumour goes.
The first hellfire club was set up by the Duke of Wharton and specialised in daring deeds like playing cards on Sunday, reading Lucretius and eating pigeon - known as ""Holy Ghost"" - pie, as chronicled in The Hellfire Clubs: Sex, Satanism and Secret Societies by Evelyn Lord.
The most notorious club was formed by Sir Francis Dashwood with the motto ""Fais ce que tu voudrais"" - Do as you will.
Dashwood's club included some of Britain's most senior statesmen and aristocrats. They met in a series of underground caves in West Wycombe and, legend has itindulged in lot of risque behaviour with the strict proviso: ""What goes on underground, stays underground.""
His club was called the Monks or Friars of St Francis of Wycombe. It was anything but saintly and involved drinking, wenching and banqueting.
Later, there were suggestions of ritual abuse of women and Black Masses  - but perhaps people with an axe to grind would be keen to spread such rumours.
Aisling Tierney, from Limerick, who has just finished a PhD in Bristol on the hellfire clubs, has been working on untangling the web of rumour and gossip and establishing the archaeological truth.
Her interest was sparked when she came upon a copy of Geoffrey Ashe's Hell-Fire Clubs: A History of Anti-Morality in a second hand bookshop. The spark lit a fire.
The clubs appeared in waves, first in London in the 1720s, then in Dublin and Limerick in the 1740s and then the Dashwood club of the 1750s, she said.
People associated them with what was going morally wrong in society. ""There were parties, revels and prostitutes. There was sexual energy and drinking,"" she said.
But to what extent were there acts of blasphemy?
She points to a painting of Sir Francis Dashwood by Hogarth.
""He is portrayed as St Francis at prayer, but the Bible in front of him has been replaced by an erotic novel, A halo above his head shows a picture of his friend, the Earl of Sandwich, a miniature naked woman in front of him lies in what looks like the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa.""
At that time, blasphemy against Catholicism was permitted, she pointed out. But were they actually Satan worshippers?
""The newspapers of the time had stories of the devil walking among them and those stories spread like wildfire in the 1720s and even reached papers in the New World,"" she said.
""Yes, there was gossip and rumour, but there was no actual physical evidence to suggest they viewed themselves as devil worshippers.""
In Ireland, the Dublin Hellfire Club first met on Cork Hill at the Eagle tavern.
In an article for the Irish Times, David Ryan-  author of the book, Blasphemers Blackguards: The Irish Hellfire Clubs -  calls the founder, the Earl of Rosse "" a notorious libertine fond of playing outrageous practical jokes on members of the clergy"".
""On one occasion he stripped naked to receive a visit from the eminent clergyman Samuel Madden, co-founder of the Dublin Society (now the Royal Dublin Society),"" he writes.
""Another of the club's members, James Worsdale, was an artist, playwright and womaniser. Once, on a visit to Mallow, he made a little too free with his landlady's daughter, causing the irate mother to beat him through the town with a hot shoulder of mutton. So far, so frivolous.""
But there was a much darker side to the club - it was a place where young rich aristocrats could get away, literally, with murder.
""When we come to one of the club's younger members, Henry, fourth Baron Barry of Santry, things start to get more sinister,"" writes Ryan.
""Lord Santry was civil enough - when sober. When intoxicated, as he often was, a much darker side was revealed. One of his most shocking crimes was the murder of an ill and bedridden servant. Having forced the unfortunate man to drink a bottle of brandy, Santry drenched his bedclothes in alcohol and set them alight, burning him alive. He escaped punishment by buying the silence of witnesses.""
And out of dirty deeds like this, the hellfire club got its gory reputation and cast a long shadow down the years.
There is a tale that a young local farmer was curious about what happened and was found by club members wondering about. They dragged him inside and allowed him to see - the next morning he was found wondering on the mountain, unable to speak and he remained deaf and dumb for the rest of his life.
There are stories of a black cat with ears like horns and evil eyes who took on a priest and still haunts the place - he is, they say, the size of a large Dalmatian.
However David Ryan states that although the club members were rumoured to be devil worshippers, ""in reality they were freethinkers who believed in neither heaven or hell"".
Aisling Tierney is equally sceptical about the satanic line. However, there is evidence that the Dublin lodge had an additional room added on.
""Maybe it was about being able to continue the party into the wee hours and collapsing into bed,"" she said.
Nevertheless, the rumours are rife and the Dublin hellfire club's reputation for black magic and mystery and heinous goings on echoes down the years.","It's a dark place, a dark place, a dark place, a dark place, a dark place, a dark place, a dark place, a dark place, a dark place, a dark place, a dark place, a dark place, a dark place, a dark place, a dark place, a dark place, a dark place, a dark place, a dark place, a dark place, a dark place, a dark place."

""This has not been the case and we now have to accept and fully respect his decision which we know hasn't been an easy one.""
After they got back together, the band were briefly rejoined by Robbie Williams for the 2010 album Progress.

41095,"Perinatal health covers the time during which a woman is pregnant and up to two years after she gives birth.
Post-natal mental illness, or as it is commonly known, post-natal depression, affects around one in ten mothers here.
Dr Janine Lynch said the current situation is serious.
Post-natal mental illness can be chronic, even life-threatening, when a woman is not offered specialist treatment in either a hospital or by specially trained staff.
Dr Lynch says the current situation is serious: ""Women's lives are being put at risk due to the lack of specialist care. And none can be treated alongside their baby when they are feeling at their most vulnerable. Mother and baby have to be separated.""
At the moment Northern Ireland does not have an inpatient specialist mother and baby unit. In fact there is only one specialist psychiatrist for the entire region.
Therefore when a woman is admitted to hospital for post-natal depression treatment they are separated from their baby.
According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, on average, 75 Northern Ireland mothers per year require admission to hospital.
Speaking on behalf of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Dr Lynch said this was unfair.
""In Belfast, women have access to a limited service,"" she said.
""We could do a lot more if we'd more resources, and in all of the other trusts in Northern Ireland, women have no access to specialist dedicated help.""
It is understood that the college has met at least five different health ministers over a period of 15 years, campaigning for a specialist mother and baby unit. But Dr Lynch said their calls have fallen on deaf ears.
""They listen and nod, but sometimes you just think they aren't treating it seriously. It is serious - women can die.""
The health minister told the BBC that he was aware of the problem and was attempting to find a way to resolve it.
Lindsey Robinson discovered she had post-natal depression two years after the birth of her son, Reuben.
She told the BBC: ""Normally I'm quite a confident and easy going person, but I became fearful of everything. I just didn't know who I'd become.
""I looked at myself in the mirror and I didn't recognise who was looking back at me. I was a mess.""
She said the illness impacted both her mental and physical wellbeing.
""I woke each day and thought, 'All I have to do is survive another day until I can get back into bed'.""

2733,"A woman who tried to smuggle almost £3million-worth of fake toothbrushes and razor blades has been sentenced to 15 months in prison. Jocelyn Hunter was caught trying to illegally import the Oral B toothbrushes and Gillette Fusion razor blades in a complex scam which took place over the course of a year. The 42-year-old from Swindon, Wiltshere, bought the bathroom products - which had not been tested for cancer-causing chemicals - from dodgy suppliers in China. Dodgy goods: Jocelyn Hunter was sentenced to 15 months in prison for importing nearly £3million worth of fake toothbrushes and razor blades (pictured) Hunter then flogged the items  which had an estimated 'street value' of £2.7million to customers in mainland Europe. She believed it would be easier to get the illegal goods into the continent through Britain's 'lax' border security. Her operation was discovered when customs officers seized the goods at the Coventry Postal Hub and informed the brand holder, Proctor and Gamble. At the time of her arrest, a large box of counterfeit Oral B toothbrush heads was found in her living room. The large-scale scame lasted between May 2 and June 30, 2011 - during which time she received 248 parcels from China. John Jacobs, from Scambusters South West, said: 'The sentence reflects the seriousness of the offences Hunter has been convicted of and this case demonstrates the varied and widespread nature of counterfeiting activity. Illegal import: 42-year-old Hunter from Swindon, Wiltshere, made contact with dodgy suppliers in China who provided her with the fake bathroom products (pictured) 'It is far from a victimless crime, not only are they of a significantly inferior quality they are often produced by workers barely able to survive on the wages received.' Lord Toby Harris, Chair of National Trading Standards, said: 'It is great news that this criminal has been brought to justice and I commend all parties involved. 'People are often lured in by the promise of a bargain but many counterfeit products, while they may look like the real thing, can be very low quality and in some cases unsafe. 'I would urge people to help National Trading Standards to catch these criminals by remaining vigilant and reporting any products they think may be counterfeit to their local trading standards office or Citizens Advice.'","Jocelyn Hunter, 42, tried to illegally import Oral B toothbrushes and razor blades.

12377,"Mike Ashley is considering Alan Pardew’s future from his holiday home in Barbados after being told the Newcastle manager wants to quit St James’ Park. Pardew, who ducked the post match press conference after the dramatic 3-2 victory against Everton on Sunday, hopes he will be allowed to leave by mutual consent to join Crystal Palace. Despite a fixed £5million compensation clause in his contract, which still has six years to run, he will appeal to the Newcastle owner's compassionate side to let him walk away from the club after four years in charge. Alan Pardew is the bookmakers' favourite to take over from Neil Warnock at Selhurst Park . Pardew applauds the home crowd after Newcastle's 3-2 win against Everton at St James' Park . Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, who is currently in Barbados, will have the final say on Pardew's future . Pardew played more than 100 games for Palace during a four-year spell at the south London club . Pardew made 128 league appearances between 1987 and 1991, scoring eight goals. The highlight of his time at Selhurst Park, however, was the FA Cup run in the 1989-90 season. Pardew was one of the 'Fab Four' (with Mark Bright, Gary O'Reilly and Andy Gray) and scored the winner against Liverpool in that memorable 4-3 semi-final victory at Villa Park (the other three also netted in that match). The Eagles pushed Manchester United all the way in the Wembley final, drawing 3-3 in the first match, but lost 1-0 in the replay. Pardew played every minute of both matches. Pardew has faced various campaigns calling for his resignation or dismissal by sections of supporters throughout his turbulent reign at the club. Ashley, who did not attend the victory over Everton on Sunday, is plotting his next move from his holiday retreat. The billionaire is wary of the upheaval if he allows his manager to quit the club and will also need to find a replacement prepared to work under his demanding ways. Ashley could yet play hardball and demand the £5m compensation from Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish, but the Eagles are unlikely to agree to that. Pardew is known to be frustrated after being told at a transfer meeting held around four weeks ago that there will not be any money to spend in January. Instead there is the possibility that Moussa Sissoko will leave in January after Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain declared an interest in the France midfielder. Pardew played a prominent role in Palace's recording of Glad All Over in the build up to the 1990 FA Cup final . The former Crystal Palace midfielder played for the south east London club from 1987 until 1991 . Newcastle are ninth in the Barclays Premier League following the victory over Everton and Ashley is happy with the team’s progress following their poor start to the season. Pardew, who wants to progress and challenge for honours, expected Ashley to make funds available to strengthen the team. Instead the Newcastle owner, who has an excellent relationship with his manager, appears content with the current squad. Pardew, who joined Palace in the Eighties and went on to score the winner in the FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool in 1990, is currently at his family home in Surrey waiting for Ashley to make his move. Pardew (No 11) scores the winning goal for Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool . Pardew chose not to speak to the press following Sunday’s 3-2 win over Everton and he would have been aware that such a stance would fuel speculation linking him with a return to south east London. He returned south on Sunday night after Newcastle’s 3-2 victory over Everton, but is expected to be at the training ground on Tuesday morning as things stand. His first team players were given the day off after a hectic Christmas schedule, but the rest of the squad - including non-playing substitutes - reported for work.

1791,"The 49-year-old is due to begin filming the new series of the motoring show in the next few weeks. It could easily catapult him from being a national celebrity to a global star.
Jeremy Clarkson is a hard act to follow - especially when the pair are close friends - but even former Top Gear presenter Chris Goffey said Evans was ""the obvious choice"".
""Who else in TV is really clued up about the cars and who's got a persona to match Jeremy's?"" he told the BBC.
Evans is a notorious petrolhead, with a passion for Ferraris and a large collection of vintage motors.
Among the cars he's owned are the original Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and James Hunt's winning Formula 1 Hesketh 308.
He has also paid record sums for his vehicles -  in 2010 he splashed out £12m for a 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO, considered the ""Holy Grail"" for many collectors.
His passion led him to set up CarFest last year - a family-friendly festival featuring cars, food and music to help raise money for the BBC's Children in Need campaign.
It's not bad for a newspaper delivery boy and ""Tarzan-o-gram"" from Warrington.
Rise to fame
Evans built his reputation as a witty prankster on the BBC's now-defunct London radio station GLR, where he started as a producer and ended up as a star DJ.
But it was in 1992, when he became host of Channel 4's early morning programme The Big Breakfast, that he became a household name.
The anarchic, primary-coloured magazine show was a huge hit in the early days, even beating ITV's new breakfast station, GMTV, when it launched in 1993.
Evans' hyperactive personality defined the show, and he was catapulted from London cult personality to national celebrity.
He launched his own production outfit, Ginger Productions, and moved into prime-time with Channel 4 game show Don't Forget Your Toothbrush which was sold around the world, bringing in funds to help him build up his media empire.
Evans left The Big Breakfast in 1994, and the following year was recruited by BBC Radio 1 to revamp the station's breakfast show. However, he took the job  on the proviso the show would be in the hands of Ginger Productions - and not the BBC.
The deal ruffled feathers at Broadcasting House but his confidence and naughtiness worked wonders for the station, which saw its ratings rocket along with its profile.
In 1996, he returned again to Channel 4 screens with TFI Friday - a classic Evans cocktail of music, celebrity chat, bizarre stunts and in-jokes.
But as TFI took off, his love affair with the BBC grew tempestuous.
His effortless, off-the-cuff banter slowly transformed into ego-centric rants, and the tone of the show became ever more dark. On one occasion, he said he hated Anthea Turner's new TV show so much he wanted to ""kick her in the mouth"".
After lots of highly publicised public drinking, he resigned live on air in 1997  - largely because Radio 1 refused to meet his demands to work a four-day week.
Later that year he returned to breakfast radio on Sir Richard Branson's Virgin station, competing against Radio 1's new breakfast line-up of Zoe Ball and Kevin Greening.
Evans liked the job so much he bought Virgin Radio from Sir Richard at the end of 1997 for £85m - snatching the station from under the nose of London-based Capital Radio, whose bid had been held up by a government inquiry.
With City backers behind him, his new Ginger Media Group made him a broadcasting multi-millionaire mogul. However the Evans magic started to fade soon afterwards and Ginger's TV arm showed signs of losing its flair.
TFI Friday started to go off the boil, and two BBC projects - the National Lottery Red Alert and student quiz Carry on Campus - flopped.
In early 2000 Evans sold the Ginger Media Group to SMG, the owner of ITV stations Scottish and Grampian, for £225m. But while Evans took a large chunk of that cash, his on-air performances faltered.
'I was an idiot'
A much-hyped ""romance"" with former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell failed to lift TFI's ratings, and he stepped down as host before the show ended in 2000.
At Virgin, meanwhile, Evans failed to turn up for a week of breakfast shows.
The DJ claimed he had been ill, but when photographs and footage emerged of him out drinking with his new teenage girlfriend Billie Piper, Virgin said it had no option but to dismiss him.
""I was stupid, no doubt about that,"" he told the BBC in 2009 while promoting his autobiography.
""I wasn't a very well behaved boy at those times. I was trying to figure out how come I had this brilliant career and messed it up?
""It was because I was an idiot - there's no point sugar coating it.""
After marrying Piper in Las Vegas in May 2001, Evans kept an uncharacteristically low profile at his marital home in Hascombe, Surrey. The marriage did not last, though, and the couple eventually divorced in 2007.
In 2003, Evans made a faltering return to primetime Saturday night TV as producer of the poorly received Boys and Girls.
The Channel 4 game show, billed as the ultimate battle of the sexes, was mauled by the critics and failed to match the success of his earlier TV hits.
But Evans began to slowly rebuild his public image as the host of the Brit Awards and by securing a Saturday afternoon programme on BBC Radio 2.
When he took over Johnnie Walker's drivetime show on the station in 2006, it prompted a flurry of complaints. One listener wrote Evans was ""just a gob, a loud one at that, he can't entertain and he can't just deliver to the listener"".
The turbulent tabloid years had seemingly erased people's memory of his abilities as a broadcaster - but once the show found its feet, Evans re-established himself as a warm, engaging presenter and was named music radio personality of the year at the Sony Radio Academy Awards.
At the time, he thanked the BBC for giving him ""a second chance"".
He kept a relatively low profile and mainly stayed out of the public eye, only making headlines in 2008 for his third marriage to professional golfer and model Natasha Shishmanian, and the birth of their son Noah in 2010.
Later that year it was announced Evans would be replacing national treasure Sir Terry Wogan on his Radio 2 breakfast show.
He has taken the programme from strength to strength. It is currently the UK's most popular morning show, with 9.5 million listeners tuning in every week, thanks to Evans' hard work and imagination.
One of his key innovations has been the 500 Words competition, a children's writing competition that, this year, secured the patronage of the Duchess of Cornwall.
Riding on the success of the Radio 2 show, he moved back to prime time television in 2010 by co-presenting The One Show on Friday evenings.
Earlier this month he also revived TFI Friday on Channel 4 for one night only - giving the show the final send off it never had, and attracting 4.2 million viewers in the process.
Evans' three-year deal with Top Gear will see him fronting one of the BBC's most successful commercial properties, watched by 350 million viewers worldwide and worth an estimated £50m a year.
Describing it as his ""favourite programme of all time"", Evans promised to ""do everything I possibly can to respect what has gone on before"".
When the new series begins, all eyes will be on the former motormouth to see if he can keep Clarkson's fans and drive the format forward to new audiences.","Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Tim Evans is set to be replaced by Jeremy Clarkson on Top Gear's new Saturday morning show, TFI Friday."

The Newry Reporter said that the court overturned planning approval on Monday.
The church was also awarded ""reasonable costs"" to cover its legal fees.
The screen had caused controversy when it was installed because of its close proximity to the cathedral.
Canon Francis Brown, from the cathedral, told the BBC that the church and parishioners were ""delighted"" with the court's decision.
""We had a number of issues with the screen,"" he said.
""For one, it was in front of the most historic building in the city. It was also distracting from Masses and services held in the cathedral.

He said the matter would now be ""re-determined by the council"" but that the church would oppose any move to keep the screen.

69310,"Daniel Kelley, from Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, pleaded guilty to hacking at the Old Bailey.
Judge Paul Worsley warned Kelley that, despite having no previous convictions, jail time was ""inevitable"" and that he should ""prepare"" himself.
Personal data belonging to nearly 157,000 customers was stolen from TalkTalk in October 2015.
Earlier, a 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named because of his age, was sentenced after a separate hearing at Norwich Youth Court.
Kelley admitted hacking into TalkTalk's systems to get customer data and also demanding a payment of 465 bitcoins.
That amount of the digital currency is currently worth £286,295.
He also pleaded guilty to further charges including blackmail and money laundering.
Kelley has been bailed until his sentencing, scheduled for 6 March 2017.
Email addresses and bank details were taken after the firm's website was breached, an incident that TalkTalk later said had cost it £42m.
A total of six people, all aged under 21, have been arrested as part of the police investigation into the matter.
Reacting to the prosecutions, a TalkTalk spokesman said: ""The Metropolitan Police and the CPS have worked hard to find those responsible for the cyber attack, and we are pleased that their investigations have led to two successful prosecutions.
""We hope that this outcome will encourage other companies to inform their customers and the police quickly when they are attacked.""
In October, the Information Commissioner's Office imposed a record fine of £400,000 on TalkTalk for poor website security.
Kelley's hacking offences involved TalkTalk and half a dozen other organisations.
One of those organisations included a Welsh further education college, Coleg Sir Gar, where Kelley was a student.
Targeting his college's website with a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack interfered with a local hospital nearby, the court heard.
This had the effect of delaying the return of medical files to doctors.

She left the BBC after fearing her voice was too posh. But now radio announcer Charlotte Green is to return to the corporation – to read the football scores. In a move that could upset some of the sport’s more traditionalist fans, the 57-year-old will replace the renowned James Alexander Gordon on Radio 5 Live’s Sports Report. She will become the first woman to read the classified football results, which are broadcast  at 5pm on Saturdays, when Gordon retires after 40 years on the programme. Some listeners expressed mixed feelings when the decision was announced yesterday. Writing on Twitter one fan said ‘Charlotte Green is a funny name for a bloke’ while another asked: ‘A woman? Reading the football?’ Others were more supportive and celebrated the appointment of a woman. One posted: ‘Charlotte Green will be reading the football results on the BBC. Pack up, feminists, the war has been won.’ Miss Green, who supports Tottenham Hotspur, read the news on Radio 4 before taking voluntary redundancy in January. After she left, she revealed she felt she was too posh for the channel, saying: ‘Received pronunciation, or accent-less accent, is on the wane. The BBC’s days of employing people who sound like me are more or less over.’ The veteran broadcaster will be the first woman to read the BBC Radio 5 Live football results . The presenter, who went on to be the . voice of a Classic FM programme called Charlotte Green’s Great . Composers, described her new post – revealed by Charles Sale in .

Maigstrates could move to end the ancient tradition of swearing on the Bible to tell the truth in court. Instead, witnesses and defendants would pledge not to lie without mentioning God – and could be jailed if they are caught out. Critics say the controversial plan would undermine Britain’s Christian heritage. Oath: Magistrates are considering scrapping the tradition of swearing on the Bible to tell the truth in court . The Magistrates’ Association, which represents 23,000 lay magistrates, will this month discuss concerns that many people do not take the oath seriously. If its policy committee approves the changes it will draft proposals to send to the Ministry of Justice. Ian Abrahams, 62, a Bristol magistrate who proposed scrapping the oath, said: ‘More and more I see people shrug their shoulders or say “whatever” when asked to take it. ‘I’m suggesting we take holy books out of the process. Instead, people will have to show they understand they could be sent to prison if they don’t tell the truth. 'I don’t intend my motion to make any comment on religion. It is certainly not anti-religious.’ There is already an option for non-believers to take a secular oath, while those of other faiths can swear on their own holy texts. But church leaders warned that the measure would be seen as eroding the country’s Christian foundations. The . Rt Rev Michael Nazir-Ali, former Bishop of Rochester, said: ‘This could . be the slippery slope towards the increasing secularisation of society. Where will it end – with the Coronation Oath? ‘The . Bible is bound up with the constitution, institutions and history of . this country. It is right for people to have a choice of oath, a . religious or non-religious one. ‘But we are being urged, in the name of tolerance and secularisation, to restrict that choice.’ Significant: The Rt Rev Michael Nazir-Ali, a former Bishop of Rochester, said the Bible is bound up with the institutions of Britain . The . Rev Arun Arora, director of communications for the Church of England, . added: ‘Given that the last census showed almost 60 per cent of . respondents self-identified as Christians and two thirds as people of . faith, this proposal seems to ignore the statistical reality that we . remain a faithful nation. ‘This kind of proposal seems driven more by blinkered campaigning agendas than abiding interests in justice and truth.’ John Glen, Tory MP for Salisbury and a magistrate until last year, said: ‘This smacks of political correctness gone mad.’ Legal expert Lord Carlile said: ‘It would be unacceptable for the choice to take a religious oath to be removed.’ For . hundreds of years Christian witnesses have been required to hold the . Bible and state: ‘I swear by almighty God that I shall tell the truth, . the whole truth and nothing but the truth.’ Followers . of other faiths are given copies of their sacred texts with, for . example, Muslims swearing on the Koran and Jews on the Old Testament. Under . Mr Abrahams’ proposal, the holy books would be removed and the oath . would read: ‘I promise very sincerely to tell the truth, the whole truth . and nothing but the truth and I understand that if I fail to do so I . will be committing an offence for which I will be punished and may be . sent to prison.’ A Ministry . of Justice spokesman said: ‘We have no plans to change the arrangements . for swearing an oath or making an affirmation in court, which have . worked well for many years and still do.’",Magistrates are considering scrapping the ancient tradition of swearing on the Bible.
