As an aside, the _BBC Radio Times_ magazine's coverline reads in full:               ```Gambacini charged.```

[Edited to add --] The full article is available online.

The BBC is currently hosting a ""listen again"" for ""The Paul Gambacini Show"" on _BBC Five Live Radio_ and at the end of yesterday's show -- at 8.40 am this morning -- there is a brief conversation with the DJ -- in which he admits to the police that he has abused alcohol and drugs but states that he has not abused children.

As to the ""BBC Radio Times"", I've just spotted it on the BBC website. It is free, after a four-page advertisement. (Well, okay, you pay for your subscription -- but the ads are free).

On the other hand, for those who wish to save the trouble of buying a magazine, why not go to:

14283,1,"Paul Gambaccini has spoken of his feeling'shattered' after being told the
authorities would not be taking any new action against him despite his
allegations against an alleged sex predator. Scotland Yard launched
operation Yewtree after claims were made of historical child sex abuse
against high-profile stars including late BBC TV presenter Jimmy
Savile. The 65-year-old DJ was arrested in October last year in a
police raid linked to allegations that he had sexually assaulted two
minors with a view to prostitution when he was 28. At the same time,
the investigation was looking at allegations of sex offences against
Savile, who died a year ago, and other men. The CPS confirmed on
Thursday afternoon that there was ‘insufficient evidence’ to take the
charges to court. He admitted having sex with two minors while he was in
Bolivia (then Argentina), but insisted both of the boys were over 18.
He has repeatedly strenuously denied he molested them for money. Mr
Gambaccini was released on bail and spent almost a year in custody before
the decision. In a statement issued today, he said: ‘Since I was

Paul Gambaccini is a well known DJ and television presenter, who has worked at the BBC Radio 2 since 1973 working mainly on the breakfast show. Last year in November, he was arrested by the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree in connection with historical sexual abuse.
After nearly a year the Crown Prosecution Service today confirmed that they will not be taking further action against the openly gay host.
The Met Police said he was in ``active police custody and was co-operating fully with the investigation''.
Mr Gambaccini is thought to still be working at the BBC.
Paul Gambaccini was arrested in November by detectives from Operation Yewtree, which is investigating historic sex abuse.
The 65-year-old DJ was bailed soon after his arrest but was detained again last month on an outstanding warrant.
Operation Yewtree is investigating historic sexual abuse across a range of industries, including showbusiness.
Police have so far arrested 30 people but none have been charged.
The BBC is yet to issue any statement on the incident.
Mr Gambaccini is accused of two counts of sexually assaulting two teenagers at a flat in Lambeth, south"

In a series called 'Undercats', the Swiss photographer merged 15 owners with their favourite felines. In this transformation, cat Salem, pictured left, is merged with his owner Mariette - both donning the same helmet. The 28-year-old used expert photo-manipulation techniques to seamlessly transplant the feline faces onto the human bodies. Here, cat Figaro is spliced with young cap-wearing owner Elia, who is pictured right. Using his friends, family and strangers, the 28-year-old - who says he is fascinated with cats' eyes - cleverly photographed owners and their respective pets in the same portrait style. He then used expert photo-manipulation techniques on the computer to seamlessly transplant the feline faces onto the human bodies. Highlights of the series, which is called Undercats, include a lady called Daniela's hair blending perfectly with the face of her ginger cat, Micky. There's even a photo of the photographer's father, Ermano, with the face of his cat, Jag, wearing a"

A big, wide world is at our fingertips but sometimes we turn to our closest relations to explain the things we're going to leave behind. This series has no end; it's just beginning. Each picture could be another story of a close relationship between people and their pets. The whole series is based on the word ""undercats"", because the images are of an uncanny similarity. We see them on a daily basis, and a lot of things are the same: the poses, the expressions and the eyes. This is a project that has no end; each picture could be another story of a close relationship between people and their pets. There were times when I could have used the same camera but I changed the colors of the face to make a more personal interpretation. This is a project that comes from a place of curiosity and love. We all have a common link with our animal friends. What's so special about this series is that it focuses on the relationship between people and their pets and explores the human-animal relationship.

45657,1,"The Lib Dems announced what party sources have described as a commitment to scrap the ""jobs tax on young workers"", should they be elected to government.
Party sources have described proposals to scrap the jobs tax, introduced by the SNP, as an ""election commitment"" and have said if introduced it would be similar to plans to raise the personal allowance to Â£12,500 while stopping the tax-free allowance for higher rate income tax payers.
The party says introducing the tax would save young people an average of Â£900 a year while costing the government around Â£50m a year in tax revenues.
The party said its plans to introduce a tax amnesty for foreign owned companies who had paid tax in the UK would cost some Â£30m a year if companies paid the tax back.
Speaking about the party's plans for Wales, party Secretary General Lord Ashdown told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""One of the things we have to do first is to address the fact of unfairness that's going on between Wales and England, I don't know why it's happening but we have got to get to the bottom of it, because a number of areas in Wales look like a different economy to England""

It has pledged to invest a further Â£5.3bn more in education and training while bringing Welsh school standards up to at least the ÂB-mark by 2015.
Plaid Cymru has also pledged a Â£2bn increase in training to match Welsh school standards.

It is the third time this year that the Mashco Piro people have been seen.
Anthropologists say they were probably looking for tools or food. However, it is not known why the Mashco Piro attacked.
The group is estimated to number around 600 and they live in separated groups, constantly moving through the forest.
They occasionally make makeshift shelters along river banks and dig for turtle eggs.
Peru's government has forbidden physical contact with them and another dozen or so ""uncontacted"" indigenous tribes because they have little immunity or resistance to illnesses that other humans carry.
Anthropologists say that in the area of jungle where they have been seen, near the Madre de Dios river in southern Peru, some locals have been trying to tempting the Mashco Piro out of the forest with rewards, pitying what is seen as a primitive existence.
Peru's government has been financing a group of indigenous specialists for some time in the area to deal with contacts between settled communities and isolated tribes.

As soon as the shooting ceased, some in the community of Shipetiari, a small village in the southern part of Peru, tried to save him. They dug under his bleeding body for hours hoping he would still be alive but eventually gave up and accepted he was dead. It was not immediately clear who fired the deadly arrow.
The attack was the latest in a series of confrontations between the isolated Mashco Piro and locals. It was not clear what triggered the invasion of the Shipetiari village at the end of last week but the group have attacked other places in the area.
This year, the Mashco Piro have been seen in different parts of the jungle and at least 14 encounters have been recorded.
They are said to live in small groups along river banks and dug up turtle eggs. The group which invaded the Shipetiari village, for example, may have been trying to recover the tools they left there during an escape.

Since it is clear that this tribe or group is not indigenous to the area which surrounds the village of Shipetiari in the region of Madre de Dios in Peru, the village had its own difficulties with contact.
A similar difficulty which has happened before and which continues to happen is that people approach these isolated people with all kinds of gifts, such as blankets, clothing, money, alcohol or food, and this has led to tragic incidents for the members of these groups and for the isolated people as well as for non-indigenous members of settled community.
As with many other tribes or communities in the Amazon rainforest, these isolated people suffer greatly from hunger, but what is more serious is that it is no longer uncommon for people to take these poor people as slaves.

   Britons are `pre-toxing' in the run-up to Christmas
  by Sarah Marsh

  The trend to ‘get in shape’ began in the 1990s as a response to the pressure of living in a post-Cold War society. By the turn of this millennium, it had taken off for its own sake. What began as an attempt at trimming the body became a lifestyle, with a healthy diet, more exercise and some light weight-training becoming an important part of the picture.

  This lifestyle change comes with the promise of rewards, but while most people can do it relatively easily, many of us will struggle to change from this way of life back to our normal, less committed one. According to Professor Keith Willett at the Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences at the University of Leeds, ‘most people can benefit from losing weight’. This comes with a caveat, however — ‘unless"

A new report from Currys PC World demonstrates the growing popularity of wearable technology amongst British employees, with a 20% increase in sales and 27% increase over the week ending 6 December.  Men are more likely than women to make use of wearables for fitness purposes, with 41% of women and 24% of men using them to lose weight.  The survey also found that men take their pre-Christmas slimming down more seriously than women, with men only thinking about slimming down for Christmas towards the end of November, two weeks after women.  The study found that 80% of the UK population put weight on during the Christmas period.  This is likely because of the indulgence on offer and the lack of exercise routine to counter it.  Fitness is a growing trend in the office environment with many organisations embracing the health and lifestyle benefits of exercise.

My dad, for the most part, had kept pretty much a straight edge since he was 18, his mother had killed herself drinking. And I didn't expect my dad to die, I thought for him to die is only in the movies, you know,"

This is very cool.
There's a little tidbit of info on how it works in the opening paragraph:
""Although the bridge was originally designed to be an underwater cable-stayed bridge, a lack of geological study, and a lack of accurate survey data on the rock under the riverbed, caused construction to focus more on the land side. This allowed for a very efficient and safe construction method, but was a huge engineering challenge. As this was never tested on land (except for a small section in the middle of the bridge), a significant amount of experimentation and construction design had to be made to make sure the construction method transferred over.

That's a very technical and interesting article that's pretty good at conveying some concepts that I've been curious about for quite a while. Thanks for sharing, OP!
Some of the more mundane details are in the ""Sources"" section:

* China's Yunnan province to build world's highest bridge** Highest bridge to cross two mountains (Beipanjiang) will open next year

The two mountainous districts of Beipanjiang and Wuli were separated by a river a few decades ago, but in the last few years they have started to come together thanks to the building of new transportation links. Now, the Yunnan government has announced that the world's highest bridge will open next year.

Beipanjiang bridge

The Beipanjiang bridge stands 565 metres above the ground, which is nearly twice the height of the Shard skyscraper in London. It links the two mountainous areas of Yunnan and Guizhou, cutting the journey time from four hours to around one hour.

The four lane bridge, which spans 1,341 metres, is now open to vehicles.

The US$15 billion bridge is said to improve the transport network between the two provinces.

According to the Kunming government, the government's engineering division will work with the construction of an airport and an expressway to meet the demands of the large number of visitors travelling from Kunming to the area.

64516,3,"It’s not exactly the Matterhorn, but a bridge in China’s southern Yunnan Province has set a new world record for the highest suspension bridge.

The bridge, inaugurated on December 22, connects an area in northwestern Yunnan and another in southern Guizhou Province, cutting travel time between the two mountainous areas from 16 hours to just one hour, CNNreported. While the new bridge is the tallest in China, the world record for the highest suspension bridge is now held by the Dhaulagiri Scissors in India and Nepal, which spans 714 metres.

The bridge stands 565 metres above the ground, which is nearly twice the height of London’s second tallest skyscraper, the Shard.The engineering feat required over 3.3 metres of steel cables to suspend the bridge over a river and an area of 3,380 acres, according to state media.

The new bridge was designed by China's Academy of Engineering, an agency that specializes in bridge engineering. Its design, which included a cable system built for the world-record attempt, is said to meet the country’s demands for high-quality construction.

CNN reports the cables were cut and the bridge came down just five days"

But what does this shocking revelation tell us about Russia? Does it mean that Russia’s President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in the planning of the New York attack?

Or was Putin simply aware of the attacks as was the case before the attack? Or could it be that the US military have a better idea about what actually happened on 9/11 than the public has been told, especially about those mysterious “e-mails” which appeared in the wake of the attack?

The US military report on the alleged Russian spies and their cover stories for what they were doing in America on the day of the 9/11 attacks confirms that at least 12 Russian intelligence officers were in and around the Pentagon at the time of the attacks.

  Liverpool Crown Court heard that nine men convicted of child sex offences had exploited their vulnerable victims through an ""unprecedented"" conspiracy to commit rape, supplying the girls with drink and ""passing them around"" for sex.
The men were convicted of charges including conspiracy to rape and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a child during a weeklong trial, which ended on Wednesday.

  Judge Mr Justice Royce said it was ""a matter of great concern"" that men in their 20s were raping girls as young as 13.
''We had a massive conspiracy of rape, a huge case of rape, and some sadistic behaviour that was almost inhuman,"" he said. ""It was a large group of men who had a systematic and concerted plan to get drunk and then to have 'rape-fests' for which they would then pay. They would then go with those girls and rape the girls so they could have those nights out.''
''These young girls were basically passed around,"" the judge said. ""The girls have been effectively used as victims for their own entertainment and the enjoyment of those men.""

According-  to a ""testimony"" given to the Vatican court by Father Carlo Alberto Capella last week, Mr. Gabriele is being persecuted by the Pope's enemies, but I will present you with the rest of the story.

Mr. Paolo Gabriele was the Pope's butler.  As such, he had a privileged relationship with the Holy Father, with the two of them spending many hours together, and of course not the least, during meals.

According to Father Capella, Mr. Gabriele was entrusted by the Pope with sensitive, secret, and confidential documents, documents upon which the Catholic Church's entire doctrine and doctrine- based legal system depends.  This man has committed all sorts of crimes and has stolen, and still has, so many documents, some of which have already made their way into the Italian press.  Mr. Gabriele has made claims publicly that these documents prove the Pope to be a murderer, a liar, a thief, and other vile things.

The charges were aggravated, the prosecutor said, because Gabriele would have to share a cell with another inmate serving a longer sentence for murder.

Prosecutors are investigating whether Gabriele may have given sensitive Vatican documents in recent years to two journalists, Eugenio Scalfari and Paolo Cascini, who wrote a book about him."

The former butler was found guilty on Monday of theft, aggravated fraud and violating the secrecy of the church.

More significantly, Dortmund's defence is in tatters: shapeless, error prone and lacking in confidence. At the moment, Klopp's side panic whenever they endure a set back. The fear of defeat appears to weigh over them."

  <B>Bayern Munich</B> have not lost a single Bundesliga game since October 23, 2013 -- a 17-game unbeaten run. They are the highest-scoring team in the Bundesliga, and the German and European Champions. In the 2013 Champions League Final, they were beaten 2-1 in a pulsating game by Spanish giants Real Madrid. German international and Dortmund youth product Mario Gotze suffered a heartbreak, and has spent the last season in limbo -- unable to establish himself at the club. Nevertheless, the 24-year-old is one of the best players in the world. With Robben, Ribery and Mueller in attack, Gotze and Kingsley Coman in midfield, Bayern possess an abundance of attacking talent. Their opponents, on the opposite hand, possess only a few players of similar calibre. Mario Gotze endured a difficult 12 months. This season is promising"

Dortmund are winless in their previous three matches, losing twice and drawing once in that stretch of games. This is not a good run for a side that has taken over a decade of dominance in the top flight of German football and are chasing a UEFA Champions league title and German Super cup. The last time the two collided in this fixture, Dortmund were victorious with a 2-1 win to take them to the lead in the Bundesliga title race. However, they lost the next match to Eintracht Frankfurt and allowed Bayern Munich to sneak in and take over the first spot. Bayern Munich also failed to close the gap when they hosted their arch-rivals Eintracht Frankfurt to a 1-1 draw. The last time the two met Bayern Munich beat Dortmund 2-1 to take them to the lead in the Bundesliga title race. The match will again go down in the history of German football as it will set the tone of the season for both sides. It will be an exciting match and one for the ages to be remembered as one of the greatest matches ever played in Germany. Where:"

As a result of the ensuing struggle, two of the gunmen were killed: 41-year-old Michael Bassal of Brentwood, Tennessee, and 34-year-old Jeff Bassal of Franklin, Tennessee. The third assailant, Wayne Williams of Maury County, was wounded and captured by police who had arrived on the scene. Williams himself was wounded after he surrendered to police.

According to court documents, the men arrived at the property seeking a refund because the work the men had contracted to a local sign-making firm had not been completed.

According to investigators, Peter Williams was charged with being a felon in possession of a weapon after being found with a.25-caliber pistol at his home. The indictment was returned Thursday.

Williams appeared in court on Tuesday, July 8, to face the charge of concealment of a serious indictable offense, which was brought against him in connection with the incident. He pleaded not guilty."

This is really the biggest rip off of disabled people I can remember.
I think the insurance industry got wind of how much they can charge for the premiums. This is a very good study.
I think they should start with people who have died and not look at what they pay after.
I know some disabled people who don't have a penny to spare, so it is criminal to charge people who have not got a choice but not to charge people who do get a choice.

Mr Hindle Fisher is chairman of the Extra Costs Commission, launched by the charity Scope.
The commission will look at the costs faced by disabled people ranging from a higher transport bill to the price of specialist equipment.
Scope claims that this living costs premium facing disabled people amounts to Â£550 a month. This, it claims, is not covered by the typical total of Â£360 a month available to people through the main benefits to which they are entitled.

In today's article I will bring to you the proof of Google Earth being used by the FBI to hunt for the terrorists, and it is easy to prove. You can use a simple Google Toolbar to do the task. If you find a suspicious place or place that has a lot of houses in them with suspicious activities, you will be able to find it all with just one click. It is not an easy task and you'll need a lot of patience, but it will be worth it. I will also share with you the proof of Google Earth's use in finding a man with missing fingers. There are a lot of people saying that the pictures are fake, but if you use this tool, you will see that it doesn't really look fake. It is real. You have nothing to lose but your time.

76846,3,"An alleged image of a weird man looking around a Plymouth house as a horrified woman used her mobile phone - and the fact the intruder photographed himself as he sat in her living room - sent a shiver through the city.

Suspicions were aroused that a man had been hiding in a house on Bursk Road, close to the Old Saltdean Road, for the past five weeks – creeping around the property at night, checking the windows looking in, and in the same week peering in through a living room window while a woman showered.

While the woman had no idea who the man was, she had taken an image from her mobile phone of a stranger looking at her through her living room window, which she later showed to family.

The full image shows the lounge of the house, with the furniture arranged in a neat manner, and shows a shadow in the room and what, according to a source, is what looks like someone sitting down at a table in front of a mirror.

The source said: “She was looking in the mirror and saw the man – and looked again and found he was actually in the house.

To be frank I think this entire Ukraine/Russia situation is pretty sketchy. It may be the next hot war, maybe not.
I hope it not and that it's just an excuse to go around the world arming themselves with weapons and killing each other.

It's a pretty simple calculus: Russia is a huge, resource rich country. If their economy were to suffer so did the EU's. This would cripple the EU's ability to do any effective economic interference inside of Russia in the future.
So, let's say Russia suffers a series of embargoes that don't quite destroy their economy but does create a major recession, say in the next couple of years. When that happens Putin's base will be split and he'll turn the country's attention away from the West and towards the USA.

1. In an attempt to reduce petrol prices, the previous Government launched a plan to increase competition in the fuel market.  During the policy period, petrol prices were reduced almost by half.  This was due to both the Competition Act 2000, which allowed more competitors to enter the market, and the competition and markets authority, which enforced the new laws.  In order to help the Government achieve this, the Competition Bill was brought back to Parliament in the last session.  Some proposals were introduced (the minimum price, the maximum hours and the maximum driving distance), but the bill was watered down to simply allow the minimum price to take effect.  This watered down version of the bill was used as a starting point for the latest round of market-opening proposals in the forthcoming competition bill.

2. The Government is now trying to reduce fuel prices once again. This time they propose to allow independent filling stations to bid for contracts with the supermarket chain Asda, allowing fuel to be supplied directly to their forecourts rather than over distribution chains.  To cut out the middleman, the companies would be required to deliver the fuel themselves rather than have a pipeline from the distribution company.

The Nelson Mandela Foundation (the Mandela Foundation) has launched an investigation into a painting that has been likened to apartheid-era racist propaganda.

A painting by Brett Murray which has been described as showing Nelson Mandela's penis will be held until September while the Nelson Mandela Foundation investigates if it is racist, homophobic or racist to the LGBT community.

The painting, called 'Bend Over', depicts the former president holding up his backside.

Mr Mandela has taken offence at the painting which shows him wearing the beret of Soweto uprising activist, Steve Biko, while bending over to pick something up. Biko died after an enforced medical evacuation to a psychiatric hospital in 1978.

It also features a man in a brown beret - similar in style to the one the former president wore during his time in prison.

Both Mr Mandela and the Nelson Mandela Foundation have now filed urgent court papers forcing the gallery to stop sales of the painting.

The matter was set to be heard at the High Court on Monday.

Is that right?

Yes there isn't an exemption for using performance enhancing drugs while competing.

That is what the article said, but it does not clarify how they are being punished.
The article says that you cannot _only_ use the substance. Does that refer to using it during the competition, or within the 90 day break between events?
_Edit: Apparently this is a drug to treat ADHD which is prescribed to the
competitor. While it is being prescribed, he is not breaking the rules..
It is a grey area, because without the ADHD, he would not have had a competitive advantage, but as it is approved for that use, it probably is also OK to use during the competition.. I.e. as long as you use it during the competition, and not more than 48 hours beforehand, or more than 6 days afterwards it should be fine._

I'm not sure what's going on here, but it still sounds a horrible idea to me. If ESL want to do the right thing, then there should be no dispensations.

The incident was immediately investigated, and a group was set up to deal with the issue: the Bias Incident Response Team. The team, whose task was to investigate ""any and all instances of bias, harassment, discrimination, and intimidation on our campus,"" promptly reported the findings of its investigation to the college's president, Philip R. Hanlon. What the team did not know, but would quickly learn, was that the group in effect behind the incident, the Bias Incident Response Team, had been staging incidents of bias and harassment itself—and making them look as though they had been written by racist or homophobic bigots from outside the Vassar community. After learning this, the school released a press release on November 8 stating that it would be convening all students for a two-day town-hall meeting to confront the alleged bias incidents. But"

The government should create a fund that could be loaned to individuals to cover their outstanding rent or mortgage. In exchange, they agree to buy the house.
They would have to buy from the same area that they rented, so there would still be pressure on the market to move people in. There would be less demand on resources in the rental market, since the government would effectively replace the landlord.
I think if anyone is owed rent or a mortgage, they should be given one of these grants.

The problem of a housing market that cannot keep up with demand is not unique to the US.
It is a problem that has existed on various world-scales for over a century.
It has been identified by economists by now that the housing market works at a ratio of 25 to 1 or more, meaning in order to create 1 unit of affordable housing you must remove 25 units from the market.

SIR: The disposal of household waste from Birmingham is a serious problem. In recent times we have seen a number of large scale fly-tipping episodes involving substantial numbers of household waste items.
To put this in perspective, Birmingham has two official fly-tipping sites. One, operated by the council, on Sutton Road Industrial Estate, Birmingham, has recently seen a large increase in volumes and the need for heavy machinery to load and unload, with the implication that the waste is being dumped rather than burnt (this could be due in part to higher prices for waste disposal). The second site, a private site operated by a waste haulage group, has recently seen large numbers of fly-tipping episodes which has led to a court case against a private driver of the articulated vehicle used to dump the waste.
The local authority is now looking very carefully at the need for and the efficacy of a Public Works Department, to replace or supplement our existing contract with Waste Solutions, who have also recently been accused by a number of residents of operating an unscrupulous collection system.
It has been reported widely that the government is likely to review the waste collection contract with local authorities on the basis that the current contract is not delivering. The government has stated that"

UK driver arrested in fatal crash which killed woman on M25

The driver of a car which struck and killed a woman walking along the M25 has been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving and failing to stop.

Police said the collision on the motorway close to the junction to Slough, Berkshire, happened at 2.50am this morning.

The injured woman, believed to be in her thirties, was pronounced dead by paramedics in Chertsey after being hit by a black Volkswagen Golf which failed to stop at the scene.

The driver was arrested further down the M25 and will be interviewed by officers later today.

Surrey Police said it was not clear at this point why she was walking along the motorway.

The M25 was closed to traffic anti-clockwise from junction 14 to junction 12 for nine hours.

It then reopened between junction 14 and 11. It remains closed between junctions 11 and 12.

A Highways Agency spokeswoman said the woman was hit near slip road 13 northbound.

She added that the incident ""hasn't caused much disruption"".

Surrey Police said the driver was arrested after failing a breath test."

    Marvin Gaye was a man in constant conflict, who wrote some of the most powerful songs in recent decades, only to see his life ruined by his own ego and selfishness. His sister, Anna Gordy Gaye, was his moral compass that kept him on the straight and narrow. He called her his angel of reason. He sang her praises in his best songs, and she was so devoted to him, that she was willing to die for him. This makes her one of the most important and influential people in the history of rock and roll. She not only taught Marvin how to be a writer-musician and singer, but influenced and inspired many of the greatest musicians in the world, including Prince.
    Anna was born in 1922. When she was young, she fell in love with music and sang backup for her brother Marvin on his radio show. She was only fourteen at the time. By 1941, she had written several hit songs for her brother.
    In 1958, at the point that Marvin’s career seemed to be taking off, the Gayes’ personal lives reached a breaking point. The marriage of Marvin and Anna was already on the rocks, and the couple"

on revenues of 15.16 billion euros.''

What seems strange to me is why Nokia is talking about the profit of the Nokia Siemens business so much, given its losses there in 2011 and 2012 were ~2.5b on revenues of ~8.5b.

So is this Nokia turning out to be a typical tech company that gets stuck in a never-ending cycle of losses?

I thought Nokia's first quarter of loss wasn't all that impressive considering how big the market was for mobile devices and their low relative market-share.

With the upcoming windows 8 on smartphones, and WP8 on phablets/tablets, it's not surprising to see their business suffering.
This was a long forecast, it's not just this quarter.

If that were the case Nokia would've posted a loss in most of WP phone's history.

Not really. Windows phone started selling in September, Q3 is the second quarter of WP's life, and Nokia is only selling WP7 phones right now. Last quarter was the first quarter that Nokia lost money on Windows phones.

If they had started selling the next year, it would have happened"

This is a case which involves justice and oppression, and will probably be an American issue for a long time. If Louis Head speaks out as he reportedly did, then the case may become more clear, as well as other cases which have been mentioned. And if Louis has been silenced, then there remains a shadow which shows the issue of oppression as prevalent as it is in the US.
     This is a case which will attract much attention, as the trial of Michael Brown begins this week, now that the evidence has been gathered."

The incident caused widespread protests and unrest across the US and fuelled a larger national debate about policing and race.
The grand jury decision announced on Tuesday came three months before police officer Darren Wilson is due to stand trial in the state of Missouri for murder.
The killing of Brown, an 18-year-old from the nearby town of Ferguson, Missouri, sparked national outrage and protests across the US.
''I got a grand jury, so my family and I have been thinking of ways to keep our head up,"" Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr, told Al Jazeera.
""The family was not disappointed. There are more people of faith that saw justice was done than those that did not.""
A rally in support of Brown's family was planned for 10:00 pm (03:00 GMT, Wednesday) near the courthouse where a grand jury was convening to decide whether the policeman should face charges.

Fukushima - Japanese authorities say nuclear crisis from plant accident is fading and evacuation order lifted

FUKUSHIMA, JAPAN (REUTERS) - Japanese evacuation orders were lifted all around the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant on Sunday (Jan 15), a government spokesman said, allowing some residents to return home a day after Tokyo Electric Power Co Inc (TEPCO) said the power crisis had eased.
A resident of Minamisoma, about 17km north of the plant about a week after a massive earthquake and tsunami triggered a nuclear meltdown there, was the first to return home, a Reuters witness said.
Tens of thousands of evacuees who have been unable to find safe housing in a country struggling to cope with its worst natural disaster in decades are still in shelters across the country.

In almost all situations, the best way to get rid of a problem is to replace it with something else and this can be done by switching control between the player and the machine. There are two obvious solutions. Switching control to the machine will work if, for example, the car is a lawn mower that doesn’t work. Switching control to the player will work if, for example, the car is at the garage which means you might as well walk.

They showed ""extraordinary"" differences between cancerous cells and say new targeted drugs may fail as they may be unable to kill all the mutated tissue.
Experts said the findings would have ""profound implications"" for treatments.
A tumour starts as a single cell, which acquires mutations and eventually divides uncontrollably. But that is not the end of the process.
Cancerous cells continue to mutate and become more aggressive, move round the body and resist drugs.
This process is chaotic and results in a ""diverse"" tumour containing cancerous cells that have mutated in different ways.
""This has huge implications for medicine,"" researcher Prof Mel Greaves told the BBC.
His team at the Institute of Cancer Research investigated cancer diversity in five children with leukaemia. They compared mutations in individual cancerous cells with a known database of mutations.
Their results, published in the journal Genome Research, showed patients had between two and 10 genetically distinct leukaemias.

The incident occurred near Quneitra, during heavy fighting between Syrian rebels and government forces. Rebels captured and arrested 43 Fijian peacekeepers in the area. One of those captured is a commander of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (Undof).

They also kidnapped three Americans, a Philippine solider, and a Jordanian soldier. Their captors demand that they return to their unit.

Here`s a brief introduction to each one, as a free gift for subscribers: Leicester`s bad form continues Leicester have been knocked down from second and are now seventh after only a single win in three games, leaving their hopes of reaching next summer's Champions League via the play-offs on a knife-edge.

91940,1,Rudd calls for talks on work permits for EU migrants as she rejects points-based system
91940,2,"Home Secretary Amber Rudd has said that the UK has not ruled out introducing a system allowing businesses to pay for the right to bring workers to Britain after Brexit.
The admission, made to Sky news' Sophy Ridge on Sunday, appeared to suggest a relaxation of the Home Office's stance on immigration controls during the talks on the transition period.
Mrs Rudd was asked about the idea, which has been championed by a number of Tory MPs, including former UK ambassador to the US Sir Craig Oliver.
She replied: ""Of course some of the ideas that people have come up with certainly have value.
""The one that I think is a given is that many people voted to reduce immigration.
""We respect that, we can't just turn a complete blind eye to it because it is important.""
She added: ""There isn't a policy at the moment in the EU that allows migration, and if you look at the negotiations, that comes up again and again.""
Ms Rudd also reiterated the government's view that it was not looking at a points-based system to control EU migration championed by Brexit campaigners in the build-up to the referendum, saying it ""simply doesn't work.""
She said her department was considering the alternative of requiring EU"
91940,3,"Summary: Home Secretary `reluctant to rule out points system
`Home Secretary `not ruling out points system; `we are looking at it'
`We do not rule anything out; `nothing is off the table'
`In principle, we are open to discussion with anyone'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm a bit confused.
Does the work permit system require any skills? Is it a point based system or a points plus some other requirement? And are there any restrictions related to nationality?
I'm not saying we shouldn't have a points based system (or an accession based system, or both, or none, etc...); I'm saying we should know what we are getting into.

I think it's just a point based system. I have no information one way or the other on nationality restrictions."
91940,4,"The UK's proposed “points-based immigration system” would mean EU nationals who want to come to the UK will need to earn at least 60 points before being allowed to come.'' ```

This is very much not an attempt to limit immigration from the EU, but rather a move to limit immigration by all other people.
This is exactly what we had feared was the outcome of Brexit, and we warned about the impact of the Leave campaign lying to us about the issues.
How long have we known that this would be the result?

What we need is a 'Free Movement for All' solution, whereby immigration and trade between the UK and the EU is just like between Canada and the EU. All people should have the right to relocate, so long as they have sufficient skills to work in the UK.
It is the least free- movement can be and it is the most protection for the EU immigrants that the UK population can provide.

Yes, I agree with your solution, or at least its premises. My concern is that it is simply not possible to offer this unless the British public is willing to accept freedom of movement for EU citizens.
Freedom of movement is why Cameron negotiated this deal in the first place. It was offered"

Here are three major issues.
Who (and where) is involved?
The company has had over 20 allegations of sexual harassment made against it since 1994, according to an analysis reported by the New York Times. But the biggest charge has come this year, and is against Rupert Murdoch. A female reporter in New York has said that a year ago Mr Murdoch, and his son James, tried to force her to move her story, after she reported him of sexual harassment.
The case involves 21st Century Fox News, the Fox channel and Fox News Radio. The woman is Laurie Luhn, a former journalist for Fox.
She has received an $11 million settlement, she told the New Yorker. But Fox denied those claims. Her allegations are now being investigated by state criminal prosecutors in New York. This would be one of the most senior cases involving a media boss and a reporter to hit American public life recently.

British PM Cameron: ~~Assad sarin use a “war crime” The London Telegraph

by David Williams and Tim Shipman

18:37 EST, 26 April 2013 UK

 US secretary of state Kerry says “serious, credible” evidence proves use of chemical weapons by Assad.

WASHINGTON — Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday that there is now “serious and credible evidence” that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons on a small scale in its bloody civil war, and vowed to investigate the claims and punish those proven responsible.

“When those responsible for the attack are identified and located then there will be consequences,” he said. ""These are serious allegations and we are now assessing that evidence.""

Mr Kerry was speaking one day after President Barack Obama laid out a case for military action in Syria and said the United States would “pivot” its military focus in the region, stepping up efforts to combat al-Qaeda militants in Syria. A senior US official said that if the US and its allies chose to"
59206,1,"The US is planning yet another military intervention in Syria. The president is preparing to send up to 300 special operations forces to Syria for a month to carry out military raids inside the country.

In a press conference, Obama said he wanted to “avoid a situation where people get killed in a way that is not necessary”.

He also said that “I think it is very important for politicians and leaders of this generation to look at what is happening in Syria and ask ourselves what more we can do”.

That is code for military intervention by the West, with NATO forces on the ground.

President Obama’s intention to establish US military boots on the ground in Syria is just one more step towards “regime change”.

The US has a long history of destabilising other nations for the benefit of the military-industrial complex.

The US and Britain have overthrown the governments of Iran, Chile and Guatemala just in the last forty years alone.

Obama has already been involved in the arming, training and financing of the Syrian army.

However, this is not being carried out in the capacity of “defending Syrian citizens”.

“It’s not a rescue mission, but because people are concerned for the lady’s safety.”

Sandy was last seen at around 10am on Thursday, wearing green trousers, a green jacket and a yellow jumper.

It's been dubbed 'the summer of fear' because of the surge in pressure on hospital emergency departments this year following a series of severe floods that have left hospital buildings and equipment needing major repair.
But the extra funding that came into effect at the start of this year is proving to have little effect and the doctors' union calls the situation in emergency departments 'completely predictable'.

The NHS will be overwhelmed by demand for emergency care in the run-up to Christmas, as health chiefs admit that the NHS Emergency Department (ED) services for both emergency and day patients have become overcrowded, with some units more than 200 per cent full.

So overcrowded, that some emergency departments have been forced to cancel planned surgeries in order to deal with an influx of patients.

The figures are released today (Monday 18 December 2017) as part of NHS England’s three-week festive winter flu vaccination campaign.

This comes as a Royal College of Nurses study has found that staffing in hospital emergency departments has been cut by 7,600 posts since 2004.

And NHS England figures have found that people are arriving at hospital emergency departments up to 13 times a year inpatient.

To deal with the influx of patients, NHS England has been given £13million to fund extra doctors and nursing staff at nine hospitals, who will work through the Christmas, New Year and February half term periods.

The main impact on crime and alcohol harm from minimum pricing will come from those less able to afford it, where, by definition, that group also has greater rates of harm related to alcohol. It is simply not going to impact on the harms that the most harmful drinkers are consuming. The reason behind this decision and the fact that it was done without proper consultation seems to highlight some problems within government thinking when it comes to alcohol. The government is also not willing to consider the impact that its decision will have on small businesses in this area. It seems there are other things this government wants to achieve without considering the impact on the individual or the economy in general. This government has set the bar rather high.''``  By.

The Government's pledge on Monday to save 4,000 lives by next year could be undermined.

Supermarket and convenience stores are already selling some high-strength lager and cider at less than a bottle of water.

Two major supermarkets, Wm Morrison Supermarkets and Poundstretcher, confirmed that they have already begun to sell cheap pints of bitter for 35p and 4.5 per cent cider for 59p - although they have not committed to lowering prices by law.

An analysis by The Daily Telegraph of the first week following the ban found that one store on the seafront in Blackpool was selling high-strength bottles of 7.5 per cent cider for 89p while a plastic bottle of water was priced at 99p.

Buy Low Bargains, close to the pier, sells Omega Cider for 89p. Its manager Sam Meak described its customers as 'alcoholics so they don't mind if they buy it cheap or whatever, they would buy the cider if it was £20'.

The Scottish Parliament has passed a bill banning the sale of cheap alcohol to children, after the Government's pledge to introduce minimum pricing for beer, wine and spirits.

Under the law, introduced by Green MSP Patrick Harvie, only beer, wine and spirits sold in supermarkets may be bought by people under 19 or on behalf of a minor.

It would also ban supermarkets from selling alcohol above 50p a unit, although those found breaking the law would face a fine.

The minimum price will rise when the law is due to come into effect in 2017, and will continue to rise until it reaches 56.5p in 2020 – the equivalent of more than three bottles of wine a week for a typical man.

A Treasury source said it was ""impossible"" to forecast whether minimum price would reduce the number of deaths from alcohol related illness, which is currently the highest in Europe.

In the US, experts estimate that over 500,000 people die from alcohol each year – around 1,500 a day – and there are over 2,000 deaths a day due to alcohol in England and Wales.

The group, which is supposed to represent the Syrian people, remains bitterly divided over whether or not to negotiate with the Assad government, how to include moderate Islamists, and whether or not to support the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamist forces operating in the Free Syrian Army as a substitute for Assad. The Muslim Brotherhood has been the Syrian rebels' principal source of arms and training from the beginning, with the aim of ousting Assad who is an Alawite, a Shiite Muslim. Some Syrian rebels have used anti-Semitic language in calling for Assad to go and for Israel to be driven out of Syria.

The most recent dispute between the Patriarchate of Antioch and Egypt and the Patriarchate of Alexandria was during the visit to Egypt of Patriarch Pimen of Antioch in 1992-93; the Patriarch of Alexandria refused to attend the meetings and even expelled the Antiochian delegation and its head, Archbishop Mousa Khoury, from Cairo, and in response, the Antiochian patriarch declared a Holy Synod at the Holy Monastery of Montanita at Mt.

Britain may open its arms to Syrians fleeing the destruction of their homeland and accept up to 2,000 refugees in the coming months. David Cameron has been urged to allow the most vulnerable refugees into Britain following his pledge to protect some Iraqi refugees in the wake of the ISIS attack on Paris, which has killed over 120. Opposition politicians including the Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, who has been increasingly critical of the Tories’ stance on refugees, say Britain should now ‘bring people into this country’. The call is growing louder after it was revealed that thousands of refugees would be allowed into Germany - which has already borne the brunt of the refugee crisis. Germany’s parliament is expected to vote on accepting 20,000 more refugees next week. Mr Clegg and his colleagues are demanding Britain should show the same hospitality, calling on the Prime Minister to abandon his opposition to the idea..

18973,4,"The UN High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR) is calling for Western governments in Europe to take 30,000 Syrian refugees. Why? Because the refugees from Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq are fleeing a war that's already claimed over 100,000 lives, while the West does virtually nothing to stop it.  Why is that? Because Western governments are happy to be in bed with the despotic Arab regimes, which rule with an iron fist while oppressing their people, while they take their money to spend on Western arms manufacturers. There are a number of reasons the US/European arms embargo fails to stop weapons from being sent to the Syrian rebels. The USA has a huge arms market. The weapons end up on the black market where they are sold on to Syria. This weapons transfer then enmeshes a number of other countries in both sides of the conflict. This includes Israel and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis don't have a choice given the current instability in Yemen. What the USA and Europe will gain from shipping arms to Syria is an even greater ability to oppress their people and maintain their power over their own people.

How will this be done?  Two options in my view :
*The UK needs to be independent of the European Union (EU).  Then all of the tariffs can be lifted, which will enable large quantities of steel to be produced here again.
*The UK needs to develop a much, much more efficient steel industry, which will mean higher-quality steel manufactured to the highest possible levels of energy and environmental standards.  This has been achieved in countries that were not part of the EU, such as Japan, with very little help from the EU.  To be competitive in the steel market, the UK will have to be on an equal footing with the EU and to be competing on a level playing field.

1. The collapse of several steelmakers in the last 2 weeks alone has resulted in the loss of thousands of manufacturing job. The number of manufacturing jobs has dropped by about 200,000 since the early 1990s;
2. The collapse of these companies is mainly due to the fact that they are being taken over by cheap steel imports from places like China;
3. The industry requires the Government to act on the following points:
(a) Give steel industry employers the right to lower energy costs of their factories on an immediate and long-term basis to preserve existing jobs and maintain and create new jobs;
(b) Give steel industry employers the right to be able to employ local workers and invest in their own factories through the introduction of a Buy British policy for industry. This would mean that every company that uses steel would have to buy from UK companies such as Tata Steel and Corus;
(c) Give the industry manufacturers the right to lower the energy costs of their furnaces through the introduction of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to invest into upgrading furnaces and new infrastructure at a level that would restore the industry to its former glory.

In short, did he get an advantage by having a history with one of the managers? I'm not sure whether that's a valid consideration, but it's an interesting one I thought might be of interest.

It's not as if he picked up a phone line that said Rodgers was giving the go-ahead and made the move to get in his good books. He knew him when he was managing Reading and Rodgers obviously was an important cog in his time there so I think it makes sense that he would have been considered for a move there.

of imprisonment, he won't have his family to greet him. He won't even have the
basic necessities of life. In his absence, his wife, his daughter and two sons -
nine- and 12-years-old - have no food, no clothes and no money. A year ago, the
family decided to commit suicide.

There are more than 400,000 inmates in prisons across India, with more than half of them awaiting trial.
Under the new guidelines, jail authorities will let death row convicts see their families before execution.
Last year, the family of a man convicted for plotting bomb attacks in Mumbai in 1993 was denied a meeting with him ahead of his hanging.
Another part of the reforms involves the establishment of new legal aid centres, which will aim to provide guidance to poorer inmates, especially those awaiting trial.
The new guidelines also make it mandatory for jail officers to ensure the safety of female prisoners and care for their children.

From the day when Silvio Berlusconi's ```Mani pulite'' or ```Clean Hands'' campaign was launched in the spring of 1985, Italians have lived with the fact that their Prime Minister was no cleaner than anyone else, especially when it came to tax payers' money.

The Italian people have also always understood that Mr. Berlusconi, whatever his faults, was not responsible for everything that happened in Italy, but instead that a lot of it was out of his control, beyond his grasp.

They believe, on their own, that the economic crisis that has hit Italy over the past years is the result of other causes, beyond his own power as Italy's most famous entrepreneur. Many of them still do.

That is why the scandal involving Marcello de Vito and the DRS scandal was able to hurt Mr Berlusconi much less than it has hurt others, past and present. The man who, on the other hand, may have contributed to the very fact that tax payers money ended up in this account to start with, is a man who, like so many others, has always been able to make deals with the tax authorities."

``This decision was not taken to hide the matter from the PAC, nor was it intended to prevent this matter from being investigated by GSOC. ""Given the matter had previously been subject to investigations under the Garda Síochána Act 1996, there was no need for a current State investigation of the matters which had been investigated previously"

While he always sang about his feelings for his lovers in his earlier albums, this time it's different. With the backing of veteran pop songwriters including Max Martin and others more commonly associated with Rihanna or Katy Perry, Timberlake has stepped out of his pop boy-band persona. There are few songs that don't sound as if they could just be performed by anyone. But for as much as he appears to be a one-man show, Timberlake knows his audience and what they'll expect. ""Sexy,"" for example, sounds as if it could have been recorded by Rihanna or Taylor Swift, but it also shows Timberlake's versatility as an artist. What Timberlake does have in abundance is confidence and his own flair, which he lets flow. He's fun to watch."" ```

The PGA Championship - held each August - is the longest-running tournament in PGA Tour history. The event was first played in 1916 and has been held over 100 years. The PGA Championship is held at Whistling Straits in Kohler, Wisconsin at Trump National Golf Club. Trump became the first president and the first owner since 1924 to hold both offices simultaneously in August 2017.[8]

The 2014 tournament was won by Justin Rose. Rose shot three rounds of 66 at Whistling Straits, one of the easier courses played and only missed the cut only once in 11 PGA Championship tournament appearances. Rose was the only non-American to win the PGA Championship since it transitioned to stroke play in 1958. Rose's victory was notable in that it is the first major title ever won on a major championship course designed by three consecutive major winners: architect Gil Hanse (the USPGA), club architect Pete Dye (the PGA) and course designer M.J. Burke (the Open).[12]Rose's victory was also notable in that his win at the Masters the previous month was his first major championship victory, having previously finished second at The Open Championship[13] the two times he played in"

Many protesters are calling on Hong Kong people to behave like sheep, so as to be slaughtered by the government.

Scientists saw little evidence that the pills lowered the risk of cancer, heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s or other diseases. For decades, scientists assumed that the mineral, one of the most popular supplements in Britain, had numerous health benefits. But a review of 462 studies involving more than a million adults has concluded that a lack of vitamin D is not a trigger for many common illnesses. In Britain, the supplements market is worth £700million a year – a growth of 16 per cent in five years – and the most popular pills are multivitamins and fish oils, which contain vitamin D. The main reason scientists thought vitamin D could protect against disease was that patients with cancer, heart disease or Alzheimer’s had very low levels of the nutrient.

  This kind of news scares many consumers, even if it is not ""news"", but something that has been shown in other studies already:
  It is true that vitamins can help, but it is not as simple as a pill.
  A few months ago, for example, a Norwegian study found that vitamin D2 (from rickets) helped in certain cases:

  ""Children with the disease rickets are at a higher risk of developing cancer, heart attacks and strokes. They also have a low vitamin D level that appears protective against this risk.""
  --- The Norwegian article, however, did not find that it helped at all, unless vitamin D2 was given to a group, and then the results went in favor. This shows how it is not as simple as a pill, and that we need to do studies to see how the effect of vitamin D2 in various conditions are."

22748,1,"A massive fire ripped through Elland Road in January 1985. Thirty one people died in that tragedy, but what about the day before, when an inferno engulfed Valley Parade in front of millions of people? For a start there was no fire service in 1983 and a fire prevention officer had not joined Bradford City Council until February 1985. In the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, a fire investigation carried out by West Yorkshire fire service gave evidence of many contributory factors. Some were immediately obvious but some were in the process of being sorted out.
In the immediate aftermath of the fire, West Yorkshire firefighters were told that two people had died. But it wasn’t until later that the true extent of the tragedy was realised. A month later, the fire service had identified 51 fatalities. The bodies of nine children were never found. But this does not mean that they were not there.
In a report commissioned by the city council, fireman Robert Hall outlined the tragedy that unfolded on Wednesday, 12 May 1985. At 11:30 a.m. an electrical fire broke out in an upper storey of Valley Parade, home to Bradford City football club.

Robert Hall was 12 at the time and remembers his family being told to go to Huddersfield for that weeks match at Valley Parade.

After the stadium gates had closed and the crowd had dwindled, the people remained to watch the game on television at the local pub. He does not recall what went wrong.

But he does remember an incredible scene when it was finally over. People poured onto the pitch and into the streets, shouting and celebrating with cups of tea.

Robert says the joy is long gone.

Huddersfield had won the match and their relegation rivals Bradford had failed to score.

At the time it was a major shock to a city that for many years had been used to seeing its teams do well.

He feels the scenes on Sunday would have been similar had Bradford FC not been relegated.

He has watched some other important matches at Valley Parade since, but it will always remain the place that a football match got out of hand and into some of the most shocking scenes Bradfordites have seen.

A total of 528 persons were evacuated from the stadium as flames engulfed the stand. The cause of the fire was never officially confirmed, but speculation mounted as to how a fire could start in the under-structure of such a modern stadium.

One in three foreign suspects turns out to have previous convictions abroad

5 live Investigates Investigates

A BBC investigation into foreign offenders being dealt with differently in Britain's police forces has found convictions for the most serious sex and violent crimes in England and Wales are being ignored.

An undercover team took a year to investigate how officers in 17 forces, which made up almost three-quarters of all arrests on foreign nationals last year, dealt with the more serious cases.

The team, called 6 live Investigates, found that while many forces often consulted foreign records, the rate in Cleveland was only about 6% and in Greater Manchester 8%.

The findings come despite a 2006 Home Office report calling for co-ordinated co-operation between countries to prevent serious foreign offenders from entering the UK"
17314,2,"Cleveland Police said all foreign suspects were now referred to Acro for further checks when necessary.

""We believe this is a positive step and is improving the number of cases of people entering the country with previous convictions,"" said the force.

""This has only been achieved through training all officers, all of whom are subject to an enhanced CRB check, and only taking action when necessary.""

The national police contact centre said most forces outside Greater Manchester also consulted Acro, and some were sending checks to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NfIB) in London.

The latest Home Office statistics showed the rate of suspected foreign offenders arriving in the UK without a record from abroad was only about 6% in the last 12 months.

The police also said that since December, when the new law on stopping an aircraft at the UK's borders to search passengers came into force, nearly 40,000 checks had been taken.
Cleveland Police would not reveal how many of these were carried out on foreign suspects.

But Greater Manchester Police said they had checked all foreign suspects, including the arrest of an Afghan man who was found carrying a knife and two mobile phones.

WHEN CHECKS ARE CARRIED OUT, AS MANY AS ONE IN THREE FOREIGN SUSPECTS TURNS OUT TO HAVE PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS ABROAD
By Andrew Morris'

Published: 12/09/2005

''The rate of foreign nationals arrested during 2005 by Cleveland Police who have previous convictions abroad is much higher than that in all other forces in the north of England. A total of 362 out of 4,822 suspects who were detained from 1 March to 30 June this year have a previous conviction abroad. There will no doubt be many who say that these individuals should not be living in the UK in the first place. But the UK compares very well with those other European countries that have recently joined the EU [European Union]. For example, in Sweden 12% of the foreign nationals who were arrested during 2005 and 2004 had a previous conviction. And a high proportion of those were from Sweden.
Among those arrested from outside the European Economic Area, only those who had a previous conviction were picked out for a criminal record check by Cleveland Police. But for those who were detained abroad there was little effort made to check their records.
Cleveland Police said improvement was needed"

A Home Office spokeswoman said the department would ""use every possible power to stop foreign criminals from coming into this country"". The spokeswoman insisted that all passengers were checked against police, security and immigration watch lists on arrival and individuals who posed a risk were refused entry. In October, the government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office (NAO), issued a report called Managing and Removing Foreign National Offenders. It revealed that last year police had cross-checked the criminal records of only about 30% of people from overseas they arrested. One of the report's recommendations was that officers should refer more foreign arrests to the Association of Chief Police Officers' Criminal Records Office (Acro), which has access to overseas police files.

So when I saw that Channel 4 would cover this game, it brought back real fond memories of what the NFL meant to me. When people would ask me about my favourite footballing moment, the top three were always:

#1) The moment Emmo left to go and kick a last second field goal for the Jets after Joe Montana had the ball at the one yard line
#2) The first time I saw a video where Terrell Owens had pulled a 'Dunk on the Great One' (or, when I looked it up later, the 'Lombardisque Catch')
#3) The time Emmo walked out of his endzone with a touchdown

I've always loved watching the Giants play the Broncos - Peyton Manning is by far my favourite QB to watch. I've also always loved watching the Patriots - they seem to have a way of beating the Giants somehow.

Bryan Knowles, chief football writer of Philadelphia Sunday News

Sunday, October 1 1

If the Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants were to square off in the NFL’s version of a Premier League title race, the Giants would be flying high with four wins from their opening five games to the Eagles’ three - albeit against opponents who, with the exception of Tampa Bay, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Jacksonville Jaguars, are in the division’s bottom half.

The Giants can level the Eagles’ one-point lead at the top of the NFC East with victory at Lincoln Financial Field on Sunday (a Giants supporter’s worst nightmare).

This is one of the hardest and toughest rivalries that the league has to offer

QPR boss Harry Redknapp is under no illusions about that fact, but has given the players one thing at least with regards to their pay demands.

After taking over at the start of the season from the former boss Iain Dowie, Redknapp was faced with a host of long-term injuries at Loftus Road.
The QPR boss has only managed to put that right this week by adding several players to his squad.
That includes young central defender Jordan Houghton, 20, who has arrived from Wolverhampton Wanderers, and versatile midfielder Stefan Johansen, 22, who moves from Fulham.
Former Blackburn Rovers utility man Johansen, who also played as a winger on occasion for the Championship club, should add another element to a midfield already featuring England cap Joey Barton and former Norwich City ace Niko Kranjcar.
Houghton also brings something of a freshness to the Rangers defence after impressing during spells on loan last season at Crewe Alexandra and Oldham Athletic.

In the meantime, the club also completed a surprise swoop for goalkeeper Bobby Mimms from West Ham United.

they would probably be completely unacceptable to most of the

Inflation and demand destruction are having an impact on the China economy.
Economist Li-Gang Liu believes the weakness of the yuan is a result of the Chinese currency being set at market levels rather than having a government floor value. He says there was a miscommunication between the central bank and the government.
'''

'''For background   of currency    &   devaluation    see:

This may mean that China is starting to allow the market to set the exchange rate based on the spot rate today.

A devaluation is generally seen as a move by a central bank to make its exports cheaper.
Economists often interpret devaluations as the central bank accepting that the local economy is suffering. This could be linked to the demand destruction caused as a result of fears over the impact of the eurozone debt crisis.

The central bank has said that it has no immediate plans to devalue. It has said this is in an effort to support the economy, which is struggling with increasing inflation and a deceleration in the growth rate.

""I didn’t understand how to drink until after I got bronze. I did everything and anything to find some sense of self worth and it didn’t occur to me that I could just go out and have fun,""

Daley said on BBC1 tonight.

‘It is important for me to remain positive because I do think it has helped me.""

:: Daley, a student at the University of Plymouth, said: ""That person is not just a boyfriend, but my best friend as well. It’s quite amazing and I’m so lucky. But it hasn’t changed me fundamentally as a person. We’re still in the same situation we’ve been in before.

21756,1,"1. The levy

The levy is a tax on banks' profits, levied at 0.2% for domestic banks with assets under £1bn, and at 0.5% for banks with assets of more than £150bn. It is levied on balance sheets, not income or assets, and so its impact on bank profitability is neutral. It does therefore have the virtue of being progressive, at present only levied on banks with greater assets than UK savers, but in the future only on banks with greater liabilities than UK savers. In a future, probably more global trading, world (banks will have assets abroad and liabilities abroad), it should become progressive, just as the capital charge is progressive at present. The Government says only a small fraction of the levy will be spent on banks' activities, the rest will be used to pay down the debt of the National Debt Reduction Fund. The tax is paid by all banks operating in the UK and so should be progressive.
The Government will cut the levy further, probably to 0.15% in January 2016. This will give banks the money they need for lending to households and corporates, as well as for paying dividends and bonuses.

  2. The reform

Two points:

-"
21756,2,"Article: Following the July Budget, banks will have to pay an 8% tax charge on profits of more than £25m, starting next year.
At the same time, the bank levy, which affects the larger banks, will be gradually reduced.
But the small banks argue that the new tax will harm their ability to lend money, and they want it reformed.
""The only way to address the too-big-to-fail problem is to foster the development of smaller banks,"" said Paul Lynam, the chief executive of Secure Trust Bank, one of the smaller banks involved.
Speaking on Radio 4, he argued that the bigger banks have other unfair advantages.
""The amount of capital that the smaller banks are required to hold, relative to the larger banks, is disproportionately punitive,"" he said.
However Chancellor George Osborne has previously argued that the new 8% surcharge is fair, and will increase competition.
The bank levy, which is calculated according to the size of bank's balance sheets, will be reduced in January from 0.21% to 0.18%.
It will subsequently be cut further.
Large banks like HSBC and Standard Chartered had complained that they were penalised, because the levy applies to operations abroad, as"

Teresita D. Sison, 58, was knocked as she and her daughter walked towards Hyde Park at 11.38 on 21 October when the tree was uprooted in the high wind.
The inquest into her death has been told the tree appeared stable at the time and that it would have taken a strong gust to topple it, said Andrew Greenhill, the London and Westminster coroner.
The inquest was told that the five officers at first worked on helping to redirect traffic around the accident but later thought the tree was in a fixed enough situation to make sure that pedestrians would not walk through it.
In CCTV footage captured from a number of camera angles, the inquest heard how Mrs Sison and her daughter walked through the natural archway formed by the tree and it was later seen by another worker how the archway was filled with branches of the tree.
However, the worker's camera did not capture Mrs Sison being hit by any piece of falling masonry.

The United States and other states around the world are involved in many military operations, mostly military interventions. These actions are often undertaken with the purpose of strengthening particular states. The purpose and effectiveness of military interventions are often undervalued by analysts and politicians. This is especially true for those instances of armed intervention conducted with the support of major world powers, such as NATO members and the U.S. In these cases, military intervention is almost always linked to political and economic interests.

The official said Ankara remained committed to the cessation as a way to avoid further bloodshed.
Russia, a staunch ally of Assad, said it was committed to the cessation deal, as did the US, although State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Washington was also watching the reports that fighting on the ground had not abated.

After getting the best start to a season in his long racing career, suddenly getting such a serious injury is a huge setback... It's a shame the team had to drop Alonso without the opportunity for any kind of a trial or test since the injury couldn't be examined.

He was always going to race in Bahrain - he was always just going to do so in the simulator for a few weeks first.
This won't affect him racing at Monaco - the FIA Medical Commission ruled back in 2014 that the amount of physical training Alonso would go through in two week would likely result in similar injuries.

I can't understand how they could have failed to have made an alternative driver available for the race given that the team has been forced to switch to a different chassis and engine. McLaren have had to do this before and it seems bizarre to force any driver into a situation where they're going to be running around on a track they have had minimal time to familiarise themselves with.

They dominated but were extremely wasteful up front – missing three one-on-ones and then Wayne Rooney’s chance which he missed at 2-0. At 2-1 the stadium went quiet and as soon as Shakhtar scored their second United found it harder to keep their energy levels up. They survived and so did Louis van Gaal. A clean sheet was vital and, even though United never looked quite sure at the back in the closing stages, they did just that. For the Dutchman it’s a big win and a big save. United didn’t play at their level at Old Trafford two weeks ago, and it’s important for them to get the monkey off their backs.

13 September 2015
In a speech to the House of Commons Mr Cameron said Britain had a duty to help people in need and more effort was needed to ensure these families were resettled in safe, secure and better-run camps.
He argued the approach was better than allowing refugees to enter the country and then making them wait up to two years for an asylum decision - something which had happened in Hungary in 2015.
Prime Minister David Cameron has been under pressure from within the Conservative Party to change the government's policy on migrants entering the UK or allowing more places on the government resettlement scheme in Turkey.
Mr Cameron told a House of Commons meeting: ""If we want to help people without putting them in danger of abuse at the hands of smugglers, without putting them at greater risk of exploitation, we have to work to stop children coming to Europe in the first"
6255,3,"The Prime Minister, David Cameron, has announced his plan to expand the UK's offer of safe haven to people fleeing conflict in Syria. He said that Britain will take an extra 20,000 people who are currently in conflict zones in the Middle East and Africa.

Speaking in parliament, Mr Cameron said:

""It shows that where Britain steps forward then America will step forward. The United States has today announced a decision it won't take this [20,000] number because they've already taken in 11,000 people.

""Britain will take a further 5,000. And America will take a further 10,000. And that means that Britain will take 20,000 people from conflict zones in the Middle East to the UK over the course of the year. And America will take 10,000 from conflict zones in the Middle East to the US.

""We're talking in Europe today about 20,000 people [from Syria]. We're talking about 30,000 people, 50,000 people, whatever. The truth is - we need to accept far more, frankly, from Europe and the rest of the continent. But these people are fleeing for life.

""They're not fleeing for a holiday. We need to"
6255,4,"The Conservative Party has decided it can't keep fighting over who is in charge of Britain's response to the refugee crisis. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, has set out his plan. It's to bring 2,000 refugees from ""the most desperate, most war-torn parts of the world"" to Britain. And it has the backing of the Church of England, faith groups and churches.

  He said the refugees will come from camps bordering Syria rather than those who are already in Europe.
It's understood they will be mainly from Syria and Eritrea, who are desperately trying to escape, rather than those who have already reached Europe. They would stay on in the UK. Meanwhile the UK will support the Geneva Refugee Convention in Geneva which Mr Cameron said Britain will meet.

     A lawyer for one of the six suspects facing trial, Munir Hassan Mohammed, 36, a Somali refugee, accused Assistant Chief Constable David Crompton, of the British National Crime Agency, of being responsible for leaks that resulted in the arrest of his client and the others.

     But the judge, Alistair McCreath, said there had been nothing in the evidence to suggest that the leaks had taken place.

     Mr. Crompton denied any connection with the investigation and said that journalists who had used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain details about possible suspects were to blame for any breach of privacy.

The trial is expected to last two months and is expected to raise serious questions over whether MI5, the Crown Prosecution Service and the police are up-to-date with how to tackle far-right terrorism in modern Britain.
The police have been criticised in the past for failing to monitor far-right groups closely.

It had long been rumoured that the UK police had been infiltrated by far-right skinheads, but the arrest of members of the English Defence League for similar offences last year prompted a review into how serious the problem was.

It is a role he performed for three games when Middlesbrough boss Tony Mowbray left his previous club Norwich City - but it is not yet clear whether Venus may stop at Coventry.

""I'm privy to all the conversations with the board. I'm very much included. It's an ongoing process. We just have to take our time and pick the right candidate.""
A suspension of betting by bookmakers triggered rumours of an announcement, but Coventry City Football Club have advised that it will not happen this week.

However, behavioural data suggest that EE remains constant, despite reports of people eating less. In other words, people have been misreporting their EE for decades. This may explain the recent rise in obesity-related diseases, which is in sharp contrast to the significant improvements in public health of the past 20 years. In the long run, we feel government policy would be better-served by encouraging people to reduce their EE than to promote exercise.'' (See here for a summary of the study itself).

The report ""A Nudge away from food"" by Dr Michael Hallsworth
The British government is planning to re-launch its war against obesity by increasing the size of nutritional information packages with calories, salt, fat and sugar -- all calculated based on the average of three or four servings as opposed to the more realistic of a single serving.
This is just as the chief statistician Dr David Manning is telling the British Statistics & Public Affairs Association (STPA) that official evidence suggests the public are eating substantially less calories than the surveys suggest. This is the very evidence he is a spokesperson for.
The BIT claims that if the surveys were accurate, the problem of obesity in the UK would be much less acute than it is (i.e. it would be a smaller problem than it is) than official data suggest:

63218,2,"A team of UK researchers have called on government statisticians to investigate how much people are eating, in order to better understand how to better control obesity.
In their study, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), they say that official data suggests people are eating about 1,000 calories more per person every day than official surveys suggest.
They say that could explain why the rate of obesity in the UK has continued to rise while more people say they are eating fewer calories.
The researchers suggested that a number of methods could be used to help people accurately report what they eat - including providing food tracking apps, and counting the energy in snacks that people eat.

They also suggest the government could use official statistics to more accurately calculate the national calorie intake as well as the amount of time people spend in exercise.
The researchers say that, if we could get more people eating less, and getting more exercise, obesity rates could be reduced.
Experts welcomed the findings.

Professor Susan Jebb from Oxford University, who is an expert in nutrition, said:

""This research may explain in part how the UK obesity epidemic has continued unabated despite decades of official claims of progress towards 'healthy' diets,"" she said.
""It is clear"
63218,3,"### Background ### The UK has consistently reported a decrease in 'normal' or 'healthy' adults over decades, an increase in obesity over the same period, and a sharp increase in morbid obesity in the past decade. This trend has attracted attention in the press, policy circles, and from both industry and academic researchers, with some concluding that policy responses have fallen short. This paper presents an alternative hypothesis: that while physical activity has fallen, average calorie consumption has increased. We propose that changes to national data collection methods may be exacerbating this trend, and that changing our dietary and intake habits could be better targeted, and potentially more effective, than many have realized. ### The Problem ### The National Health Survey publishes calorie counts on the foods and drinks we purchase and consume. Since its inception in 1973 until 2011, this calorie count, known as the 'Calorie Count Value', has not changed substantially through the period. More recently, the calorie count was revised downward based on survey responses; however, we can see from the graph below how it remained fairly steady between 2009 and 2011, when the revised figure was set, even as obesity rates rose. ## Analysis ## Using NCHS as an example, we find that current survey estimates of calorie intake (in Kcal/day) are"

UN Urged to Investigate Rape in Congo

By DAVID BROOKS
Monday, August 7, 2006; Page A01

KINSHASA, Congo - Two armed groups raped more than 150 women in a village in the volatile North Kivu province in the Democratic Republic of Congo in a four-day spree, a United Nations official said Monday.

The attacks happened last month and members of a U.N. human rights team said it confirmed the attacks.

``Victims of the attack, which occurred on 30 July in the village of Bunangiri are receiving medical treatment and have also been provided psycho-social care,'' the U.N. officials said in a statement.

In the statement U.N. officials said the culprits were insurgents loyal to the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda. The ethnic Hutu militia has been linked the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 and has been been battling Congo government forces recently. Aid group International Medical Corps said it is treating the women and had more details about the rape spree that they say went on for days.

""The incident began when armed men entered a local village, urging the population not to flee by convincing them that they were only there"
65935,2,"Terrified civilians in North Kivu Province in the Democratic Republic of Congo may have found an unlikely  ally: a war criminal.``

This has not been the intention of the author, of course, but the conflict in eastern DRC is complicated and it's often the case that all sides in a conflict may use or condone similar crimes.

  It is a bit frustrating because when a good news item like this pops up then the news about the war in east Congo has gone out and all that's left is bad or bad - with very little in between.

The other side of things in the fighting in east Congo does seem to be that the Congolese army (FARDC) have now deployed armoured forces into the city of Beni in North Kivu province. They have already seen heavy fighting during the last few days but have not met with much success.

  I don't know if these forces are part of a UN mission or not but if so they are a very small amount and I question what kind of training they can receive when they are going up against a sophisticated, well organised and very motivated fighter in Rwandan troops with lots of support.

In the last month or so we have seen all the usual"

It's like having a lot of high turnover. The train operators will have to have a much tighter check of prospective drivers or maybe more of those people from Eastern Europe who come here to work in jobs like catering so they can send back money home to their families.
When I left London Midland in 2006 the train drivers were not only better paid they got full holiday and a full week's pay when they finished work for the day. This has now been completely removed and for all intents and purposes there's no pay in the company at all.
The whole thing is a shambles now and its only a massive scandal for the passenger when something goes wrong and trains are cancelled because the service has been made so much worse by the lack of staff.
They should just cancel their franchises altogether as we cannot rely on them to provide us with a good and reliable train service, that goes totally against the very nature of the railways.

Patrick Verwer, the incoming director of London Midland and the first external hire since Arriva took over the franchise, did not commit to these points.

Aslef, the union for train drivers, claimed that the new London Midland management had been unwilling to increase pay, to guarantee that pay would increase for at least five years, and that it had been refusing to address a “persistent” shortage of drivers.

83431,2,"The last month has given us the chance to see our direction and how we can improve it... We don`t need to be radical... We have to be smart about it and keep everything under control.'' - Swansea manager Michael Laudrup, in an open letter to fans.

Swansea's American owners, Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan, have pledged the club's survival, with the Welsh club sitting only one point and one place above the bottom three.
""I think all Swansea supporters know that they were important players last year,"" Bradley told BBC Radio 5 live.

""When players like that leave, not only do you lose the talent they had on the field, but both of those players were strong figures in the dressing room.""

Bradley secured his first win as manager as Swansea beat Crystal Palace 5-4 on Saturday in a dramatic game at the Liberty Stadium.

He says he has looked at what the club did right last year, instead of dwelling on their poor form this season.

""I spent some time during the international break a few weeks ago watching a few games from last season where I thought the team played well,"" said Bradley.

""I am trying to give a simple message that helps them feel"

The article mentions that Accenture came to London to help police tackle violent crime. The technology is developed by Accenture and called Big Data Analytics.

The software analyses a person's criminal history and posts on social media to assess how likely it is for them to commit a crime. It was able to analyse social media posts such as the image above, posted by a gang who stole a fleet of expensive, high-performance cars last year. London's Metropolitan Police have tested a system that analyses a person's criminal history and...  This is what the software did when it analyzed the social media posts of London gang members:

Police then compared the software's results to known acts of violence that took place in the fifth year of the experiment to find out its accuracy.

89460,2,"A London police force is trialling a tool that can predict which gang members are most likely to reoffend and stop their crimes before they happen. Police in the London borough of Newham found that gang members who use social media more often were more likely to commit a violent crime - but the tool proved to be 100 to 200 percent accurate in identifying who was most likely to reoffend. The technology, devised by consultancy Accenture, uses previous crimes to provide an individual with a score on a scale of zero to one which indicates how likely they are to reoffend in a given year. Those who score above zero are flagged to police, who then conduct an investigation. By looking at social media posts, police can predict when gang members will commit a crime. Last year, police in Newham took part in a pilot project using social media to test if technology could pick out gang members who are most likely to reoffend using data from police data systems. In Newham, about 17 percent of the local population are of a black, Asian or ethnic minority, but the largest ethnic minority gang in the borough is made up of Caribbean and Indian men. The project used social media posts to assess which were most likely to commit a violent crime later in the year and acted"

A new system will be introduced later this month that is designed to identify violent criminals before they commit a crime or harm someone.

Social media posts can now be analysed to assess an individual's likelihood of committing future crimes, and will then be used to determine who is most at risk of reoffending, the head of the city's biggest crime lab, has told British MPs.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan Howe confirmed that its PredPol tool, which analyses the online posts of known gang members, would now be made available to all 32 police forces in England and Wales.

The system, developed by global consulting firm Accenture, was introduced in 2008 and helps officers identify, then track down and apprehend the group of criminals.

It is the second new piece of software to have been approved by Mr Hogan-Howe during his four-year tenure at the top of the police force with police chiefs aiming to provide more preventative and preventative crime tactics to officers as well as boosting investigations.

PredPol has been used since the spring of 2013 and is used in the ""worst-hit"" areas of North Wales and London, known respectively as Operation Trident and Project Trident"

London Metropolitan Police are to trial software that analyses profiles on social networks such as Twitter and Facebook to predict crime within a 20 mile radius and track gang members who are reoffending, senior police and technology officials have said.

The software is being trialled as part of Operation Trident, set up to crackdown on the London drugs trade, and will use information from Facebook to identify members of two rival gangs who have a history of violence and who are likely to reoffend. It will identify both users of the sites and anyone who has been tagged in the past.

However, critics will argue it is a dangerous development that will increase the police's use of technology at a time when officers are already using more stop and search data, and the use of automatic number plate recognition technology that allows officers to identify the car and owner before they have stopped the vehicle.

The Met's head of technology and innovation, Paul Smith, said the software, which will be tested in the coming months, will give police more information about known offenders and offenders who are likely to commit crimes before the offense happens.

The Trident nuclear cruise missile is a short-range, submarine-launched cruise missile intended to destroy large concentrations of military and civilian targets. Its development began in 1975 through a joint United Kingdom-United States effort and was introduced into the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force fleets in the 1980s. The Trident missile replaced the Polaris missile and is a derivative of the Land-based Prompt Global Strike Missile (LPGSM) (though it had different specifications and systems developed from it before it was introduced into service). In service since 1992, the Vanguard-class submarines are designed to be able to reach their targets within 15 minutes after launching. Each submarine has a crew of 70 and is powered by reactor A. The missiles on board have a range of about 1500km. They use atmospheric nuclear propulsion, and a passive heat-seeking seeker.

Major General Tim Crossman was the only witness at the Royal Navy inquiry into the loss of the HMS Tireless nuclear warship, which is expected to conclude today. The inquiry is investigating the cause and circumstances of the loss of the Royal Navy frigate off the coast of Cyprus in June 2008. The ship, while carrying out a routine patrol, was taken by surprise by a Russian submarine and the loss of more than 100 crew. On Wednesday last week, the Royal Navy released a report from its own inquiry into the incident that the Ministry of Defence’s response did not meet “adequate standards”. It found that the navy’s response to the incident was “slow and ineffective”, that the navy’s senior management, which included the commanding officer on the ship, did not pass “properly” the information needed to be able to act “in a timely way”.

The following list details where the option could be sited, and whether there is a suitable infrastructure in place to support it:-- 1 The location of HMS Victorious, a Type 23 frigate, already has a berth, and would become the headquarters of the Home Fleet. It could also become a military base (but not one with any nuclear weapons on site), although it is unknown what effect this would have on Faslane which will be needed to continue to sustain the deterrent. This option cannot be ruled out because it is unlikely that Faslane could be redeveloped to a full military base. 2 In 2008, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) commissioned a report on the issue from military architecture firm Arup. It examined the possibility of moving the deterrent from Scotland to either Wales (Milford Haven) or Northern Ireland (Fingral), based on the fact that the MoD’s ‘strategy’ had been to"

The Daily Mail has learned that senior military commanders have begun examining options for putting the system which is now based at Clyde in the Firth of Clyde. The aim would be to enable continued sea patrols by the Vanguard-class submarines and to prevent any risk of disruption should there be a second referendum to break up the UK. The MoD insists that it doesn't have to move. It will continue to monitor political developments and work to protect the country from any possible future Scottish breakup. It will monitor events as they unfold and, as a prudent Government, keep all its options open. 'All our defence infrastructure in Scotland and Northern Ireland is protected by the UK as a whole including the Trident submarines, as demonstrated by Nato. There is no requirement on UK government to relocate or provide the equipment for any other government in the UK,' it said in a statement. It said it wanted to give full commitment to keeping all parts of the Trident system in place at Faslane, and that any UK government would maintain that.

75596,1,"In 2010, the Dominican government sold $5 billion in treasury notes, which are basically short-term bonds. Last week, the country sold $2 billion in more of the so-called TND notes, in total selling $4 billion in short-term securities, according to Reuters. These notes have a coupon rate of 9% (currently about 0.4%). They mature in March, 2014, the same month that the U.S. Fed begins to taper its bond purchases. Given the U.S. central bank's track record, the prospect of an earlier-than-expected rate hike could result in a sell-off of emerging-market securities. Meanwhile, a weaker peso has weighed on the country's competitiveness, compounding a number of other issues, including a slowdown, a contracting construction sector, an aging workforce, a falling dollar and an excess of dollars in the market. It's this last group which is helping power the demand for the notes, according to the Reuters news source (an excerpt, no paywall).

The Dominican Republic has been celebrating the 'Air Show of the Caribbean' as part of the 'Dominican Air & Naval Celebration', in the capital city of Santo Domingo.

After a short takeoff in front of thousands of spectators on the Santo Domingo waterfront, two military pilots in two small planes collided, one of them ending up in the sea, according to witnesses.

One of the planes had just managed to take off when it collided in the air with the other, both of which then started to spin out of control.

The accident led to the death of the pilots while dozens of people around them ran up the gangplank, screaming 'Help, help'.

The two military planes collided in the air in front of thousands of spectators attending the Air Show of the Caribbean festival and plunged into the sea 500 meters from the waterfront.

The wreckage of one of the planes was recovered by the Dominican Republic's army and navy yesterday.

The wreckage of the crashed vehicle had partially disassembled upon impact.

* More than 8,000 people were at the Sunday afternoon crash site.

* The crash took place the site of a local air show celebrating the island nation's 200th anniversary.

* The plane crashed into the water in front of thousands of spectators gathered on the Santo Domingo waterfront.

The pilot reported that the plane started to lose altitude. He regained height and started a steep bank, but that maneuver brought on a rapid descent that destroyed the plane.

As spectators ran through the water, the local air show was canceled. The pilot's body was pulled from the wreckage and taken to a hospital.

|The Mazda RX8, a sports car developed in 1998 and sold in Japan in the United States and Europe in 1999, was recalled in 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002 in the US.  A total of 33,928 vehicles were recalled (33,928 cars). In 2002, Mazda said there had been no confirmed accidents or serious injuries related to the problem of the air fuel ratio control system in the MX-5 and RX-8.

The vehicle has twin-rotor rotary engines called SKYACTIV 2 (in Mazda's lexicon, that's the engine that started the rotary engine revolution, a ""revolutionary engine""); in 2002, Mazda discontinued the SKYACTIV branding but has replaced the engines in the cars with a version of the SKYACTIV 2 called ""XEV"". These newer engines, however, are the only rotary engines Mazda has ever put in anything, so the brand is still officially Mazda 2 Rotary (it's been Mazda 6 Rotary since the 1990s).

How did it go down? According to ABC News, an airline worker discovered a hole in the shipping crate in which the money was being transported when it landed at JFK Airport. A little more digging revealed that forklift operators at a Switzerland-based shipping company had been repeatedly tampering with the crates because their job descriptions had changed as shipping rates had fallen. The investigation led to a forklift driver, who was then immediately suspended, according to the NYPD. He took a lie detector test (as everyone at"

````Editor,

Your decision to publish a column about sexism in the BBC is to be applauded. Even though the BBC has been more progressive than any other organisation for women with respect to equality of employment opportunity, it still has a long way to go in the way of equal pay. And, although it has got its act together financially, there are still too many cases where top talent gets paid more simply because of their gender.

In the past, I would have agreed with the argument, but the issue of equal pay has changed my mind.

I now think that, just as I can be more or less paid than a man in almost any occupation based on my own performance, men and women can be more or less paid for their programming skills on the basis of their genders. On top of that, there’s the whole question of how much women are paid for being"

Headline: Atletico beat Inter to lift Super Cup

In summary: After a slow start, Atletico Madrid beat Inter Milan 2-0 to win the European Super Cup in Monaco. Spain striker Luis Fabiano won and converted a decisive penalty in the second half, after substitute Sergio Aguero had put the Europa League winners ahead early in the half. The match in the Mediterranean principality came just six days after Atletico won the first major honour in the club's history, securing the Europa League for the first time by beating Sevilla 3-2 on penalties after drawing 3-3 in the final at Milan's San Siro stadium. The Spanish team's first continental trophy also brought a record 12th European Cup/Europa League final appearance for the club, while Inter were aiming to become the first Italian winners of the Super Cup since Juventus beat AC Milan 3-2 on penalties in Milan in 1983. Atletico were the more organised and more clinical, and took the lead when midfielder Joaquin put them ahead just before the break. After a tentative opening half,"

Norfolk fishing industry fears long-term exclusion from planned windfarm
Last Updated: 01:11, 4 December 2009

  The companies that are building Britain's biggest-ever windfarm have agreed compensation with fishermen who may be excluded from it.

  Dong Energy and Ørsted have today unveiled the full details of a deal with North Norfolk fishing boats who were concerned that they would be shut out of the industry for years.
  Fishery owners have previously been locked in a dispute with the Danish-based energy giants, and today's announcement at Wells provides a much-needed resolution to the impasse.

  The Race Bank Offshore Wind Farm, located between the Isle of Wight and North Norfolk, is due to be completed in about five years' time.

  It is part of Ørsted's 3.2 billion dollar (£2.1 billion) East Anglian Offshore Wind Farm, also known as the Humber-Bury Offshore Wind Farm.

""The last time a German looked this hot was when they were pushing Jews into the ovens,"" Rivers said. The Anti-Defamation League called the remark ""vulgar and hideous,"" but Rivers, who is Jewish, said it is her way of getting people to talk. ""It's a joke No. 1.  No. 2 it is about the Holocaust. This is the way I remind people about the Holocaust. I do it through humor,"" she told HLN's ""Showbiz Tonight."" When asked by host A.J. Hammer why she won't apologize, Rivers said, ""For what?"" She also said critics should focus on people who have anti-Semitic views and not someone whose late husband lost his entire family during the Holocaust. ""Of all people, Joan Rivers should know better,"" Abraham H. Foxman, ADL national director, said in a statement posted on the organization's website"
1340,1,"We have to be careful about trivializing the Holocaust. What Joan Rivers said was really disgusting, and she just doesn't realize how offensive she is. Her point was that there were many victims of the Holocaust who weren't glamorous like Heidi Klum, so she'd never make a reference to Anne Frank. Rivers was making a joke, and she was also trying to draw attention to the lack of glamour associated with the Holocaust.

Joan Rivers has a right"
1340,2,"The Los Angeles-based Anti-Defamation League said Monday its national director was ''shocked and appalled'' at a gag told by Joan Rivers during her ''Fashion Police'' commentary on the Oscars red carpet.

Rivers said Monday the Holocaust joke, with which she began last week's show and then again during the show, was an attempt to get people to think about the horrific genocide during World War II and the millions of people killed by the Nazis.

''It's a joke No. 1, and No. 2 it is about the Holocaust. It is about the Jewish people, and this is the way I remind people about the Holocaust,'' Rivers told ''Showbiz Tonight.'' ''I do it through humor.''

The Anti-Defamation League on its website said: ''We call on Joan Rivers to apologize immediately for this vulgar and hideous remark. There are certain things about the Holocaust that should be taboo. This is especially true for Jews, for whom the Holocaust is still a deeply painful memory.''

Joan Rivers, who is Jewish, told HLN's ''Showbiz Tonight'' that she meant what she said, adding that she was surprised the ADL hadn't caught on to the joke before she delivered it."

That's not necessarily a positive, depending on who you think makes the final 23.
Vardy is a striker. England generally doesn't call strikers up, unless it's a case of injuries or a good form.
He could get a chance if a player gets injured. That is the best case scenario for England.

He's in the best year of his career, has a decent goals-to-games record in the English top league, and in a team that wins. He has the sort of stats that English strikers tend to do well with.
If you say that England don't usually call strikers up, I would expect that the evidence would be England's current crop of strikers. (Holtby, Carroll, Benteke, Sinclair? Pickford?)
I'm not saying he'll play, he just has a far better chance than the players you mentioned.

I know I am just speculating about the situation, but if United play (for example) 4-3-3 with 3 central defenders, I think that the central midfield will play the role of a central defence. If it's a 4-2-3-1 system, it will be a defensive midfielder who will play one of the defensive roles. In this cases the second central midfielder will more or less be a defender or at least midfielder, and he will have the support of a defensive midfielder, as Fernandes.

Analyst: U.S. should not be allowed to invade Iran

The U.S. should not be allowed to invade Iran, and the Bush administration probably will not be successful in its efforts to overthrow the Iranian government with regime change, former U.S. Representative Ron Paul said in an interview on Saturday.

'I can imagine the White House and the neocon gangsters being willing to fight another 10,000, and maybe even 20,000 lives -- but we shouldn't take chances of another four or five million' -- the number of lives that would be lost in an Iran war, Paul said -- if it can't be avoided. That is unlikely, according to Paul, a doctor and former Republican Texas politician who currently lives in Austin, since the situation in Iraq and the ongoing occupation of Afghanistan ""shows these guys no respect.""

The Bush administration's plan to impose a strict no-fly zone over Iran, a plan designed to prevent the Iraqi military, which is allied with Iran, from attacking U.S. and coalition forces, in addition to any attacks by Iran against Coalition forces, ""probably will not work,"" Paul said. Iran, in fact, has been successful in forcing U.S. forces"

The United States and Pakistan both appear to be working towards burying what may have been a mistake - the al Qaeda terrorist leader who has evaded American forces for nearly a decade, Osama bin Laden, was found at the garrison town of Abbottabad on May 2.

The al Qaeda leader was found with no resistance whatsoever after his home in Abbottabad was stormed. Several of the men who moved the terror leader later told interrogators that he had been dead for more than a year, and an autopsy conducted by a Pakistani doctor concluded that bin Laden had died from ""a burst of bullets during the assault,"" according to CNN. His death reportedly was caused by a heart attack and renal failure.

However, the story is not clear-cut. Officials at the Pentagon said that ""evidence has emerged that some Pakistani security services had advance knowledge, may even have led to the raid,"" according to CNN.

""What we're beginning to establish is that our relationship with these people is not nearly as good as we had supposed,'' one official said. ''There were some Pakistani elements in the lead up and some elements within the security services who must have been on"

* Unsubstantiated Russia story raises questions for Trump
By David Smith in New York
Sunday, 21 Nov 2004 09:45 EDT

Mr Trump, 69, is due to hold a news conference on Wednesday, nine days before he assumes the presidency, in an attempt to separate himself from his business commitments, to address concerns about conflicts of interest.

Mr Trump's campaign is ""being buffeted by the story,"" said David Gergen, former adviser to presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.

""The president-elect is very much aware that this is out there, and it's beginning to cast a pall over the new administration,"" he said.
...
Mr Trump's press conference has been put back repeatedly from an original date of 14 November after questions about his financial interests and on Saturday reports that his incoming White House chief of staff will be Mike Flynn, who also served as head of the Defence Intelligence Agency.

Unsubstantiated allegations say Russia has secret information about him. BBC NEWS

""We've just received *new and very interesting* information on Donald Trump right now which I would NOT have expected.""

They met each other on OKCupid.com and got married Dec. 31, 2012. A couple was allegedly caught in a sex sting with a 15-year-old girl they met on a dating site The sex sting happened last year after the alleged victim's father was alerted to sexually explicit messages about his daughter by another girl from another social media site.

He checked the girl's phone, where he discovered explicit details about the threesome and a video.

The man called police and tipped them off to the couple's hotel room at the West Springfield Red Carpet Inn, where the couple had booked a special jacuzzi room by using the dating site to advertise their ""gift,"" according to court documents.

She was sentenced to 10 years for manslaughter, but prosecutors have agreed to drop the second-degree murder charge. She did not speak during the hearing, other than to state her name. Lu was arrested in September 2012 after police found a bloodied piece of a man's body inside the shower of her family's home in Victoria, B.C., where she lived with her parents and was helping take care of them. Investigators believe she stabbed and decapitated her lover and hid the body in the shower in order to escape detection. Police allege that Lu killed Huang because she loved him but he didn't feel the same way about her, and in a recent application for bail, Lu wrote that she did not 'feel safe anywhere anymore, especially (police stations), that's why I left.' Court documents reveal that the suspect also suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder from her time as a Chinese domestic worker, as well as being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and depression.

Hyperlapse is a term for a motion picture or video that is made using a special technique of creating fast-moving sequences so they seem as if they were slowed down. The Verge explained that Hyperlapse makes a time lapse by stabilizing video so it is easier to play back in a way that the movements match the desired speed of movement. This allows for the video to smoothly glide along a path where it would appear as if it were captured in a single unbroken shot. Hyperlapse will give some of the features of Instagram’s photo sharing app, which could give a reason to upgrade. Hyperlapse has some similarities to time lapse technology available for iOS and Android apps alike. The iOS and Android apps are also free.

50691,3,"Background

Malaria is a disease caused by protists within the Plasmodium genus and transmitted to humans and other vertebrates by female anopheles mosquitoes. It is spread person-to-person by the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito, while the Plasmodium spirochete, the parasite which causes malaria, circulates in the blood. Malaria is an ancient disease of humans. It is estimated that malaria has been transmitted to humans since the end of the last ice age. Malaria transmission has resulted in human population migration across Eurasia, the Americas, and Africa. Malaria's origins are thought to be in east Africa.

Most malaria infections occur in tropical regions, such as Africa. Over the last half century, malaria has become endemic in much of sub-Saharan Africa, and is considered one of the deadliest infectious diseases in low income groups. It can severely impact a newborn's immune system, causing infant mortality and lifelong health disabilities.

The goal of Roll Back Malaria is to roll back malaria by 2040, meaning malaria prevalence in Africa will fall by 80%. The plan is based on four areas:

An estimated one in every five deaths of a child aged five to 14 years in children under five years. It is caused by a parasite which is transmitted to humans in the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. The disease most commonly affects children under five years of age in sub-Saharan Africa, where a large percentage of the world’s population lives. The disease can be prevented, and has virtually been eliminated from Western countries, where there is an effective vaccination against malaria. However, it is still endemic in Africa, where a few new strains emerge yearly. A vaccine against malaria is considered crucial to achieving global malaria elimination. However, because it is a relatively new medical technology, its cost is high compared with its potential benefits. The Roll Back Malaria Partnership has committed a substantial amount of funding to malaria research and anti-malarial treatments as a vital step toward eliminating the disease. It aims to raise $500 million over three years. The partnership, involving the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the World Health Organization, the U.S. Agency for International Development and various African malaria research institutions, is targeting 15-20 million malaria-"

The 111 system is being rushed into service, with many areas ill-prepared, the BMA says.
The introduction of the system has already been delayed by two years.
The Health Department has already sanctioned an extension of six months to the original 1 April 2013 deadline for regions struggling to set up the new service, Health Minister Lord Howe confirms.
But the BMA is concerned that many of the places that are already offering the new service or that are due to launch soon are ill-prepared, putting patients' lives at risk.
Many parts of the NHS England and NHS Improvement plan, submitted to Parliament in September last year, had already been withdrawn due to the poor planning and lack of resources.
NHS 111 will be the national telephone service, replacing current services such as NHS Direct.
At present, services vary from region to region, with some using the 0800 number NHS Direct for telephone triage, while others use 0845 4647.
The 111 system will be available to callers throughout the day and from all phones, including mobiles, by answering questions and providing advice – though the NHS insists this will not be limited to GPs."

Article: A 'health tsunami' as new NHS 111 telephone service hits major problems
By Kate Donaghy
15th February 2013, 3:07 pm GMT

The NHS Emergency medical helpline was expected to be the saviour for struggling callers in the 'Tsunami' year of 'The Great Slump'.
However, the new emergency telephone service, which has been piloted over the past year, has already been hit with a series of problems that have left people stuck on hold for hours, the Mail on Sunday can disclose.
A pilot of the new number was run in London, the West Midlands, Cheshire and Merseyside and parts of the North of England but the service has now been launched in hundreds of hospitals
Callers to the NHS 111 centre are assessed by a trained nurse or paramedic and then face an automated system that routes calls to the correct department.
There has been much optimism over the new telephone number since its introduction last October.
This was the plan to address the growing demands being made on the emergency treatment system and ease the pressure felt by ambulance crews.
However, the new scheme has already been the subject of much criticism with some health leaders saying it has"
45169,3,"``  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is ""sceptical"" about the quality of England's new ``emergency'' ``numbers service.''
The `Health Service Journal'' reports Mr Hunt saying the new system is proving to be ""much harder to deliver"" than initially planned.
In July the Department of Health said it wanted the service to be fully operational by April 2013.
'I have my doubts'
That deadline now appears to be in doubt, according to Mr Hunt.
""I have my doubts,"" he said in the Health Service Journal article, entitled `I have my doubts'`.
""We have still not signed up the number of ambulance trusts, out of a network of 108, that we want so that it's available, the NHS Direct line. And I'm sceptical about whether or not we can roll it out everywhere - in a way that won't leave people waiting for hours on end...

''I'm absolutely dead against any idea of rationing care, and I haven't put it in [the national health service] legislation because I'm not sure that we can legally do it,''' he said, in quotes reported in the Financial Times
The scheme was set up to replace the NHS direct phone line,"
45169,4,"The 111 service was intended to replace the current NHS Direct 0845 4647 telephone service.
It is intended to be open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  NHS Direct has been operating since April 1982, as the NHS Direct service; it replaced the national service of NHS Accident Advice Helpline.
Its purpose is to provide advice on things such as minor illness/injury, the NHS Direct '111' service is the NHS England's response to the 2008 NHS report ‘Citizens' health service’
The new service is provided free of charge, with an 'urgent care assessment' taking about ten minutes, and emergency care takes around 30-60 minutes.    If it is possible to treat the person at home, this is the preferred option  Patients who require further assessment will be called back for a longer, more comprehensive appointment.
The '111' service is available in a total of 19 counties and London,
The pilot areas were Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire, Devon and Cornwall, Dorset, East Sussex, Hengrove in the Vale of Glamorgan, Herefordshire, Kent, Mid Sussex, Northumberland, North Somerset, Portsmouth, Sefton, Surrey"

Rosetta Probe Images Comet From Above

September 02, 2014

For the first time in the history of the solar system, scientists have been able to watch a comet from above.

The European Space Agency, along with NASA, has launched its Rosetta probe towards 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. As of today, Rosetta has reached an altitude of 13.6 miles above the comet's surface.

During that time, the comet's surface will heat up significantly. The Rosetta probe will capture images of the comet as it heats up, and scientists will be able to track the formation of carbon dioxide ice layers as it cools; the probe will take a high resolution of the surface with three scientific instruments on board.

In addition to the probe itself, a Rosetta Orbiter will also be launched this year, which will watch the comet over the next seven years, and act as a communications relay between the Rosetta probe and the ground."

From the images, a team of scientists, led by Dr Holger Sierks of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Göttingen, Germany, has found evidence that the comet's surface is fragmented on scale-up to small hills up to 4 km high, and also revealed the presence of more than 400 large troughs, which may be related to fractures and cracks seen in comet surface features in recent years. The surface features correspond in depth to those seen in high-resolution images acquired in December 2005 by the Spaceborne Thermal Infrared Sensor-C (STIS).

Summary
First-innings hero Dom Bess proved he should be Somerset's most important player with the ball by taking a further four wickets to add to his eight in his debut first-class match.
Bess made a brilliant comeback from a poor start in his first over.
The spinner was the last player to be dismissed on day one, taking wickets at regular intervals to reduce Sussex to 60-8, and the Bears to 61-8 at lunch. After the break, in the company of Rikki Clarke, he dismissed his former team-mate Will Beer and Tom Bailey, with the scores still not adjusted.

82241,0,Stonewall helps footballers come out as gay. The only player to come out as gay before retirement...''    More to come...
82241,1,"Summary

Premier League footballer Thomas Hitzlsperger has been in the news again this week after a video from a few weeks ago surfaced where the former Aston Villa and West Ham United defender can be heard asking the camera, ""Do you think I'm gay?""

However, it is now clear that Hitzlsperger has not given up hope of coming out as gay and could be outed in the near future.

Hitzlsperger was the first player in Premier League history to come out after playing but he didn't know that at the time. He didn't know that he would be able to continue his career and, at the same time, still live as a gay man without fear.

As well as being the first Premier League player to come out while still playing, Hitzlsperger was also the first to come out publicly in Germany's top two divisions.

Coming out: Thomas Hitzlsperger came out during his time as an Aston Vila player. He has since retired from the game but hopes to give advice to other players wanting to come out. In March 2012 he came out in Germany's Bundesliga, although he retired some months later.

""For us now in 2012 things have become a lot easier but had I been a footballer today I doubt it would be easy,"" Hitzlsperger tells the Sunday Telegraph. ""There may not have been a problem with the fans but it would have been almost impossible to be gay during those days. It was hard for me when I was a footballer because I would not have had that ability to go back into the training ground and play a game without anyone mentioning it.

10298,3,"By. William A. Jacobson. November 28th, 2006. I will now take a quick detour from my review of Senator Obama's book, ''Independence Day.''  There is a case pending in court involving the Obama campaign and former White House counsel Gregory Craig. The case in question dates back to October 2000. But if you listen to Senator Obama's campaign spinners, you would never know there was an actual case. If you go by the spin, and you hear it on the media, you would think that Craig and the campaign itself were merely engaged with some petty disagreement back in 2000. In reality, the Obama campaign was caught engaging in some very shady activities. It was caught breaking federal laws. Craig and the campaign were engaged in a series of activities that included Craig's solicitation of a bribe from the head of a lobbying and public relations firm to get government documents he had in his possession.  So, what's all the fuss about? Well two things: The most important thing to understand is that the Obama campaign was engaged in some pretty shady activities. And the second most important thing to understand is that Senator Obama himself is being criminally investigated for some of the very same things he was involved in a decade ago.

According to a report by Bloomberg News dated Nov. 3, 2013,

""The government said in late October that it expected 6 million people to be enrolled by the end of this month under President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul. The goal was ambitious, given glitches with software for enrolling people in the online insurance marketplace. In the first two weeks of November, 744,000 people were signed up through the web site, according to a report the Department of Health and Human Services released Wednesday. Thirty-six states are relying on HealthCare.gov to process all their enrollments, though 14 states and Washington, D.C., have their own exchanges. Enrollments through the federal marketplace are averaging 5,267 per day and total 106,185. The number represents only 1.5 percent of the 7 million the system is expected to attract by the end of March to take in enough revenue to pay for its expected financial outlays, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Enrollments through state-based exchanges average about 3,723 per day, making good on what has been a slow but steady march to meeting what's expected to be another year of record expenses.

Starring Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role, along with Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, and Joel Edgerton, the film had been slated to open on Christmas day this year. No specific new date was indicated. In announcing the change, Warner Bros. president of distribution Dan Fellman lauded Luhrmann's singular visual style. ""We think moviegoers of all ages are going to embrace it, and it makes sense to ensure this unique film reaches the largest audience possible,"" he said in a statement. International distribution chief Veronika Kwan Vanderberg added that the studio believes ""The Great Gatsby"" ""will be the perfect summer movie around the world.''."

Baz (The Gatsby) Luhrman's film, which stars Leonardo DiCaprio in the role Tom Buchanan, who is in reality a rich playboy living in pre-war America, with a flair for making enemies, had been scheduled for the holiday season this year, but Warner Bros. has moved the film's release date to next year. At the moment, they haven't announced a new date, but a press release did not indicate any new opening in mind. The film has been directed by one of America's most promising directors of the past decades, Baz Luhrmann ( Romeo and Juliet ). His previous film, Australia, is considered one of the greatest films of the 21st century, and his next film, The Great Gatsby has a star-studded cast and a lavish budget to match. This is not to talk about the visual effects of the film, though!, because there's no release date for this movie yet, so stay tuned."

It is also, perhaps, the greatest literary novel ever written-- a novel in which the quest for the American dream is both the quest for self-identity, and also the search for a love that will give it purpose. Set among the glittering elites of Long Island and New York, across the span of a single summer in the mid-1920s, ""The Great Gatsby"" is F. Scott Fitzgerald's dazzling portrait of two flawed lives colliding in a tale of high social ambition and the ruthless pursuit of material success. Long before the age of email and texting, a love affair, even a friendship, was often mediated through the medium of handwritten letters; these letters became the catalyst for Fitzgerald to transform a friendship into a sweeping epic romance.The Great Gatsby""   (Source: IMDb)."

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jay Gatsby, an extravagant Long Island millionaire and social climber in the Jazz Age, whose world is in disarray upon his lover's death. Carey Mulligan plays his devious, mysterious new wife, Myrtle, also in a state of grief and collapse.  Tobey Maguire plays Gatsby's former friend, Tom Buchanan, and Joel Edgerton plays Gatsby's jealous, obsessive cousin, Nick Carraway.

The story was adapted into a stage musical in 1974 with David Hemmings in the title role. The first film version, with Robert Redford directed by Richard Brooks, was released in 1974. In 2005, Baz Luhrmann was signed to produce a new version and then direct a live-action film, which was later cancelled for unknown reasons and replaced by the 3-D version (now delayed).

A report on suicide in Wales says there has been an alarming rise in suicide rates for older men over the past 10 years, with those in the 40-to-49 age bracket the most susceptible

However, the report released today by the charity Mind Cymru also says many men still do not receive the support and medical guidance they need.

It shows that one in four people under 50 are clinically suicidal.
But by the time they reach age 50, almost a quarter of the male population is affected.
The charity’s manager for influence and change Ruth Coombs said older men were more prone to suicide, but many did not receive the support and medical guidance they needed.

```I think older men aren’t necessarily getting on the radar because they’re more invisible when it comes to the mental health system in Wales.
```And also I think it can be that the way an older man presents themselves in the community is not necessarily consistent with the way an older woman does.
```For example, I think if you were to walk down the street and see an older man in his 70s or 80s wearing his dressing gown you might not think anything of it"

Mentally ill Welsh pensioners at heightened suicide risk - BBC News

More info :
This news item is about the latest risk factor for suicide.  Mental Illness is  one of the risk factors for suicide.  The BBC have provided a good summary.  In brief, mentally ill can be any illness (mental or physical) that causes someone to be more or less in this life, in distress or in a bad or unhappy state, so:
 1 - This may be any illness that is likely to cause distress or unhappiness (a symptom)
 2 - It may be a symptom of something worse such as depression in someone else, physical illness in a family member or of undiagnosed mental illness in someone or of undiagnosed medical illness (for the person) in anyone
 3 - It may be a symptom of a mental illness (this is the risk factor)
 4 - It may be a symptom of an unknown mental illness or disease
 5 - It may be a symptom of a physical condition that causes distress but does not cause death (for example cancer)

A U.S. military strike killed Abu Hasee's wife at an ISIS command center in Mosul on Tuesday, the first known American operation directly targeting the woman who, along with her husband, commanded a terrorist group that slaughtered thousands across Iraq and Syria. Maj. Mariam A. Al Mansouri's role as wife and mother gave her a certain mystique, but U.S. military officials say her connection to Abu Sayyaf, the leader of an Islamic militant group that once pledged loyalty to Osama bin Laden, is what drove Abu Hasee the suicide bomber and led to Al Mansouri's death on Tuesday. While the strike in Iraq does not definitively confirm that Al Mansouri was in direct contact with Abu Sayyaf or his operatives, U.S. officials told NBC News that while Al Mansouri might not have been a terrorist herself, she gave support and cover to Sayyaf by supporting his terror network. ""She was doing that in a very personal, hands-on way,"" an official said. After marrying Abu Hasee, Al Mansouri was in many ways a typical member of ISIS' all-female cell"

A young-adjudged-to be-mad man has admitted to fatally stabbing a man in an Adelaide park as the man's girlfriend stood nearby – in an attack that police believe started over a girl. Joshua William Lomas, 21, pleaded guilty this morning in the District Court to the murder of Luke Coburn. Mr Lomas is accused of killing Mr Coburn just after midnight on January 27 last year by stabbing him multiple times in the head and torso on a lawn outside his mother's house in Torrens Park, Mount Barker. Mr Coburn had been at a nearby bar with a group of friends when police say Lomas approached them and asked for the man’s cellphone number. He then stabbed Mr Coburn as the man was telling his group ""f**k off"" to Lomas. Mr Coburn staggered into his mother's house in a distressed state and was later pronounced dead at the Royal Adelaide Hospital's burns unit.

The BBC is reporting a major new story. If it is confirmed, it will be the biggest story to emerge about Welsh health since the damning review of patient safety at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd Hospital's Tawel Fan Unit published last week.

The head of the Welsh Assembly, Peter Hain, has confirmed that the government’s intervention in Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) will be made over the concerns expressed in the report into Tawel Fan.

""The findings were very concerning indeed,"" he said. ""The whole area is under our direct oversight.""

On Tuesday, Health Minister Mark Drakeford announced that BCUHB would be placed in special measures by the Welsh government, as it had no ""clear evidence of sufficient improvement"" while in ""special measures"".

The move will put direct Welsh government control of BCUHB under his health department, under the management of Dr Andrew Goodall, whose resignation as Interim Chief Executive has also been accepted.

The government’s move has taken a whole political debate about health in Wales on to centre stage. ""Welsh Ministers will"

Slovak star Sagan: I'm leaving Tinkov team for Bora
By Mark Middleton
Aug 25 (Reuters) - Peter Sagan, a five-times winner in the Tour de France and five-times world time-trial champion, said on Tuesday that he would leave Tinkoff-Saxo and move to German outfit Bora-Hansgrohe starting this season.
The move will end Sagan's association with Russian billionaire owner Oleg Tinkov and the Tinkoff-Saxo Group.
Tinkov announced last month that the team would cease operations and go into liquidation at the end of the season.
The 26-year-old Slovakian said there was no bitterness on his part.
""I did want to continue with the team but the conditions have changed,"" he told reporters at a news conference.
""The Tinkoff team, like any company, must grow or die. I had to think about the future.""

The researchers also suggest potential causes, such as hormones, inflammation and insulin levels, in how the disease begins and spreads. In a separate study published today in Cancer Prevention Research, investigators found that obese patients who are overweight tend to do worse than thin patients because they’re less likely to be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and are more likely to die from the disease. “Physiologically, obese patients have a worse metabolism, so their fat is released at a faster rate,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. Jie Zhang, a radiologist and medical director at the Texas Center for Cancer Research. “"

Resident Phillip Ord said: ""The bishop won't come clean and say who is going to take the final decision... I'm not very optimistic about it.""

Published: August 11, 2003,  in The New York Times by Steven Brill

It is commonly assumed that we can predict most, if not all, known causes of cancer -- that with enough study and money (or as much screening as we wish) we can develop ways to prevent cancer.

We certainly think that we can figure out a way to identify cancer cells before they metastasize, and possibly even before they become visible to the naked eye.

There have been a few spectacular failures in the past decade -- one cell culture technique for making cancer cells proved to be useless, another was found to kill healthy cells instead of cancer cells.

There have also been a few spectacular successes, which made a small but appreciable difference in a limited set of cases.

For the most part, the science of prediction is still in its infancy and the field is in need of both serious funding and rigorous scientific research.

Here are a few reasons why we think it is unlikely that we can figure out a way to predict cancer, even if we wanted to:

Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said all parts of Wales saw major investments.
On Tuesday, Labour AM Lee Waters warned against ""pork barrel"" budget deals that include bypass projects.
The final Welsh budget for 2017/18 includes £50m for a bypass at Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire.
Mr Price, who represents the town as AM for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, said Welsh Government capital spending in mid and west Wales over four years was half the figure for south east Wales of more than £1,000 per head.
""Next year it is projected to fall to 29% - nothing can justify that level of gap,"" Mr Price said, during finance questions in the Senedd on Wednesday.
""We heard in the chamber yesterday, I would say a rather sneering tone of metropolitan provincialism attacking my party for at least trying to get some concession, some investment, in the regions and the constituencies that we represent."

Others, like Giustina, pay in installments, often for as long as five years.''.

 Medical Tourism: A Surprising Trend in Global Health Care by Stephanie Strom, The New York Times, April 3, 2009"
96493,1,"Medical tourism will continue to grow, though not as rapidly as it has in the past few years. The reason for this will largely be the recession that has been experienced over the past couple of years. However, people can`t afford to sit idly by and do nothing about their health care when they can save money by visiting a cheaper hospital in another country. Medical tourists should keep checking their insurance plan to make sure that they will have adequate coverage. Make sure that you are completely informed about what you are doing if you choose to go elsewhere. This means that you want to make sure that you are checking out every aspect of the situation. When you`ve gone through all of the necessary steps necessary, like choosing an acceptable hospital with a reputable doctor, you can then relax and let Planet Hospital handle the rest. When dealing with medical tourists, you will be meeting them in their culture. Please respect their culture and try not to make them do something inappropriate. You will need to stay on the good side of the locals. Finally, you will need to work out a system that suits everyone. Your hospital should have facilities to handle their patients who have traveled to you for surgery. Your hospital should also have security, which should have the task of protecting you at all costs."

.  A dog reported missing two years ago has been rescued by fishermen who spotted it swimming off the Florida coast. The dog was wearing a collar with the name Baby on it when she was found two miles off Tampa at 7.30am on Thursday morning last week. A microchip led vets to a report showing the dog had first been reported missing two years ago and that her owner had died a couple of months ago. Overboard: Baby the dog with her new owner Kathy Klein, who adopted her after the dog was found two miles out to sea. Mystery:  The dog was wearing a collar with the name Baby on it and had been microchipped. Baby, who appeared groomed and well-cared for, was spotted by the crew of a commercial fishing vessel, who could just make her out in the water.

Jacksonville police told NBC affiliate WTLV that the dog washed up at Beach Boulevard near Bay Street at 10:30 a.m. and has not been positively identified. Police are investigating, WTLV reports, but so far nothing indicates the dog was attacked by a shark. Police say the dog is not chipped and they don't know who the dog belongs to. Some friends of the dog's owner had gone to the beach to swim and were out on the water for a few hours before finding out the dog wasn't on land and that it was lost. When they did find out, the friends said they tried contacting the owner's cousin, but he did not answer his phone. Officials are asking anyone who may have information on the dog to call the Jacksonville Police Department at 904-630-0500. NBC News has reached out to the department and will update if we hear back.

I agree with a different color for main text, bold face, etc. Just so it is easier to read.

I think a boldface-type font can be very useful for reading - on the web site, for example.

Maybe I'm not the right person to take on this kind of project, but if it means anything I think the font you're using is rather hard to read and needs to be made more readable from afar (although I can see the effort you've put into this so I guess there is that).

Workers rescued

The miners had been stuck in the underground passageway of the coal mine in the north-eastern province of Liaoning since Friday.

The fire had started at about 07:00 local time (23:00 GMT Friday).

Liaoning Fuxin's chairman, Li Jun, said rescuers had to take the long road to reach the miners after having to cut a path through the debris blocking the entrance to the mine.

In the space of about 24 hours, he said, the miners were brought to the surface.

The 23 rescued miners were taken to hospitals, where their conditions were reported to be ''stable''.

The cause of the fire is not yet clear, but the company said that the rescue operation had now ended.

  Gerry's reflections of an Londonderry that had been bombarded by the Luftwaffe, occupied by the British forces and then the army and then the civil rights movements. Gerry's film tells Londonderry's story through the eyes of those who witnessed and lived through those events. **Social movements evolve:
  Gerry says: ""Londonderry was the birthplace of the social movements, of that I have no doubt."" He talks about those events in terms of ""the creation of spaces where people could speak and be heard"". ***Londonderry's political history is told:

It has been shown at film festivals around the world, and was screened in Belfast for the first time earlier this year.

The body of a baby found dumped at the side of a country road was that of a girl, police confirmed today.

Officers were called to Ox Hey Lane in Lostock, Bolton, shortly before 4.55pm on Thursday after the body was discovered by a man and woman out walking their dog.

The body was wrapped in clothing and plastic bags, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said.

Investigation: Police forensic officers search the undergrowth on Ox Hey Lane in Bolton after the body of a newborn baby was discovered found dead and abandoned.

The body was covered in plastic bags and was found dumped at the side of the road.

A cordon has been set up around a path where the child was found, close to fields used by Bolton Wanderers' academy players, and officers also recovered a note which requested that the baby receive an Islamic burial.

A post mortem examination has been carried out and the cause of death remains unascertained.

  ABC News anchor Amy Robach has announced her plans to undergo chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer. According to Deadline, Robach opened up about her health via social media and explained that she was diagnosed with cancer following an on-air mammogram. The news anchor is also revealing news of her diagnosis days after she said that she wasn't planning on returning to GMA as co-anchor. Robach said she felt as though she was letting down her fans and viewers upon learning of her diagnosis, which included a double mastectomy last fall.

  Implications
  While Robach plans to undergo chemotherapy to treat her illness, the treatment doesn't appear detrimental to the remainder of her life. According to the American Cancer Society, chemotherapy is used to treat cancer that is not in remission or has come back. The treatment can be administered in several different ways depending on the type of cancer, its stage, and the patient's response to previously received treatment. Chemotherapy therapy can occur in a number of different ways, including intravenous infusions, oral medications, and drugs administered through an implant in the skin.

It will make it a federal crime if the federal government can prove that the victim was attacked because of those specific identity characteristics. For states and local governments to use federal funds to prosecute a hate crime, there must be an underlying federal crime. There is a separate provision in this legislation that gives jurisdictions more flexibility to tailor their state laws, so that they can add any type of identity or characteristics that are relevant to crime that they want to prosecute as a hate crime. The existing federal hate crime law says that if you’re charged with a hate crime, a hate crime would make you eligible for a longer sentencing.

The DSM doesn't, however, list Asperger's as a specific diagnosis, but instead suggests that it be used when a medical diagnosis might be appropriate. However, many have claimed that Asperger's was recognized as a distinct disorder in 1962, when Dr. Hans Asperger coined the name of the condition. Wikipedia provides a list of claims for the name's history, which it seems like a pretty tenuous justification for the ruling. A more plausible explanation is that the judge didn't believe Beckman's account that Asperger's wasn't a pre-existing condition when it was a new development later in his life.

Jason Beckman, 21, has been found guilty in the killing of Jay Beckman on April 7, 2009. The victim, who served on the South Miami City Commission at the time of his death, had made statements about Fox following the death of his beloved dog -- Fox was a frequent target of the victim's jocular remarks. It was then that Jason reportedly decided that he would kill his father. The Miami Herald reports from court that prosecutors presented six witnesses to prove Jason's guilt, including Nastanee Beckman, who found the body in April, and another inmate, Michael Nistal. The inmate said Jason, who said at an earlier hearing that he was ""just trying to stop it"", had spoken of a plan to kill the victim months before the shooting. According to Nistal, which appears to have been a major point of the argument against the young man: ''I never had a chance to tell him that the Megan Fox joke was never funny,''."

The article talks about a monastic community in the heart of the city, not a Benedictine monastery, so it may be less stifling than a monastery run by one of the old-school orders.
But, of course, that will depend on the personality of the prioress who's chosen to run the community.
Monastic life is full of frustrations and difficulties if you don't have a good, understanding head.

A Benedictine monastery in Ireland started from this sort of idea - and ended up turning into a modern boarding school that's as strict as the one next door.

I think it will go ok, if they get someone who has the discipline for it at least. It's much less likely to get people upset if there isn't a strict rule. I don't really see this as anything very modern or new. Even a lot of monastic communities aren't terribly strict - I've worked at both types and the same amount of stress comes in both cases."

The entire heart-stopping incident, which occurred at about 11:45am in Maroochydore at the Sunshine Coast on Thursday, was captured on the dash camera of a tow truck driven by local Murray Lowns. Footage from the dash-cam shows a silver Holden Astra, that was driving behind the truck, changing lanes while driving at a high speed on the Sunshine Motorway.

He'd likely not get as long as Hamilton did from Mercedes though. At this stage I think it's too early to tell.

The point is that his career could have been quite different at Mercedes.

Virginia health officials are investigating a tuberculosis outbreak at Robert E. Lee High School in Fairfax County, Virginia.

Two additional people contracted tuberculosis last month, and the investigation is ongoing, they say.

The three students who contracted the disease were treated and have since been cleared, health officials say.

“We are reaching out to anyone who may have been exposed,” said a spokeswoman for the county health department.

School officials say that the new tuberculosis patients and people who may have been exposed during the school year have remained on campus and remain under a watch of health officials, who monitor for symptoms of the disease that is spread by inhaling airborne droplets.

The school has been closed on Tuesday following the diagnoses.

Tuberculosis is the deadliest infectious disease in the world and it is most often spread through people who have latent tuberculosis and do not have symptoms.

The bacteria also spreads through close contact with an infected person.

Symptoms of active tuberculosis include coughing, fatigue, weight loss, and shortness of breath.

Of the many, many schools that Fairfax County, Virginia, has, there’s one that had three cases of tuberculosis in their very recent past.  The discovery of TB isn’t all that surprising in Fairfax, although it is shocking to me that it wasn’t caught earlier, or wasn’t caught at all.  I mean, this isn’t some poor backwater, red state kind of place.  Fairfax is one of the most prosperous, well-connected, politically progressive, blue-leaning places in the US and that means that it should have a much better public health record and I find it deeply disturbing that as much as I live in here it had so many cases of this thing and the whole outbreak took nearly a year and half to get uncovered."

Luxottica-Essilor merger could create behemoth
By Christopher Auld For The Daily Telegraph, London
Published: March 31, 2015 02:34 PM GMT

The proposed merger of Ray-Ban maker Essilor with Italian eyeglass designer Leonardo Del Vecchio's Luxottica could create the world's largest spectacles maker.
The pair, who were previously reported to be in discussions about a deal, are close to agreeing on a tie-up, said people briefed on the negotiations.
The size of the new company is not yet decided but Mr Del Vecchio has indicated he wanted the group to be roughly the size of the market leader L'Oreal, said two of the people briefed on the talks.
L'Oréal is slightly ahead of Nestle of Switzerland, which has a market weighting of about 6.4 per cent.

60256,2,"The study

The researchers used a harmless strain of the gorilla-coronavirus, named G4BP-ZEBOV, to test the vaccine. It was given along with an anti-viral drug.
Within the first 10 days after having the vaccine, the animals' blood samples showed a strong immune response. This was followed by a lower antibody response for seven weeks, which the researchers saw as a sign that it could be used as a regular vaccine.
The chimpanzee's body also produced a protein called interferon -which is also released by the human body when it detects a virus in the body.
""It's encouraging that the response is so high,"" said Dr Walsh.
""This means we can vaccinate wild animals to protect them from infection by this deadly virus.""
But researchers say that such a process for vaccinating wild gorillas could be a lengthy one: ""If you want to vaccinate 1,000-10,000 gorillas you've looking at vaccinating them over a 40-50 year timeline.  That's a long time for something that is probably a yearly epidemic.""

We have developed a 100% effective Ebola vaccine for human use, and this is exactly the same as the one used on chimpanzees. After a previous experimental Ebola vaccine, we showed that it could be safely and effectively given to captive chimpanzees using the very same techniques as with humans, with no obvious problems. However, there is still more work to do to perfect both the vaccine and the techniques used for testing it before we have the luxury of using it in wild populations.""

What is now known
What is now known is that the vaccine is successful in protecting the chimps from the virus, which, so far, has shown no signs of developing resistance.
Vaccines are designed to mimic natural infection and the vaccine works on two lines of defense: antibodies that neutralize the virus and the T cell response, which identifies the Ebola virus and helps to kill it once it infects the body.
Although the chimpanzee study only tested a single dose, the scientists say that it was effective in the long term (a typical Ebola infection tends to last from 2-12 weeks).

Wasps’ 48-16 victory in front of a record crowd at the Ricoh Arena on Saturday saw Andy Goode set a new Premiership points tally as a Wasps player, bettering a London Irish record that had stood for 21 years. The 34-year-old fly half, who was born in Coventry and attended the city’s King Henry VIII school, produced a superb display to collect eight penalties, two conversions and a second half try that brought him 33 points — one better than the previous best shared by Niall Woods (London Irish, 1998), Dave Walder (Newcastle, 2000) and Tim Stimpson (Leicester, 2002). Goode said: “It sounds a bit cheesy but that’s what dreams are made of. I didn’t sleep that well last night. “I’ve been up here a fair few times to watch Coventry City play but to run out on the field was unbelievable. I got a hammering from my little girl for missing five kicks last week (against Castres). She made me change my boots and everything. “As I came off the field she was there and she said, “"

Goode was having a field day, having already landed six penalties - despite missing one - while fly half Christian Wade was a menace on the wing. In the sixth minute, the Coventry-born flyer cut back inside the field of play and burst through the defence before placing the ball through the uprights where it dribbled across the try-line. Three minutes earlier, as the visitors prepared themselves for a scrum at a ruck, the Wasps fly half and England skipper was on the offensive, taking an impressive catch and scoring under the posts. In the 10th minute, Coventry-born winger Christian Wade cut back inside and burst past the defence before placing the ball through the uprights where it dribbled across the try-line. Three minutes later, at another ruck, after Exiles prop Geoff Cross had momentarily threatened to spoil Wasps’ party, Goode took an impressive catch and scored under the posts.

This seems like a logical and sensible outcome, but I am sure that it is not the result that people expect, and that the result of the trial would have been a conviction and a longer sentence.

The point is that a plea deal would be more beneficial for Bieber than the trial and sentence, which would have been far harsher on him and the image of the criminal justice system. I think that there is very little that we will ever know about what exactly happened that night, and we can all have our own opinion about what may or may not have happened. The fact that there was a plea deal in the first place, and that it was accepted by the prosecutor, leads me to believe that in my opinion that Justin Bieber will remain a free man.

The deal to bring Premiership clubs into the competition - from next April's campaign - will see television income rise substantially. Premiership sides have seen their income drop in the past two seasons. In the last season Premiership clubs received around £17million from the tournament despite having made the final or semi-finals in seven of the 12 seasons since the competition started.

Bruce Craig, one of the English co-organisers of the tournament (after BT Sport and Sky Sports, a group of companies who collectively hold broadcasting rights in England), said: 'Our objective now is to make the clubs happy, and the way we can demonstrate that is by putting as much money back into the competition as we can.'

Title: NSCDC arrests four policemen suspected of gang rapes and torture in Ebonyi State

Author:. Ikechukwu Odu. The Nigeria Police Force has arrested four policemen who allegedly raped and tortured women in Ebonyi State to extort money. In Lagos this week to represent the Inspector General of Police at a memorial meeting in honour of a retired inspector-general of police, Odu, the national public relations officer of the NSCDC, Aliyu Adisa, said the men of Ogoja Area Command of the force, Edda Elemi and Obinna Nsofor, were arrested on August 18 for allegedly detaining three women, raped by them, in a bush and torturing them. Adisa said Elemi was arrested after one of the women escaped from the men’s captivity. “The accused policemen were caught in the act when one of the three women ran away from their custody on"

Comment: Great news. Steven Gerrard needs to be encouraged, not undermined with criticism at the World Cup, no matter what level - just look at Wayne Rooney at the Olympics, a great athlete (well, was...) and at times looked like he couldn't get his head round the fact he had been left out of the Football Association team of the year.

Comment: Brilliant. It's about time England players were made subject to a proper assessment of their character. I'm sure Steve Peters is the man for the job and that he will prove to be a most welcome addition to the England management set up. I really would, too, love to see Luke Shaw on the pitch. Great to see Wayne Rooney playing up front again, but what a goal that was, and an even better save. Great to see Phil Jones and Michael Carrick back out there as well. Great stuff, team selection, tactics and, of course, an excellent performance from England. Onwards and upwards. Well done, Roy.

Comment: Steven Gerrard is just the old Steven Gerrard! The same old dogmatic and stubbornly dogmatic approach on how things should be run in football, and a complete failure to listen to his team"

53282,1,"On October 27, 2005, three-quarters of a million people lined up outside New York's Madison Square Garden for a YouTube Symphony Orchestra concert''.

The New York Times reports that only about 7,000 people attended the concert which may have been sold out, based on the news reports and the concert program.

YouTube Symphony Orchestra is an open YouTube orchestra, with an international membership of almost 100 musicians.  Its website indicates that the orchestra is to perform in October 2005 and 2006 in New York City.  The Times adds that there are no live performances scheduled for later dates, other than the three concerts already scheduled for 2006.

The article provides other information, including the names of the YouTube Symphony Orchestra members, and the dates of their YouTube premiere.

53282,2,"A few minutes into the YouTube Symphony Orchestra concert at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday (Dec. 12), the audience was entranced by a live rendition of an 18th-century French waltz, the song ``Roses,'' by Canadian soprano Celine Dion.
 The soprano’s sweet, breathy voice was heard along with a video of her performing. On the screen an almost microscopic snippet of the lyrics, ``You have stolen my heart'' appeared. The music became more intense and the clip got faster and the song became very emotional. Then it cut to the soprano, sitting alone on a couch, singing in French, her eyes looking lovingly toward the camera. Afterward, the audience applauded and Dion smiled in response. Then it ended.

53282,3,"New York, NY, October 9, 2001 (CIDRAP News) –
     A symphony orchestra performed one of today's most popular music
videos alongside famous names in classical music.

The group's unusual performance of a YouTube compilation of music
videos and an orchestral suite by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ended New
York's YouTube Symphony Orchestra's first major public concert.

```We are at the forefront of something quite revolutionary,''
Orchestra music director Christopher Bales told a half-full
New York's Town Hall, which had just over 700 seats for its last
night on the Town Hall's main stage.

The YouTube Symphony Orchestra is the latest incarnation of what
sounds like a crazy idea. The symphony orchestra is a 200-year-old
staple of the classical music industry, in part because it performs
pieces written way back when that require full production -- and full
orchestra--musicians. To have 100 musicians play music that anyone can
view on their computer is a ```huge risk,'' the composer said.

Leeds United Supporters’ Trust (LUST) have said the Football League (EFL) has failed to prove a case against them and has resorted to taking the matter to court.

The latest news is that Cellino's son and Cagliari will loan Federico only if a buyer can be found for Leeds in January. I have heard that the Leeds board is confident that they can make good on the loan terms in December, because the loan is contingent on the Cellino's son being transfered to a club with adequate finances to pay for him. I have heard that Cellino's son could be loaned for as long as 6 months and the conditions might include paying a fee of between 5 and 8 million pounds. The loan will be made to Cagliari, but they will not pay anything more than that. Cagliari have told Leeds that if they are not paying off any more than that, they will take the player back by December 1st.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Facebook Inc. is considering a new ad format that would show some information and other ads on the phone's display, potentially a significant step forward in the Internet company's effort to diversify its business beyond the booming U.S. market. Facebook is researching 'push' notifications that could appear at the top of the phone's lock screen and offer information like news articles, sports scores and movie previews, all delivered by the social network without the need for a user to open an application first, company spokesman Mark Jorgensen said. The notification may also include a link to open the application. Jorgensen didn't have details about the ad format, saying that discussions are just starting. The company is considering several options, including one in which users can open the application and others where they have to actively seek it out, he said. Push notifications could be attractive to businesses looking to get messages out quickly, such as airlines, movie studios and companies selling concert tickets, Jorgensen said. But the messages also could generate more revenue for Facebook than traditional banner or video ads. That's because ads for third"

The United States’ Nuclear Doctrine in the Present

The Nuclear Policy Act is a key nuclear disarmament treaty that is of the “three-chained” type: in contrast to the two-chained treaties (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)) and the one-chained treaties (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT)), it is the third part of a triad.

The key was calories, but the calories came from whole organic foods, not shakes.''
I've been trying really hard not to link these up, but in the interests of the open exchange of ideas, I've posted this.

I find the calorie-counting stuff to be a bit too much like the calorie-counting diets from the 70's and 80's.

In the last ten years, we've learned that the key to losing weight, and keeping it off, is not how many calories they take in, it's how much they burn in a day.

What most people are missing is this : you have to do a minimum of 4 hours of exercise per week. That's the only way your body will burn off the excess calories, and even then it's difficult.

50029,2,"A 19-year-old college student died of head injuries while participating in a hazing ritual for a New York campus fraternity, the coroner ruled Thursday, raising questions about the risk of injury. Chun ""Michael"" Deng, a freshman at the Baruch College Center in Downtown Manhattan, was blindfolded, weighted down with sandbags and forced to crawl across a muddy landscape for the ritual for Pi Delta Psi, a student-run fraternity, which is based in Philadelphia. When fraternity officials learned of Mr. Deng's death in December, they tried to cover it up, the authorities say. The medical examiner's announcement came a week after the coroner's office gave its finding to the district attorney's office, which had been conducting a criminal investigation, the authorities said. ``My heart breaks for Chun Michael and his family,'' New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said Thursday. ""We must work to ensure that nobody loses their life in school in any circumstance -- but more importantly, we must act swiftly and decisively,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement. In an investigation last month, CNN and The Philadelphia Inquirer found that the fraternity had a history of hazing incidents and was accused of lying to Baruch College about the nature of the ritual.

Hazing

Hazing is a form of bullying in which the purpose is to humiliate, manipulate, or subject another person to risk, physical or psychological. Hazing is typically applied to the initiation or recruitment of a new member or to a pledge of an existing (fraternity/sorority/club). The act may be directed towards a recruit's mental or physical well-being.

History
Hazing first appeared in North America in the early 1800s while in England it had entered college life as early as the 1200s. Hazing in North America began around 1810 when fraternities began demanding ritualized participation. Around 1906, hazing was reported in all American colleges and universities.

Ritualized hazing is also used in military organizations. Ritualized hazing occurs most prevalently in Army infantry combat arms; the Navy's E-3 and E-4 (corpsmen) and the Marine Corps' 0(c) corps (recreational therapists).

In the 1990s several American fraternities and sororities were involved in hazing death cases.

Hazing is often illegal in both the United States and Canada for students of higher learning, such as colleges and universities"

That's a lot of information and it won't make it easy for a search engine.
Is it too much? Why is it not being mentioned or cited as usual in any of the news articles in newspapers, TV or online about this, e.g.?
Was there any discussion about this case in the media in the days leading up to the official press release? Not to mention that the news coverage was often, but far from uniformly, focused on the actions of fraternities rather than frat hazing. We don't normally see an outpouring of grief by news outlets of this sort in the cases of frat deaths which are not related to hazing.
So why no mention of this, unless it's just been dropped?
The NY Times article also references ""choking to death"". The Coroner's Office has not mentioned any such cause of death in this case"

Germany's DFB governing body yesterday denied the claims.
The DFB said documents were seized during the raids and that it was fully co-operating with the investigation.
About 50 officers and tax inspectors swooped in on the DFB headquarters and the homes of the three senior officials.
A spokesman said: ""In this matter, we are being dealt with as a state body in co-operation with the investigating body.""
""The investigation itself is being conducted according to our statutes and by our own internal laws and regulations. We expect that the competent state body will now proceed to the conclusion of this case.""

More recently, India also set a world record in the number of people for a kite-flying event in Allahabad by over 1,20,000 people. Indian students were also successful in breaking a world record for the highest number of synchronized swimming students in a pool.

It was this year that the Indian Railways launched the world's longest train, a diesel-powered train that stretches 584 kilometres from the western city of Ratlam to the northern Indian city of Patna. The previous world record for the longest train was set by a Japanese company in 2007 with a train that stretched 583 kilometres from Ueno to Tokyo. The Indian Railways train is not electric powered as it runs through a rough terrain and crosses a number of rivers.

Another example is the world's largest statue of a cat, also in India. The statue was dedicated to the cat 'Sagarika', who was known for his love of humans.

Another record that India broke is in the most people at a computer simultaneously using the Internet. In 2009, India beat the previous record by over 200,"

45403,2,"Newt Gingrich has made a name for himself on the presidential campaign trail as a tough candidate who won’t let much phase him. But the former House Speaker choked up and wiped away tears while recalling his late mother's struggle with depression and bipolar disease. He told mothers in Des Moines, Iowa, his focus on brain science issues stems from ‘dealing with the real problems of real people in my family’. But he didn’t explain why that focus should outweigh his other political stances. Mr Gingrich also called Sen. Chuck Grassley's comments about him in an interview with the Des Moines Register ‘an affront to the Iowa caucuses’. Mr Grassley said Mr Gingrich should stick to policy issues, not personal ones. Mr Gingrich is set to attend events in Des Moines on Sunday, but his spokesman says he is not scheduled to address the GOP's straw poll there. Iowa is usually a good indicator the shape of a Republican's campaign and recent polling in Iowa has shown Mr Romney pulling away once again. Video courtesy of ABC News.

Bush says, ""Afghanistan is not a state, which means that it is not governed. The Taliban are a state, which means they are subject to the laws, institutions and obligations of statehood, which includes upholding the rights of their citizens.''```

For those that care, a nice summary of the case: the defense argued that the alleged victims had made false allegations of abuse to garner attention and money. The jury, however, disregarded that opinion and found the defendants guilty of abuse.

The NFL players that bullied Martin have not been suspended or fined for the bullying or their racist and sexist ""jokes"" or behavior. Since, however, a few players on one team (the Miami Dolphins) have had disciplinary issues, the NFL may come down on players (probably most likely Richie Incognito and Jonathan Martin) very harshly. The reason being that the NFL is a private institution with most players (the players association being the exception) as employees.

82321,3,"* * * * * * Article by Martin Poole in Sports Mail on Sunday, 25 Jun 2006. The WTA's top flight of women's tennis is at war over a naked female tennis star's controversial appearance on the cover of the latest issue of ESPN magazine. The World Trade Association released a statement in which the WTA insisted that WTA members were expected to ""exhibit good decorum"", but that the matter was outside of the organisation's control because ""the decision about whether to endorse a product lies with the sponsors"". Tennis is not the only female sport to be embroiled in a morality row. In 2005, the Tour de France, the world's most prestigious cycling race, took flak when the winner Greg LeMond went around the route on a motorised bicycle with his shirt open at the waist. * * * * * * * * * The issue in its current form -- the Women's Tennis Association (WTA)'s Women in Tennis Yearbook -- goes on sale on July 3.

Mrs Foster was re-elected at Stormont Castle on Saturday night with 38 first preference votes - a majority of 29 ahead of Sinn Féin's Michelle O'Neill on 25 votes.

Sinn Féin remains the largest party overall, with 28 seats (up two).

The Ulster Unionist Party lost two seats, to 16.

Meanwhile, the Ulster Democratic Party has one seat, down one.

The Alliance has eight seats with the SDLP on 12.

Sinn Féin still has a majority of 28 in Northern Ireland's devolved assembly, after the first count.

It was a similar result at the previous assembly election four years ago, when the DUP took 37 seats and Sinn Féin 33.

The SDLP held 16 seats at that time, five more than the Alliance Party and two of the Ulster Unionist Party.

After the largest political party in Northern Ireland agreed to sit down with its one-time political rivals, the Irish Nationalists are insisting the talks must be ""based on real progress"" and be ""serious, substantive and open"".

The DUP leader Arlene Foster announced a breakthrough in the long-running bitter and highly personal row on Saturday, saying that she and Sinn Fein’s Mary Lou McDonald had agreed to talks on forming a devolved government in the province.

The Democratic Unionist Party had insisted after the Northern Ireland Assembly elections last month that it would not go into government with Sinn Fein until it ended its policy of refusing to talk to the unionists for five years because of what it said was Sinn Fein’s demand for an Irish Language Act. The DUP was the party of Ian Paisley, a hard-line loyalist who died in 2013.

Northern Ireland will remain without a devolved government for the next few months after the Ulster Unionists, nationalist SDLP and Greens said they will not take part in power-sharing arrangements.

The parties are unhappy about a potential deal proposed by Arlene Foster, who becomes first minister in a new DUP-Sinn Fein coalition government if it happens.

The Northern Ireland Assembly will be dissolved on Wednesday in a move that had been expected to end two and a half years of crisis in the province.

However, the Ulster Unionists are boycotting Wednesday’s vote - which will see Ms Foster become first minister in a six-party coalition- because of the DUP’s planned partnership with Sinn Fein.

But a Madrid judge has overruled that decision after Barcelona appealed.

After the flag was banned, Catalan nationalist organisations had decided to hand out 10,000 Scottish Saltires at the Madrid final.
Scotland voted to stay in the United Kingdom in 2014, but the Spanish government will not allow Catalonia a similar referendum.

A good day for democracy then! I'm glad the court has ruled on this one.

From the article: _""The club celebrates that the judge's decision will allow the free expression of legal symbols and banners""_

Supporters had planned to have Scotland flags at the Vicente Calderon after the government's representative in Madrid decided not to allow Estelada flags for ""operational reasons"". ```
The Spanish Football Federation had argued against the banner being flown as it is a political symbol, it didn't want it to clash with flags from other countries. Catalonia's president, however, has repeatedly said he will hold a referendum on the region's future. Catalonia is one of Spain's 17 autonomous communities. ---------------------------

This text appears very long to be a summary.  How long is it?

The summary is the first paragraph from Wikipedia article.

There's really nothing original at all in the post. It just rewrites the wiki article into a news article format. It should either be an excerpt from the wiki article or it should be a proper synopsis of what the article is about.

I was curious, so I read other wiki articles that discuss the same subject. This is not a ""news article"", it's not from ""news magazine"", and I don't think it should be called one.
And it certainly doesn't rewrite. It summarises.

Fair, and it is about a newsmaker who committed murder, so it is also interesting from that perspective.
But at least have a link to the original content if you're going to take up space on HN summarising someone else's work.

For the US President to make such an announcement after so many attempts to get it passed into law is a sign that people are getting their much promised health care through the act, Obama said.

The president's declaration came shortly before a report released by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which said that 11 Million Americans will be benefitted by Obamacare in 2014.

CMS said that the healthcare law, is providing more affordable and accessible health care to millions of Americans. The report on Thursday, also said that 6 million other Americans will see affordable and accessible insurance after the law.

CMS said that by 2014 most employers in the US will have to offer affordable coverage to their employees regardless of their age. So employer-subsidized coverage will no longer be based on the applicant's age.

``

But some Americans will still have no coverage, CMS said. Obama said that there was still a lot of work to do so that the Affordable Health Care act was to deliver on its promise. ``

In all, there were about 15 percent of Americans last year that had no heath insurance coverage through an employer, the White"

  Well, as I stated earlier, a lack of fiscal stimulus has been the biggest reason many analysts are expecting the US economy to slow. In fact, the US economy in the 3rd quarter contracted at its rate of -0.6%. This is compared to a +2% pace in the 2nd quarter. There are 2 reasons the Federal Reserve is likely to have no other solution than raising interest rates: to stimulate a faster pace of growth or because it needs to cut spending. The former has been the standard approach, with the latter usually the alternative.

  The US Federal Reserve has been cutting interest rates at a -0.3 pace per quarter over the past year. This is despite the US unemployment rate being 9.2%, which is lower than it has ever been since World War II. There could be even less to cut, with the US economy contracting by -0.6% this quarter. We expect that the US economy will slow in the early part of next year, which is why we are going to see the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. But not without a fight from congress.

The Federal Statistics Office on Thursday reported that industrial production rose 1.1% in September from the previous month, the same rate as in August and higher than the consensus forecast in a Reuters survey for a 0.9% increase.
The fall was a surprise, with some economists expecting industrial output to rise, Germany's economy ministry said.
Output grew at an annual rate of 1.5% in the first nine months of 2011, helped by a 1.3% expansion in manufacturing compared with the same period in 2010, Destatis said.

  Full analysis follows below:

     (BERLIN, OCTOBER 9) -- German industrial production fell sharply in September, with output in most industrial sectors losing ground from August. The drop was a surprise, with some economists expecting an increase.
The Economy Ministry said the decline was mainly because of weaker output among machinery and computer and electronic-parts makers.
Machinery manufacturers' output dropped by 4.8 percent in September from August, while electronic-parts production dropped 1.7 percent. Car makers also posted a sharp drop, with output of cars, trucks, trailers and buses sliding 6.6 percent.
Other manufacturers, such as food and rubber manufacturers, saw their output rise 2 percent in September.
Overall German industrial production in July to September fell 0.3 percent from the previous three months, the Economy Ministry said.
September industrial production in Germany is usually positive, so the decrease in September was unusual. ""A slowdown in some emerging markets had, to some degree, weighed production down,"" the German economy ministry"

It's actually not surprising, with some important caveats.
The growth for the summer was 1.1%, almost as bad as the 1.5 in the first summer. Even adjusting the seasonally adjusted growth rate, there's not much more of an impact than 1.2. It's still below the 2.0 growth in Q4 2013, and less than the 1.7% growth we saw at the start of the year.

SUNDAY, March 10, 2013 -- Engineers have regained communication with the Mars Science Laboratory mission's Curiosity rover, the rover's mission manager said in an update posted early Sunday. The rover suffered a computer glitch the day before that disrupted its communication link with mission control during a full-sky navigation exercise and an ongoing survey of a target area. The computer trouble is thought to stem from the rover's two backup computers, which were switched. The team has begun to identify, fix, and restore the rover's malfunctioning computer, which could restore the rover's full capabilities. ""The team is shifting the rover from safe mode to operational status over the next few days, and is troubleshooting the condition that affected operations yesterday, Nasa said. The condition is linked to a glitch in flash memory linked to the other, now-inactive, computer.""

By 1 March Curiosity will be up and running again. It's mission, a rover to determine whether the planet was, or was once, capable for human habitation, began last August. NASA says Mars is not the best place to live for long but for the rover's mission the landing site - a flat, ancient rock that researchers said could have formed from sedimentary layers formed by a watery climate - is the place to be.

Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory say the glitch is not expected to end the mission's historic year-long mission. The malfunction was discovered at noon Pacific Time [GMT -07:00], when the Opportunity rover went silent after having sent back five status-report transmissions since waking up early in the morning. The rover last spoke with mission controllers on Wednesday, when mission engineers on Earth were alerted that the rover had been put into the so-called safe mode by the main computer. The rover had been on a routine flight with its main computer, when the computer failed to transmit commands to the rover. The commands were transmitted by a second computer, which was already on Mars and operating normally. Mission engineer Steven Mutchler says the rover is in a ""minimal-activity"" stage, but that's typical for a rover on its first orbit. ''

Article: U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Venezuelans to reject the country's increasingly authoritarian government, saying it was no friend to democracy and was hindering the recovery of its collapsing economy. Biden was speaking on a visit to Colombia, which is home to some 800,000 Venezuelans fleeing a wave of violence and political repression at home. ""The president we have today has made a choice not to govern,"" said Biden, who also met Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in Havana to discuss the migrant crisis. Maduro and Biden discussed ways to boost trade ties, which deteriorated when the U.S. recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido on Jan. 23 as interim president. Maduro, who accuses Guaido of attempting to stage a U.S.-directed coup, reiterated on Tuesday that he was not a dictator.

An interactive game with educational and fun values is a good starting place for students to understand the basic rules of a simple game, and to have a sense of mastery of the basic strategies they need to play the game successfully.

Some students love playing the game and develop a deep appreciation of strategy and mastery. For others, it’s a way to avoid work. While the game does have its detractors, the most common criticism focuses on the game’s ability to make you win, not the strategies one can use as part of the game – which are as simple as possible.

Organic camel milk is produced by camels on dry land, and is available all year round. Our pure camel milk costs approximately half that of cow's milk, so customers will be able to taste the difference in flavour and aroma. Like cow's milk, camel milk is rich in Vitamin A, Vitamin D and calcium. It is also a source of protein, providing up to 30 per cent of your daily requirements.   Camelicious Coffee Company has launched our organic camel milk products in support of the work done by development charity Farm Africa.

22601,0,"A Pakistani security official said Sunday that security forces have killed the mastermind of a gun and bomb attack on the headquarters of the Pakistani army in the garrison city of Rawalpindi.

The attack Saturday killed 10 people and wounded at least 40.

Interior Ministry spokesman Zaman said the man killed Sunday near the capital Islamabad was the deputy head of the Pakistani Taliban, responsible for attacks on Pakistani security forces, government workers and civilians since 2001.

Police said the man was killed by security forces who clashed with his accomplice who fled.

The militants were trying to free the five policemen. The army was not providing information on them.

The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility, but had no further details.

The army said the attack started Saturday morning with two armed men entering the grounds of the army headquarters, opening fire and taking hostages in a room. By the end of the day four hostages were released, including the chief of a state-run hospital in Rawalpindi. The five militants who were held are believed to be senior commanders but there was no further detail on them. The army said they were not taken alive and their bodies have been recovered, so all 10 people killed in the attack were militants."

But most wanted to have their say, and it wasn't always what I expected.
I was braced for some pithy comments about senior politicians, but hardly what came: one was described to me as a ""Marxist Zionist war criminal"", even though the individual concerned is none of these things.
These three men - who described themselves as ""nationalists"" - didn't like anyone else any better. Politicians were all the same, in it for themselves, and they wouldn't vote for any ever again. Well, maybe UKIP. But probably not.

Is there something fundamentally different about Britain, France, the Netherlands and the US? Is the internet destroying the world? These are the questions that my colleagues and I wanted to answer. Our research reveals four significant factors that explain why there is a disconnect between public opinion and politicians. 1. Electing leaders through direct democracy makes everyone cynical. There is no ""one size fits all"" solution when it comes to selecting politicians for office; instead, a wide range of systems are in use across Europe. The UK has an elected first-past-the-post parliamentary system in which voters elect constituency MPs to represent them in parliament. The French have an elected national assembly that elects the president. The Dutch have a system that combines several different voting systems; in a recent election, they used PR with block lists and party lists, as well as direct voting.[a] In Australia"

Self Harm (often referred to as self-mutilation) is the act of deliberately harming oneself - typically with objects such as a knife, razor, burning matches or cigarette butts. There are different types of self harm, in which we have sub-categories of injury. The main types of self harm in adults are: Physical Self Harm - This type of self harm relates to any type of injury caused by the abuser which could be the visible aspect of a physical injury, or an internal physical injury that is undetectable to the victim. Internal Physical Injury - this subcategory of self harm is often referred to as psychological/emotional/psychological (PIP). The subcategory refers to a physical injury caused by the abuser. This injury does not need to be detected by the victim, so if the victim has no idea what has caused the attack, there is therefore no way to identify it is self harm. Psychological Damage - Psychological damage or disorder refers to any type of internal psychological injury caused by the abuser. This can include psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety, psychosis and others.

Despite his recent history of joining both the Conservatives and UKIP, Nigel Farage is still the same ambitious, scheming British politician who will say, and do, anything to advance his career. He is a man driven by ambition - nothing more, nothing less.
        2. His success on the debate stage depends upon being given the opportunity. Nigel Farage was selected as the leader of UKIP because of his performance in the first two TV debates last year. He is the natural, obvious choice because his party is growing and he has a huge advantage over most other party leaders. He did not have to convince his own party. He did not have to prove his leadership credentials. He did not have to convince the nation. As a result, Nigel Farage had the opportunity to make the most of it and he did just that.

For the second straight year, youth and adult membership in the Girl Scouts has dropped sharply, intensifying pressure on the 102-year-old youth organization to find ways of reversing the trend.

According to figures provided to The Associated Press, the total of youth members and adult volunteers dipped to 2.8 million in the 2013-2014 year, down 6 percent from last year and down 11.6 percent from a peak of 3.8 million five years earlier. The organization also announced Tuesday that it lost $9.9 million last year, a decline of 6.5 percent from the year before.

While the Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) have had an array of recent internal difficulties, CEO Anna Maria Chavez attributed the decline primarily to broader societal factors such as the decline of the labor force participation rate for adults and the rise of single parenting.

UK clothing sales slump as M&S goes back to basics to reverse decline > M&S reports fall in first-quarter clothing sales

By James Davey
LONDON, 19 July 2016 (Reuters) - The reinvention drive at Marks & Spencer was dealt a blow on Wednesday as poor weather kept customers away from its stores in Britain, its UK retail business reported a double-digit fall in clothing and homeware sales, the worst since 2008.
The group's sales performance was overshadowed by disappointing first-quarter consumer numbers, as its clothing, home and beauty unit struggled to reverse its decline.
It is not yet clear that management's plans to reposition the chain in food, clothing and homeware, with fewer promotions, will resonate with British shoppers.
""We have turned M&S's new direction for the future into action as we make the business simpler, stronger and faster,"" said chief executive Steve Rowe. ""We still have a lot of work to do, but all our teams have made great strides.""

Takasu fulfilled his promise by presenting cheques of $200,000 and $190,000 to coach Samson Siasia and captain John Mikel Obi respectively on behalf of the team.
He met with them two hours after Nigeria defeated Honduras 3-2 in the bronze medal play-off.
""The $200,000 covers the bonuses and allowances as promised and the $190,000 is for the bronze medal,"" Takasu told BBC Sport.

83521,3,"A summary of the key points:

More than half of young Britons no longer aspire to buy a home - bucking a trend that is more akin to French and German renting culture.

Today's figures come alongside news that house prices in parts of Central London have rocketed by 116 per cent in the past eight years - with Mayfair homes outstripping this at a staggering 139 per cent increase in value.

And while an overwhelming 93 per cent of Brits aged between 55 and 75 said they still saw owning their own property as the 'ultimate goal', just a third of under-35s felt the same way.

Just over half of under-35s (57 per cent) live in homes they do not own, according to the survey by financial protection specialist LV=..

And 42 per cent of them are renters - even though many said they could afford to.

This changing outlook mirrors the culture in Germany and France, where long-term renting is the norm.

Germany has the greatest proportion of renters in Europe as 61.2 per cent choose to rent, rather than own their home.

It is seen as perfectly acceptable alternative brought about largely by the reluctance of banks to loan money for mortgages -"

In the past decade young people in Britain have chosen to live rent-free. The traditional idea of homeownership is fast vanishing. As I wrote in June:

I found a great little article by Jonathan Raban in June '13 which tells quite clearly the current state of Britain and the way young people there are choosing to live. It is quite alarming. In brief, over the past decade of economic uncertainty, with banks refusing mortgages on a regular basis and people losing their homes, young people have looked to rent more. The rent was cheaper and with a stable and flexible arrangement, it was more attractive than continuing to own. Thus, young people have been renting more. The number of under 35s renting in UK is now increasing with new research showing. In particular the East of England has seen a rise from 28.5 per cent to 60 per cent in just 4 years.

Some of the reasons young people are choosing to not own a house might have something to do with the price of. In"

Liverpool are planning a last-ditch effort to lure unsettled Belgium striker Radamel Falcao to Anfield, the Daily Mail has revealed. The Spanish giants have so far refused to let the Colombian striker go at any price this summer.

Falcao arrived in Madrid this week, keen to end the speculation linking him with Liverpool and Manchester City. As revealed by this newspaper on Thursday, the 27-year-old hopes to go to a club where he will be guaranteed a place in the XI as he looks to get back to his best.

Rodgers told the club’s website recently: ‘We would still like to do some business. ‘Across the board we still want to add a little bit more depth to what we have.’

In the meantime, Liverpool will offer him a one-year contract. If no offer materializes for Falcao there is concern in the Anfield boardroom that they may lose their interest in the striker in the next week.

Rodgers is keen to add another goalscorer to the squad and believes Falcao’s goal-scoring record over the last 10 years is far superior to that of any player signed"

For a football club to do something like this is a joke. You'd think a place like Coventry would be more of a force than Barnsley and Wolves. I hope he moves on.

I think with the way Clarke's played the last couple of seasons he might deserve to play in a better league. I'm a Wolves fan (my dad played for them back when they were at Molineux) and I really want him to stay but can't see it happening. We can't keep all of our top players and he's one of the best scorers in the league.

I agree. He has been nothing but a shining star for Coventry, especially this season. He is a great poacher in the box, and I'd hate to see him playing against teams that are not struggling to beat relegation. I hope he stays.

Leon Clarke is a superb goal scorer and we have had two great seasons"

James Wignall, from Chorley in Lancashire, was visiting a friend in Mayfield Lane, Croston, last month when he and eight friends were approached by two police officers. It was not immediately clear whether the constabulary was responding to a neighbour's complaints that Wignall had been scaring horses with a skipping rope as he trained in the country lane. The boy's mother, Carol Wignall, said today that no offence took place. She said: 'What was he supposed to do, just sit out in his back garden? 'He is an athletic boy and he likes to exercise. What is frightening is what they have put him through. 'What is there not to like about this boy? How dare they accuse him of anything, especially when the police are supposed to be apolitical?' Wignall had a short-lived career as a professional boxer last year and has won 14 of his 17 fights. He was training for a tournament when the police action took place.

Meteorologists and their computer models were still working on Thursday to figure out exactly why so much of the snow fell and what will happen this weekend. And forecasters were still trying to determine how many more inches of snow could be on their way in the Midwest and Northeast this weekend. Meteorologists generally agreed, however, that conditions would drastically improve by late Saturday and Sunday.

After a week of cold and accumulating snow, meteorologists are finally predicting a turnaround.

    City of Gloucester

The Stanhope Group has taken the decision to withdraw from the King Square project in the City of Gloucester after its application for outline planning permission to replace the existing bus station was formally refused.

The council's planning committee refused the application on October 28.

The application was refused by a majority of councillors with Cllr Martin Griffiths and Cllr John Williams being the only two out of eleven voting in favour.

Cllr Griffiths voted in favour of the application on the previous Planning Committee which refused the application on March 5, 2014.

During that meeting then ward councillors Cllr Michael May, Cllr Michael Brown, Cllr Gareth Evans, Cllr David Waddington, Cllr Brian Davies and myself were unanimously critical of the council's handling of the application.

The chairman of the Planning committee at the time had to suspend both meetings when row broke out between councillors.

It has subsequently been made clear to me by members of the executive at the city council that the planning chief officer at the time, Cllr Ian Bevan, knew of the concerns many councillors had and the council"

In essence the company, 'Stanhope PLC', which owns the property adjoining King Square, a brownfield site, had an option to make a significant investment in the site and, having done considerable work on planning and design, was expected to submit an application early this year. However, with the economic collapse and the company running into financial difficulties, it's now unclear whether or not an application will be made.

To be clear, we haven't been told that there is a full-scale decision to pull out.  We have been told that discussions with the company, the potential for a collapse have been initiated, and there is, we believe, a genuine chance that the project, for now, would not make it through to the planning stage.

The article is intended to show that, despite claims to the contrary, it is the US that has been involved in a cover-up.  The title is also misleading because the article implies that Nisman's body was found in a dumpster.

The fact that he was found in his apartment has been carefully ignored by TIME and other US media.

Nisman's body was cremated and a cremation certificate issued - but all the bodies of Argentine authorities are cremated.

I suspect you are trying to make a point about the Argentine President having a close relationship with Iran.  It is in the context of a recent article by the Washington Post which showed how the relations between the two countries have improved over the years.

To be completely honest, I don't believe that any Argentine official, high or low, has had close relations with Iran.

This is just an example of how some Argentine media have manipulated the facts and the real intentions of Argentina (such as the case with the terrorist attacks of September 11).

The Argentine press does this on a daily basis.

The Bishop of Blackburn, Rt Rev Julian Henderson, this afternoon led the service of unveiling the memorial plaque at the reburial site of the former St Peter's churchyard in Wainwright Way.

It was unveiled by representatives of the Blackburn Diocese to commemorate 200 burials at the graveyard from the early 1800s. The discovery of the graves by archaeologists and contractors constructing the new link road is a reminder of the scale of deaths during that period.

The simple plaque will now be a permanent reminder of the site of the church's predecessor and the scale of mortality in that period. It was paid for by members of the church's former congregation and the Church Commissioners of England.

The Bishop, said: ""The story of these burials is an important reminder of how devastating infectious disease were for those in the Victorian Age.

""Despite the efforts of our modern NHS to provide care to the vulnerable, the scale of mortality will remain stark.

Lancashire County Council, which carried out the ground-breaking examination has commissioned the exhumation of other historic sites in a bid to build on the project.

The council is now looking at the site of St Margaret's Church in Nelson, which opened in 1895.

The project was inspired by the discovery of the remains of more than 200 children at the former Orchard Street School - known in the early years as the ""baby graveyard"" - during the construction of an extension to Blackburn College near to the old Vicarage Garden.

Work carried out for the College extension was suspended after the discovery of the school remains.

Last year, a group of parents, including the author Colin Dexter, claimed that local children had been buried on the site of a disused railway yard, just yards from a housing estate.

Dr Mike Harrison, a former archaeologist for the county council, believes that the original railway site was an ""industrial cemetery"", with its graves dating from the 19th Century"

The most important word in golf's first decade was: Tiger

By Mark Gleeson, CNN • Updated 31st October 2013, 18:06 Comment (1) Print This Article

PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (CNN/Money) — From the moment Tiger Woods hit golf's biggest blow with his famous ""Hail Mary"" shot, it's been a rocky road for the man who's supposed to be its biggest beneficiary, Phil Mickelson.

In a decade marked by the meteoric rise of Woods, it's been a steep, steady decline for the man once considered the best in the world. The five-time major winner once owned the game with a record 14-stroke win over Mickelson in the 2002 US Open.

After a long stretch of relative anonymity, Mickelson regained his mojo with a career-ending win at the 2006 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, but it has slowly slipped away ever since — just like Woods' supremacy over the game.

Mickelson's game has often lacked the finesse and consistency that once distinguished Woods as the undisputed world's best. And a pair of major championships, his last of"

The government is trying to avoid facing up to the fact that it is in the middle of the biggest and most rapid transition from traditional high-carbon electricity generation to new low-carbon energy sources to ever happen anywhere in the world.  This transition is expected to create a large energy capacity gap.2. This new policy vacuum is deterring private and public sector investment in new energy supplies – just a few months before world leaders are expected to agree in Paris to agree to tackle CO2 emissions and the challenges they pose to the global climate.3.  The UK economy has suffered the greatest recession in 80 years and, with high prices for foreign gas imports and high oil prices, UK consumers have paid the heaviest price for this recession compared with most other developed economies and are now seeing the highest inflation of modern times.  Any UK policy which undermines the investment and innovation needed to cut emissions and bring energy prices down will have a direct adverse impact on the UK economy and national energy security.```

The authors of the WEC report said a vacuum in energy policy since the election was deterring investors needed to create new electricity supplies.

It said it was committed to securing energy supplies through nuclear and shale gas.
The criticism from the WEC follows a complaint from the UN's chief environment scientist that the UK was turning away from renewables, just as they were being embraced by the rest of the world in the run-up to Paris climate talks this month.
The WEC report ranks countries on their policies to keep the lights on, bills and carbon emissions down. It says the UK has been a leader in these policies.

UK Government accused of misleading over its renewable energy plans

Article: The British Green Party's deputy leader has called on the government to release its renewable energy targets, saying it had misled Parliament and the country over its progress towards them.

The deputy leader of the Greens, Caroline Lucas, told the BBC's Newsnight: ''There is a lot of uncertainty among businesses at the moment in the renewables industry as to whether they have a contract and with what money,''
""Our party is looking for a commitment to a policy beyond 2030 to keep the lights on and keep bills down that would provide the certainty that would enable business investment to be made.""
In a letter to the BBC, the Department for Energy and Climate Change said it was confident the targets would be met.
In September 2015, the department published an analysis stating it was on track to hit its 2020 target.
''We are confident that meeting these targets is still possible,"" it added.
The department told Newsnight that it would stick to its policy strategy after the last elections and that the targets would be in line with international requirements.

Is there a problem with my summary?

The article says 30.  His bio says 31.

http://www.espncricinfo.com/s CricketArchive/pages/articles/74443.asp

Why should this article on his departure be different? His departure from Surrey is happening at the end of the season; it doesn't say ""Pietersen has scored 40 tons for Surrey..."" it talks about his departure from Surrey. For a change.

The total energy transmitted into Mars orbit by the spacecraft is 2.4 million billion watts per second (BWP/s), or approximately the equivalent of the electric power consumed by 500 million Euro-Class homes on Earth.

The heat shield and active solar array (which both absorb heat energy) provide the means by which Martian orbit energy can be transformed into kinetic and electrical energy, so that it can eventually be converted to power for operations in Martian orbit.

For the first time, the surface and surface area distribution of Mars have been clearly visualised with remarkable accuracy; an unprecedented 3D map of more than 1,000 Martian sites is available. The resolution is better than 100 metres on the order of a few hours.

Mars Express comprises the European Space Agency/German Aerospace Centre (ESA–DLR) Mars Express mission and the NASA ExoMars 2004–2013 mission.

72298,1,"Kabul verdict brings Farkhunda closure

  By David Loyn, BBC news, Kabul

  A Kabul court has found nine of 14 accused of beating and killing a woman to death guilty.

  Some of the court members were attacked during the proceedings.

  During the sentencing phase of the trial, Farkhuna's brother, Asadullah, led dozens of men in the court chanting ""shame on you"" to the judges, in a show of opposition to the sentences.

  The case first came to light last April when people went to the office of the human rights commission and the office of the national police chief.
The case brought to light the plight of women in Afghanistan where many suffer domestic violence. Farkhunda, a 28-year-old university student, died after being beaten about the head with a wood panel and set on fire.
Ms Farkhuna had been arguing with an amulet seller over his practice of peddling charms to women at a shrine.
The amulet seller is one of those sentenced to death.
She was initially blamed for desecrating a Quran by a group of the seller's companions; and a number of Afghans were recorded as saying they saw her do it."
72298,2,"The 28-year-old woman called Farkhunda was beaten to death after being accused of burning a copy of the Koran, although witnesses say she did not.
It took just four days for the verdicts to be reached. Eight men were sentenced to 16 years in prison and 18 others found not guilty.
The incident led to widespread protests against the treatment of women.
A decision in the case of 19 policemen accused of failing in their duty to prevent the attack is expected on Sunday.
Farkhunda's brother told the BBC that the family were not satisfied with the verdict and that all of the main defendants should be put to death.
Farkhunda had argued with an amulet seller about his practice of peddling charms to women at the well-known Shah-Du-Shamshaira shrine, which is within walking distance of the presidential palace and Kabul's main bazaar.
The amulet seller is one of those sentenced to death on Wednesday.
In the course of the argument Farkhunda was accused of burning the Koran and a crowd overheard and attacked her.
In confession statements read in court, some of the accused admitted they had been drawn in by the claims. An official investigator has said there is no evidence"

Royal Ascot, located on the outskirts of west London, is one of the world's most prestigious and spectacular sporting events. For seven weeks in early June, Ascot plays host to the best horses of the Royal and International Studs, Europe's leading racehorse breeding company. This exclusive five-day event is attended by the Queen of England and the British Royal Family. The event is notable for not only its racing but also its dress codes, which often involve elaborate headpieces. It also features the Royal Ascot Handicap Stakes, Gold Cup and the Queen Anne Stakes in which the Queen Anne, for which Princess Margaret serves as the race's patron, is an important race for a European sprinter. Princess Margaret, wife to Queen Elizabeth II, attended the 2009 Royal meeting's Royal Ascot for the 50th time. She is the only British royal to be invited to attend the Royal Ascot's most important event, the Gold Cup, since the Queen's grandmother took part in the first contest in 1810. The Royal Ascot was the world's leading racing competition prior to its decision not to invite European teams for the Olympics in 1912, although it returned in 1984 and has now established itself as the world"

94675,1,"The main argument/summary  of the news is : "" Emirates is facing the prospect of losing two of FIFA's biggest sponsors """
94675,2,"A recent controversy surrounding FIFA has left the organisation fighting against mounting evidence of corruption in the wake of a $150 million bribery case. Emirates' decision to end its sponsorship deal leaves FIFA looking at being without two of its biggest partners for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Meanwhile, the governing body of world football is facing the pressure of another potential blow after it was revealed that Sony's contract with FIFA for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa is coming to an end. FIFA and World Cup sponsors such as Sony have been hit by a series of allegations surrounding bribery, corrupt practices and alleged money-laundering. The latest controversy surrounds a U.S. Department of Justice indictment which claimed a number of Latin American soccer officials and other defendants had received substantial bribes from sports marketing and television firms. A spokesman for UEFA was reported to have said: 'We have concerns about the recent investigations surrounding FIFA and football which will have a damaging effect on the game and the people who enjoy playing it. We hope these investigations can be brought to a close and the football we all love can be protected.' One of the biggest scandals to have engulfed world football came in May, when a court in Miami unsealed indictments involving the sports and media industries, including executives at soccer's governing body FIFA, and"

94675,4,"FIFA is facing the prospect of losing two of its biggest sponsors after airline Emirates decided not to renew its contract and electronics giant Sony also considering ending its links with the world governing body. The confirmation comes four months after a number of FIFA's official World Cup partners expressed concerns about the negative publicity surrounding the latest allegations of corruption. Emirates' contract expires next month and the Dubai-based airline has confirmed it will not renew its sponsorship. FIFA said it has known of the decision since 2012. FIFA president Sepp Blatter is facing the prospect of losing two of the organisation's biggest sponsors. It is understood Qatar Airways - owned by 2022 World Cup hosts Qatar - is considering becoming a sponsor in its place. FIFA confirmed that Emirates will not be renewing its deal and that talks are ongoing with Sony. Samsung, which is a major Olympic sponsor, may take over from Sony. Both Emirates and Sony are among FIFA's official partners - the six top tier sponsors who provided hundreds of millions of pounds in sponsorship income to the world governing body. FIFA said in a statement to the Press Association: `Emirates had already informed FIFA back in June 2012 about the restructuring of its sponsorship concept and FIFA respects this.

The announcement was made by Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Abullah in Egypt, which has been leading mediation efforts. Israel and Gaza militant groups signed a deal Monday for a cease-fire, but Israel's army maintained a large operation in Gaza and thousands of Palestinians protested in the West Bank. The deal was confirmed by Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority. Under the interim accord, Israel agreed to a 48-hour ceasefire, a promise of which would be enough to allow Palestinian factions to transfer Qassam rockets to other groups such as Hamas, who are responsible for firing the rockets out of Gaza. Both Israel and militant groups also said they would respect the cease-fire, a key point in the agreement.
The news from Gaza is that there is jubilation, but many people are worried about the situation going further. An announcement on Gaza's FM radio spoke of a cease-fire, but the Israel Radio was reporting of continued fighting. At the same time, in the West Bank there was widespread solidarity against Israel. A senior West Bank Fatah official told the Jerusalem Post: ""There is a growing consensus that this is the new intifada,"

79936,1,"In Myanmar, the human rights community is fighting to repeal a two-child limit imposed on Muslim families by authorities in two townships in the western state of Rakhine.

Under a plan by national authorities to enforce a “population policy”, there are now just 20 months until Myanmar’s 2010 census, which determines which places receive development spending.

In both townships, local officials have issued guidelines to local religious leaders, instructing them to warn Muslims against having more than two children.

The religious leaders have written to the national Population Control Committee to request it to stop the order until a government survey of people’s fertility is carried out.

“We can’t force people to be responsible, but the government should not take the draconian stance that they are taking now to enforce their agenda,” said Aye Maung Nyein, president of the Myanmar Organisation for Social Welfare.

“Now, the Muslims here are being accused of causing insecurity with overpopulation when, in fact, it is the government that should be at fault.”

The Population Control Committee was set up last year to curb the growth of the population – as many as 2,650"
79936,2,"Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has joined human rights activists in criticizing a two-child limit imposed on Muslim families by authorities in areas of western Myanmar in an attempt to control their population.

The government of Myanmar's Rakhine State, which borders Bangladesh, says the restriction was ordered in two townships that have the biggest populations of Rohingya.

''The government is using family planning as one of the ways to limit the growth of the Muslim population,'' the head of Myanmar's Center for Peace and Security Studies, Thura San Lwin, told the Associated Press on Thursday. The practice of limiting the number of children a Muslim woman can have ''doesn't apply to Buddhists,'' he said.

Human rights activists say the new population limits violate the human right to marry and have children. ''There's no scientific support for this rule,'' said Human Rights Watch.

The ruling party in Rakhine did not respond to a request for an interview.

Muslim community leaders say the new census also underlines discrimination in the Buddhist-majority nation where religious minorities include minority Buddhists, Hindus, Christians and Rohingya Muslims.

The United States and other Western powers have urged that conditions be created for Muslim Rohingy"

43672,1,"But it has been more than 40 years since the UK last got around the negotiating table and it could be a little rusty. Here are four key requirements to getting a good deal.
When it comes to trade deals, the devil is in the detail. Trade deals have grown incredibly complex - the recently concluded deal between the EU and Canada runs to almost 1,600 pages and covers everything from fisheries to  financial services.
Successful negotiations require a skilled - and large - team, but the UK has not negotiated a trade deal since 1973. The EU has 596 trade negotiators and the UK urgently needs a similarly sized team to craft new deals with major trade partners.
A first step will be to bring back the handful of experienced and expert UK nationals in the European Commission. They will know what to expect when facing European negotiators across the table.
Successful negotiation involves clearly identifying your own trade interests and not simply reacting to the other side's. The UK Government must know what it wants from any deal, what it wishes to keep off the negotiating table and the concessions it is willing to make.
This is not easy. A well-prepared government will have consulted extensively with businesses, small and large, as well as consumer groups and trade unions. UK-"

CASE

The background to Jason McGovern's death --

At the end of the night that night at a bar, Jason McGovern, and his friends, came across some of the men responsible for the fight outside the door.

They were having a drink, but as soon as the McGovern group walked into the front of the bar, things escalated from bad to worse--

It is said the McGovern group was not involved in the fight and the reason they were there, was because one member of their group, was carrying his partner’s bag.

That the bag being carried, caused some upset at the nightclub and people were shouting, demanding that the bag be handed to the people responsible for the disturbance.

The bag was left on"

The pair had denied the charge and claimed that a fight had broken out in the car park outside where they were standing minutes earlier.
A post-mortem examination found that Mr McGovern suffered multiple injuries including a broken back and shoulder blade and severe bleeding on the brain.
Judge Mrs Justice Keegan found the prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr Gaughan inflicted the fatal blow.
However, she said Mr Gaughan, from Derryquin Road, Greencastle, had provoked the altercation."

72103,2,"It is the end of the road for Labour’s leadership. Jeremy Corbyn has won the first round of balloting but the real contest will begin on Monday when the membership gets to choose between Owen Smith and Labour's Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer.

The result was announced just after 21:00 BST, with Jeremy Corbyn comfortably seeing off his opponent and the party's Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell.

A close look at Labour's membership turnout reveals that, like the Conservatives, many of the party's supporters did not bother to vote despite claims that Corbyn's victory would be “overwhelming”.

With only 2.7 million of the party's members in total, that made up 38.8% of all the party's registered supporters. Those who did vote accounted for 53.6% of the party's entire membership - almost half a million extra votes than the leader.
Even if Corbyn had lost the contest with 40%, they would have had to win a further 30% of the extra 700,000 members to stay in with a chance.

The ballot was conducted on closed-book and, despite a huge campaign by Corbyn's Labour for membership to vote and even go public with the decision to vote, turnout was low"

6390,4,"LONDON: West Indies spinner Sunil Samuels has finally been cleared to bowl again after nearly three years on the sidelines -- and he is looking to take the big-hitting Aussie top order apart.
Samuels underwent surgery on his right elbow in 2009 and was banned from bowling in official limited overs contests with immediate effect. He was allowed to resume bowling in September 2012 but only if a finger-mounted magnet device was attached to his bowling arm to monitor the position of his arm joints.
Samuels was cleared to bowl again in December 2015 after testing at Loughborough University showed his elbow extension was within the permitted 15 degrees.

""I am definitely going to go for the big hitters right now.""
Although pleased to have cleared the first hurdle, it has not been smooth sailing since Samuels' return to bowling. He complained about losing his accuracy and the finger-mounted magnet device did little to help him regain that.

On Thursday 28 February, Denver City Council officially adopted Amendment 64, which legalizes the sale, possession and home cultivation of recreational cannabis to adults over the age of 21. This article from The Denver (Colorado) Sun describes how city officials have tried and failed to ban a celebration in Civic Center Park on 4/20, the numerical date of the first use of cannabis in history.

20924,0,"Bill Cassidy, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senator from Louisiana, has announced that his 17-year-old daughter is having a baby out of wedlock.''. You know the rest of the headline. If the entire headline isn't clear, a list or URL would have helped as well.

I was looking forward to reading the whole article but stopped after I read this:

``With an unwed teen daughter about to give birth, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Louisiana says: `My children have been the greatest blessing of our lives and we welcome our grandchild as a joyous addition to our family.''``

This is not what I think of when I hear the word ``grandchild''. It comes to mind as one of the most ungodly, blasphemous descriptions of life one can come up with. To the extent that ``the greatest blessing of our lives'' has any meaning, it must also mean the most abominable tragedy in our lives.

I realize that the point of the article was to report Cassidy's daughter's pregnancy, but to have ``Grandchild'' in the headline in conjunction to ``out of wedlock'' is not suitable for a Christian publication like this one."
20924,1,"Republican Senatorial candidate Bill Cassidy`s daughter is pregnant (after having sex at 17!) and will bring home a child which she cannot support. This adds another voice to the chorus of outraged reactions to the abortion law now facing voters because of our governor, Bobby Jindal.

This is exactly why people should vote against Mary Landrieu, a pro-choice liberal who, when faced with public pressure over this vote (from other Democrats as well as from conservative voters) has chosen to lie about what she *really* thinks.

Bill Cassidy is pro-life. All the other Republicans in the state are as well. The law will not pass here, and if it was passed it wouldn`t make much of a difference.

Let it be. I`ve already written to my congressperson (Jeff Landry) that I won`t back Mary Landrieu over Bill Cassidy. This is a clear-cut case of her own daughter being punished for her sins.

Here is a sample:

Your opposition to the proposed Louisiana law outlawing abortion has brought widespread criticism, including from many prominent Democrats, and threatens your reelection. Is this a fair assessment of your position, or were these other politicians misinterpreting you? I"
20924,2,"Bill Cassidy, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senator from Louisiana, has announced that his 17-year-old daughter is having a baby out of wedlock. A conservative Louisiana Republican seeking to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu announced Thursday that his unwed 17-year-old daughter is pregnant. Bill Cassidy, a U.S. congressman and medical doctor, is challenging Landrieu, a three-term incumbent, in a race that Republicans view as important in their quest to reclaim the U.S. Senate from Democrats. 'Earlier this year, Laura and I learned we will become grandparents this summer,' Cassidy said in a statement provided to the Times-Picayune of New Orleans. 'Our children have been the greatest blessing of our lives and we welcome our grandchild as a joyous addition to our family. 'Our daughter now faces a more challenging future than her peers. She has our unconditional love and support.' The 17-year-old mother-to-be will be a senior in Baton Rouge High School in the fall. The baby is due sometime this summer. The Cassidy campaign did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.''

The National Post, owned by media mogul Paul Rivett, is a conservative-leaning newspaper.

The Huffington Post's article ''Canada Election Polling: Does Stephen Harper or Justin Trudeau Have Better Hair?

In the first days of August, as Conservative politicians and pundits were still laughing off the ""nice hair"" remark, Liberal Party members held a rally in Vancouver Island in British Columbia, where they announced their ""Justin Trudeau bobblehead doll collection"".

   A Liberal Party fundraising campaign to raise money to replace Prime Minister Stephen Harper has raised just $12,000 despite its initial targets to raise $200,000. In July 2010, the Liberal Party had about $9 million in the bank.The Toronto Star

Conservative Party of Canada Leader Stephen Harper and Liberal Party Leader Justin Trudeau both have flowing dark tresses and both became celebrities as celebrities.

When the two are in the same room, the Conservatives say it is like being in a hair salon and the Liberals say they don't even know what the Conservatives are talking about.  Both men have also been on American TV shows (including David Letterman).
  For example, Stephen Harper"
98798,1,"The Conservative Party has been running an ad campaign called ""The Interview,"" in which all candidates are called out for a series of minor and seemingly irrelevant policy differences. While all the candidates in question have responded negatively, the Conservative Party has not gone through with a more serious follow up. Some have taken issue with the video itself, some have taken issue with the way Justin Trudeau's hair is dealt with, and some have taken issue with the fact that the Conservatives seem to care much more about the trivialities of a candidate's appearance than the substantive issues and policies of her or his platform.``
Ironic because we all know the best policy is always the hair policy!
(This is a satire of the article's summary so please stop hitting yourself.)
This was quickly followed by a full-page article in The Globe and Mail, the country's most influential daily, titled ""The hair follicle in politics"" highlighting what was being perceived as a double standard in covering political candidates.
It was not without controversy.
Mr Trudeau responded furiously on Twitter, writing ""I will not apologize for how I choose to wear my hair or how I was raised"", and accusing the Conservative leader of misogyny and sexism. The Conservatives said it was a parody and it was ""clear"
98798,2,"_but not the _ part.
Do you _ mean that ""That won't work in Canada of course"" is a good thing? I disagree.

Yes, there's a thin line between subtle humour and racism, but I'd argue the video's humour was far more subtle than not.

Not really. Here's a line of it (edited with no changes made to the video): ""Maybe if you were in charge of Canadian energy policy you wouldn't need a hairdresser all the time. Maybe then you could focus on the country's"
98798,3,"The video, which was removed from the Conservatives' website after the uproar, sparked online debates about Mr Trudeau's appearance.
Some pointed out he often wears his hair in a ponytail, and speculated it might be a wig, while others said Canadians are being too politically correct about this.
Meanwhile, Mr Trudeau appeared on television defending the style, but said it would be ""appropriate"" when taking questions.
His rival for the Liberal leadership, Michael Ignatieff, commented later: ""The time has now passed, of course, to talk about hair and who has nice hair.""

The Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) said on Wednesday it had received complaints about the ad.
The ad could return in a new format for a third wave of campaign-style ads starting next week.
The Conservatives had said the video had the backing of its chairman, Andrew Scheer, but when he was asked about the controversy on the show, he refused to talk about it.

The CBSC said its first round of complaints were received on July 20. Since then it has responded to about 5,000 more and expects to receive a total of about 15,000.

But the way BBC seems to have put it forward, it seems like a 'take over' (maybe 'overthrow' is a more correct term) - in the same way it seems like a 'take over' when a president takes over and becomes the leader of the opposition or vice versa.

It's not a takeover. It's a resignation.

To those who think that the problem lies with the writing style, I suggest that you ask yourself why they are not writing like this themselves.
The short version is that (a) Ed Miliband does not believe that he could win such a debate against the Conservative coalition by offering a genuinely detailed alternative economic policy, (b) the Ed Balls' team thinks they can lose it by pretending that Ed Miliband is not that dumb and (c) Ed Miliband himself still believes that an election debate on the specifics of his economic policy is not a good idea.

  I understand their first two positions, but not the third.
Do they know some polling which suggests that they could still get away with a detailed alternative economic policy. Are they trying to get one through the back door because they still think they can ""out-Tory"" the Tories by appearing to be more pro-business? I cannot think of any reason for this refusal which does not have to do with the leadership itself.
Somebody has to lead the party, after all.
I have no idea if it is possible to"
41170,1,"Ed Miliband knows he has a problem and can sense an opportunity.
The problem is Labour's lack of economic credibility - something every opinion poll confirms.
The opportunity is the chance to paint the Tories as not merely serious about cutting borrowing but ideologically obsessed with it.
He and Ed Balls believe that their lack of credibility is rooted not in the lack of understanding of their detailed economic policies, but in their perceived inability to say ""no"" to more spending.
Hence the headline from this speech is a warning that ""unprotected departments"" ie any other than the NHS and overseas aid, will face real cuts every year under Labour until the deficit is cleared.
What either of the Eds could have said today is that their alternative approach to the economy would allow them to borrow a lot more and spend more, at least in the short term.
This is because they are only committed to balancing the CURRENT deficit so can still borrow for capital or investment spending.
In addition they have said they will clear the deficit as soon as possible - which sounds tough but allows them two or three years more than the current coalition plan.
Ed Miliband's five principles of deficit reduction - spelt out in today's speech - are a restatement of his existing rhetoric"
41170,2,"Labour must seize the moment with an alternative to the coalition's cuts, says Labour Business Committee chair Ed Miliband today. He argues that the next Labour Government must stop spending on unprotected departments - so the Conservatives can no longer ignore the deficit - and to do so they must first meet their deficit reduction deadline. He also sets out five economic principles with the power to transform Britain's economy: fairer, faster, more fair, balanced and more balanced, with growth. The fifth point in Miliband’s plan involves borrowing money to fund the long-term investment in schools, hospitals and vital infrastructure needed over the next few decades.''

Ed Miliband will call for an emergency general election to be held no later than November.
Miliband will spell out new proposals for ``direct democracy'' which, if he is elected, will ``overcome'' the ``deadlock'' in the Commons over holding an early election.
His proposals would give ordinary voters three votes on major questions from a parliamentary ballot box in their own local area alongside a primary vote in the general election.
He will claim the Conservatives want to hold a ``referendum on a temporary Tory government,'' while their own ideas would ``overcome the deadlock in the Commons'' and the ``prolonged instability'' of a first past the post system.
The speech, set for tomorrow, is likely to be met with scepticism by Labour MPs.
The party is not keen to agree to an election at this stage with little prospect of being able to make a substantive progress over the next three months. The Tories are keen to capitalise with a summer campaign.
But Miliband will point to the Prime Minister's own pledge.
He will say: ``She promised MPs in 2005, and the voters in 2010, that if she lost a confidence vote, and didn't get support"

David Cameron is DELAYING a controversial appointment by Speaker John BERCOW over fears it could embarrass the Queen.

Government sources said David Cameron was effectively sitting on Mr Bercow’s decision to appoint Australian catering manager Carol Mills to the £200,000-a-year post of Clerk of the Commons, in charge of running Parliament.

His selection has been criticised by MPs on all sides, warning that Ms Mills lacks the knowledge to advise Parliament on constitutional matters.

This is a pretty good article.  What I wonder is, why Mr. Cameron does not have the same concern when it comes to the expenses, as he shows concerning another appointment.  I also doubt if Mr. Cameron would even care what the appointment was to.

He has some pretty bad issues about the expenses as well - he just doesn't seem to care that much about them.

He's an expert at saying what he's really thinking in 200-word quotes.

The same goes for the prime minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, and probably other democratic leaders in the world who are in the same political party, and who don't care about the expenses scandals.
The only surprise to me is that David Cameron hasn't been caught up in the expenses scandal in the USA. It must be something about him!"

During a 45-minute hearing, McCullough pleaded for the court to open an FBI report from 1957. A detective took the box to the bench.

42082,1,"The main argument is that the government cannot mandate a physician's action: as a natural human right, the power to commit one's own life is one reserved for the individual. A person who asks for a doctor-assisted suicide should be able to do so without interference. In the current scenario, one is being made to accept that he and his or her life, although of the highest quality, does not deserve to be continued. As per this argument, if the government wants to make sure that every individual has a right to live, then it cannot force its way and mandate such an action.

The argument also stresses the absence of a time frame or deadline. Some statutes in the US and in Europe impose a mandatory time frame or time period within which a doctor has to execute a lethal dose to a patient. In this paragraph, arguments are put forth how such mandatory prescriptions will be counterproductive and will only increase the demand for euthanasia, especially in places where it is not yet legal. For example, in California, a lethal dose must be given within a period of less than 3 hours. Thus, in such a case, a physician has no other option except to kill a patient rather than let him or her die by self-termination. The argument also refers"

. A study in the April 2009 journal Gerontology showed that between 1989 and 1994 deaths of Oregon residents on whose behalf assisted suicide had been approved by the courts went from eight to ten, and from ten to fourteen between 1994 and 1997.

A 2006 study by the Canadian Academy of Family Physicians suggested ""that legalizing physician-assisted suicide may significantly increase the rate of assisted suicide in jurisdictions having legalized it”. Also in 2006, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine compared assisted suicide in four US jurisdictions after it was legalized in Oregon for the first time. The report found that ""The rate of medical aid in dying (MAID) applications and actual MAID events increased rapidly with time after legalization.""

A 2015 study indicated that physician-assisted suicide is a controversial issue with public policy implications, but that most are not opposed. For example, there was only one state where more than 90% of respondents opposed legalising legalised physician-assisted suicide in both a survey in 2001 and a survey in 2015. A 2016 study found that physician-assisted death was more popular than in most medical specialties"

Was it because some FBI agents, perhaps most on the East Coast, did not feel that it was a big deal at the time and thought it was some petty crime or a hoax?
Or because federal agencies were worried about making him (the Tsarnaev) a martyr if he was killed first. (After all, if he had been killed there would have been only one suspect for the FBI to search).
What was really their purpose in getting him to the boat, not letting him return to the scene of the crime, then letting him slip away in the boat?

Austria's exclusive Swarovski crystals firm has been accused of profiting from the forced labour of teenaged girls living in Austrian care homes during the 1960s. The company, beloved of celebrities ranging from David Beckham to Paris Hilton and Jennifer Lopez to Nicole Kidman, says it has ordered an urgent independent enquiry into the allegations which surfaced in Austrian news reports this week. The claims state that the youngsters at the notorious St. Martin state-run care home near the Swarovski Austrian plant at Schwaz were employed to do 'piece work' on the crystals which are used in jewellery, fashion accessories and clothing. Reports stated they were paid next to nothing for their efforts.

62593,4,"The Vienna public prosecutor has launched a criminal investigation into Swarovski Austria in connection with allegations of child labour at one of its premises in Austria. The probe centres on the period 1961 to 1964, when the company was operating a factory in Swarovski's birth town of Schwaz. At that time, it was a state-owned enterprise set up to produce crystal for products ranging from mobile phones to kitchenware. The firm was privatized in 1992, when Josef Swarovski died. While an initial probe into child labour allegations found no evidence of it, the office said it had decided to revive the investigation following new allegations in Austrian media. The probe will determine whether children working at the factory, most of whom were at least 14 years old, were subjected to forced labour, the public prosecutor's office said. ```

It said the majority of rooms lack adequate daylight, offer little privacy and a significant number have no direct view out at all.
UCL said the building complied with all necessary planning regulations.
The magazine's annual Carbuncle Cup competition claims to recognise the worst architectural projects.
Designed by Stephen George and Partners for UCL, judges said what was once a historic red brick warehouse has now been largely demolished despite being protected.
It said: ""The original frontage has been retained in a cynical gesture towards preservation.
""But its failings go deeper: this is a building that the jury struggled to see as remotely fit for human occupation.""
Executive editor and Carbuncle Cup juror Ellis Woodman added: ""There is no small irony in the fact that the building stands on the same street as HMP Pentonville.""

Talksport article with Stephen George on Islington Council's refusal to grant planning permission for the Caledonian Road building to be a 'hall of residence' (which was overturned by a government inspector)

I know this is only about the architectural review, but the actual content is extremely relevant. The fact that an architectural review of the building was published that described it as ""having no discernable reason to be"" in its title is not a matter of opinion, it is a fact. So let me see if I can provide some additional facts which should be relevant to those who might be interested in the process of how planning applications are dealt with - in particular if anyone is aware of what exactly has become of a particular planning application I'm referring to, and why it has seemingly disappeared into the ether (as far as I am aware of).

Background : The UCL building in question is in Pentonville Road (a major north-south road in the Islington district). This building was once a warehouse at the north end of the road, which provided storage space for the docks which were on the north side of the canal and a road, near what is now the east end of Camden Street, between Smithfield and"

89510,1,"UNISON JANITORS BRIEFING:
CORDIA ARE REFUSING TO DISCUSS ISSUES FACILITATING STRIKE

The Unison union claims employers Cordia - a body of Glasgow City Council - are refusing to discuss the issues surrounding the strike.
It is over additional payments for tasks which the janitors say are ""dirty, unpleasant, involve regularly working outside or heavy lifting"".
Janitors first walked out in March and are set for further action on 20 April.
Cordia said they had given Unison three opportunities to outline their issues and that the matter was considered by a committee before being rejected.
A spokesman for the facilities company said: ""Cordia has completely exhausted all internal processes after negotiations with Unison and is not required to convene a meeting to further negotiate when at this stage there is no possibility of a settlement.""
Sam Macartney, Unison branch officer, said: ""We want justice for jannies in Glasgow.
""The city's parents, carers and the wider public will be rightly astonished that the employer is refusing to even meet these hard-working janitors and their trade union.""
Industrial action over the payment began on 19 January"
89510,2,
89510,3,"Background: The pay dispute involves janitors employed by Glasgow City Council. On 19 January 2008 they walked out in a dispute over the ""Working Contexts and Demands Payment"" - a one-off payment of between £500 and £1,000.
According to the Council, Cordia - employing some 2,000 people out of the Council's 2,300 - has stated that it plans to stop making the payment, claiming that under EU legislation it is forbidden to compensate for ""unhealthy or unhygienic working conditions"".
Unison believes that janitors are entitled to the payment according to the ""Working Conditions Directive"" issued by the European Commission in 1996.
The union said that Cordia's policy goes ""beyond the legal obligations"" and said if the company refuses to negotiate its claims, it will be ""opening up itself to possible employment tribunals, including the possibility that Unison could seek compensation for its members"".
Striking Janitors:

Unison claims the janitors are employed by a private company (Cordia) which holds a contract with the city council to run its civic offices. The union says that while they are employed by a Cordia subsidiary, they are actually paid for as ""Staff"

Cordia have completely exhausted all internal processes after negotiations with Unison and is not required to convene a meeting (yet?) to further negotiate when at this stage there is no possibility of a settlement.

Two incidents took place inside her patrol car and once inside a business after hours.

89313,1,"The BBC Trust's editorial standards committee has upheld a listener's complaint against a Steve Wright show, ruling that his Sunday morning radio programme breached guidelines on accuracy and interacting with listeners.
The programme featured listeners who called in with requests for romantic songs as well as dedications -- with the latter getting through most of the time -- but listeners could never be sure when their requests would actually be broadcast.
The complaint was made by the BBC itself after the listener was alerted by the on-air scripts of the previous Sunday’s show that the dedications would all be given prior to broadcast. The trust said that didn’t make the listeners aware that the show would go ahead without any dedications and only the songs played the Sunday before. This meant the show ""failed to comply"" with the BBC's guidelines, the trust wrote in its ruling. The trust also ruled that the show ""failed properly to interact with the audience"" after the BBC amended the on-air and phone messages to make it clear dedications would be considered for future programmes rather than the one being broadcast at the time of the call.

In a follow-up email, they advised that, in the run-up to the show, Steve would consider whether a song which he had planned to include was on the playlist – which was always different from Thursday’s production, so could not include songs played days, if not weeks, earlier.

I don't want to have to play it on an outdated version just to play old raids and dungeons. I would gladly pay Blizz money to play the classic version in 2016.

70065,1,"In a study released today, researchers from the University of California at Los Angeles’ School of Social Ecology, New York University, and others found that marijuana legalization in Colorado is associated with increases in marijuana use among adolescents and increases in marijuana sales to underage youth. These changes indicate that legalization has an adverse effect on public health, with associated increases in mental health disorders, substance-related arrests, and traffic stops by police.
The study also found that legalizing marijuana in Washington had no notable effects on cannabis use at the time of the study, and a positive effect on retail sales.

The study by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health published Tuesday found about one out of every eight Colorado residents over 12 reported using pot in the past month. Only in Rhode Island topped Colorado in the percentage of residents who reported using pot as often. The study averaged state-specific data over two-year periods.

expansions and ""people first policies"" to address the public's economic woes.

The Cosby Show: A Look Back in Time (Part 5 of 9)

On June 9, 1992, a grand jury was set to decide whether to charge Bill Cosby after he admitted to giving women Quaaludes to relax at a time when the drug was banned. In 1992, three women had come forward with similar stories about the entertainer. One, Andrea Constand, said she became so impaired she could barely walk while the other two alleged that he drugged and raped them. “No matter what I"

Intelligent electronic systems (IES) are becoming more and more common in security-related systems and applications. The complexity and size of IES increase rapidly.

However, because of the criticality of IES and their increasing use, it is desirable to make the existing security techniques more effective.

One Response to “Intelexit campaign against intelligence agencies”

I am quite surprised that the author of this article has not yet responded to the excellent comments on this piece. He seems to be suggesting that one should keep his silence for fear of reprisal. To do otherwise he suggests is to give aid and comfort to evil."

In response, the German government reiterated its stance that the security of German citizens is assured by appropriate law enforcement agencies  and refused to comment further on ongoing investigations by the Bundestag. No law enforcement staff working at the NSA were under criminal investigation for activities involving monitoring of German citizens or other private or business data, the government said.

  What does this say about F1?

  Why is there not a massive global protest against Bahrain and Abu Dabi?

The problem is that F1 owners want lots of money and there are a lot of people who have lots of money.

It is not like the US. There are millions of people with ""lots of money"" and only a handful want to spend it in F1.

The difference between the US and F1 is that Americans can buy the races or at least the highlights (after TV has run them) whereas the best of F1 needs a huge subscription and there are not that many countries - only the UK, Australia and Canada apparently - that care enough or have the money to subscribe."

1. Will Lewis Hamilton be world champion? On Sunday in Abu Dhabi, Lewis Hamilton will be crowned world champion for the second time. But if he does land the title once again, will his time in F1 really be at an end?

2. Fernando Alonso's chances: Although he has been champion twice (2003 and 2005), Fernando Alonso knows he will never be crowned world champion again. His team, Ferrari, is not working to its potential this year and, with Ferrari, Alonso does not have the chance.

Make something unique and different and people will notice that and take notice. Once you are successful people will see that they could use you to make something unique and different and they will try to replicate your success. There is already a huge competition and you cannot be like everyone else. Create something that is going to stand out. People will look for you and come to you. 2."

Chelsea are already planning for life without Mourinho. The Special One's future is very much up in the air.

Let's look at why footy fans can't wait for the summer.
Who's Jose?
Portuguese, former
Chelsea boss who has won the Premier League three times with the London club
Who's Pep?
Spanish, current Bayern Munich manager, has spent most of his career as a player, and then manager, at Barcelona.
Both men are renowned for being fiercely competitive, as well as super stylish.
Jose's known for his passion and entertaining humour - calling himself the ""Special One"".
Pep, on the other hand, is known for being cool, calm and collected.
The pair first met at Barcelona more than 20 years ago - when Guardiola was a player and Mourinho worked there.
They later became coaching arch rivals in Spain's La Liga - Pep managed Barca between 2008 and 2012, whilst Jose was the top boss at Real Madrid between 2010 and 2013.

Russian spy tells of KGB plot to back Benn

	By JENNA STONE, Associated Press
	WASHINGTON --- Oleg Gordievsky, a Russian spy who has lived in this country for the last 12 years, has provided new details of the Soviet Union's covert plan to back a British socialist on the British national political scene.

The plan, he told the British Broadcasting Corp. in an interview, was hatched by KGB agents in the early 1970s. They intended it to be carried out later, as they had little faith that the Soviet Union's left-leaning Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, would be around much longer.

But after a three-day conference on Britain at the Kremlin in April 1974, the KGB thought it was so obvious that socialist Tony Benn - then a back bencher in the House of Commons, the British Parliament's lower house - was going to be the next premier that it told its agents in the West to start collecting information on him for a future campaign.

''The whole thing seemed to be very natural - everyone knew it,'' Gordievsky said of the idea that Mr."

The source says that this was a cover story for being turned down as a Communist agent on the basis that he was too stupid. This is not surprising given the fact that Tony Benn was considered by some to be a bit of an idiot in the days immediately following his election to the shadow cabinet, where he spent much of his political career. Indeed, his appearance in a Militant Tendency Rally in 1984 caused a serious embarrassment, as he was seen to support the pro-USSR movement in the middle of a Cold War when most of Europe was a bit suspicious of that particular brand of capitalism and many Soviet-leaning European countries were either communist or communist-aligned. He was also accused of having sympathies towards the Black Panthers, an organisation with Marxist-Leninist beliefs that the American government tried to label a communist threat in the 1960s and '70s. He was also widely accused during that time of supporting apartheid (which he vehemently denied as being the case). His party membership was dropped in 1987 after"

98775,1,"Welsh Conservatives: Welsh Labour are running out of ideas
The Welsh Conservative Party have been in power in Welsh Local Authorities since the devolution of the National Assembly for Wales, so they know what their communities need, says Neil Hamilton.
With nearly a whole decade of experience and a first term as First Minister to learn from, Welsh Labour is going to face a test of their commitment to good governance and being responsible local government.  A strong Welsh Conservative Party is needed to provide an effective opposition to the Welsh Labour Party for the next five years.
There is a lot that both Welsh Conservatives and Welsh Labour can learn from the performance and success of the UK Conservative Party over the past eight years.  In an age of political gridlock it is no coincidence that the UK Conservatives consistently enjoy the approval rating of 54-55%.
Although the Welsh Conservative Party has a long standing relationship with Welsh Local Government, in the past they were often seen as being too hands on.  However, they have evolved their relationship with the Welsh Local Authorities, who now have an ability to put their trust on the Conservative government of the day in the event of disagreement.
Welsh Labour needs to take note, the Scottish NationalParty made their electoral breakthrough through developing closer links with the local community."

1. What went wrong?
The answer is quite simple ; the fact the Welsh media focused on issues that were at the time of the election least important to voters.
This was compounded by the Welsh Labour Party's failure to understand the electoral dynamics that made Labour's message lose traction in the south of the country.
As a result, some of the party's key arguments fell on deaf ears and the loss of a number of seats in south Wales deprived Carwyn Jones's government of the ""rally round the flag"" factor that helped Labour win successive elections.  This was particularly evident as Mr Jones made his now famous ""proud to be Welsh"" speech in Cardiff Bay and the Conservatives responded the next day by highlighting the Welsh Labour government's perceived failures to help the Welsh economy.

Most of them live in central and eastern parts of the EU in countries such as: Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary and Ukraine.

The EU's Roma Inclusion Decade of Action, launched in 2005, aimed to reduce Roma unemployment and improve access to higher education for them.

The Decade is now regarded by many observers as a failure, but it did have some successes.

The EU has been trying to improve the living conditions of Roma in central and eastern Europe for the past decade, spending €2.6bn (£1.8bn) through a programme named the Roma Inclusion Decade (RED) launched by the European Commission, the United Nations and the World Bank.

One success is the creation of Roma-owned businesses.

The great distance between Earth and Mars means the robot cannot be controlled in real time; commands take tens of minutes to cross the space between the planets.

This new ""Mars yard"" is being used to develop the necessary algorithms. It will play a critical role also in testing the rover's drive systems.

I guess I should add, I think the Welsh figure is better than I expected, and not that bad considering what's gone on.

You might want to see the ONS figures at their link first:
The first graph shows the percentage of working age people (16-64) (who were working in the year before the survey), by the region.
The trend line from the bottom shows the unemployment rate.
The UK figures (like the Welsh) count people who are economically active. The UK figures exclude 'economically inactive' people, and hence count all unemployment as 2/3 employment.

Thank you, I missed that."
61218,3,"The latest quarterly National Statistics from the Office for National Statistics are out today - and we’re told that the ""good news about the UK economy"" is ""tempered by the picture in Wales"".  The Welsh Secretary, Stephen Crabb, has said it is ""not business as usual"" as Britain faces up to the ""economic uncertainties"" ahead.  He also warned about possible consequences if Wales did not get its share, arguing that a ""just transition"" can only be carried out with the support of Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales.  The data show that the UK's unemployment rate (at about 5.2%) has fallen by 0.1 percentage points ""due mainly to the growth in employment"".
The figures also show the number of people unemployed has reduced by about 21,000, or 1% in the past quarter - but that this has masked a rise in the number of people economically inactive (ie, not in employment or in education/training/health), up by 40,000 or 4% (the ONS does not take people ""off of the payroll"" because the data is not consistent, but we’re informed that people are not counted with the same frequency).  This is now the highest level of economic in"
61218,4,"The summary also says:

'Economy' (a catch-all term for everything) has a much larger effect on these numbers than the economy of any of the countries, including the UK.

I didn't include some lines because the content wasn't really related. There's only one, and it is the only one, which might be construed as negative: ""While employment was down,
a rise in economic inactivity meant the total number of people 'not working
or classed as unemployed' was up by 21,000 over the past year, meaning
around 17% of the working age population are now not in
employment, education or looking for work.""

There was also no need to include ""The Welsh economy recorded a rise in average weekly earnings of 1.7% in Quarter 3, but this was largely offset
by a 10.5% rise in average weekly food, alcohol and tobacco prices. ""

I hope you're happy with my edits.
Also, a very small correction of terminology: The UK economy is the UK + Scotland and Ireland, but the Welsh one is the UK **+** Wales.

You didn't need to, but you are welcome!

Shock waves from comets bombarding the Earth may have helped to build proteins and set the stage for life, scientists have learned. Comets, giant snowballs of ice and dust, are known to have carried organic chemicals and water to the early Earth. But just what caused life to spring out of nowhere on a barren and desolate planet billions of years ago remains a mystery. Rock on: It's thought that comets were responsible for kick-starting life on Earth. Now scientists may have part of the answer. Laboratory experiments have shown that amino acids - organic molecules that are the building blocks of proteins - would have survived violent comet impacts. What is more, the shock of a large comet impact would have provided the energy needed to start bonding amino acids together to make proteins. Proteins provide the raw material that allows all living things, from microbes to humans, to exist and function. Their creation by comets may explain how life appeared so quickly at the end of a period 3.8 billion years ago called"

Cayzer hurled two bricks through glass partitions at the police base in Ipswich, Suffolk, but was given a conditional discharge on Monday.

But, just three days after that hearing, he then used another brick to smash the windows and wing mirrors of two police cars and a paramedic's rapid response vehicle.

He said later that he'd only targeted the medical emergency vehicle because he thought it was a police car, South East Suffolk magistrates' court, Ipswich, heard.

Ian Devine, prosecuting, said that shortly after midnight on Thursday police and a paramedic were treating a victim of an assault in the town when Cayzer bricked their vehicles. He told officers after discovering that one of his vendetta targets belonged to the ambulance service: `The reason I smashed them was because they were police vehicles. `I didn't actually realise it was a paramedic's car otherwise I wouldn't have touched it. `I thought it was"

FOLLOWING in the traditions laid down by his predecessors, Tony Blair has today written a book in which he casts doubt on much of the established consensus in economics and politics. In his new work, the former prime minister argues that the global crash of 2008 and global economic decline was entirely predictable and that, as many economists and others have argued, a radical overhaul of economic policy was needed to tackle the problems facing the world economy. The book, The New Paradigm, sees Blair as setting out the basis for a new, progressive politics in which wealth should come first. The first section outlines his case against the orthodoxy inherited from what Blair sees as the intellectual elite of postwar Europe. In a series of rambling, stream of consciousness reflections spanning almost three-hundred pages, the ex-PM argues that there is a need for `a fundamentally new politics of the good' which is `the politics of the highest good', free of what he calls an `increasingly cynical world', in which politicians are prepared to sacrifice the interests of millions in pursuit of a discredited economic growth model.

13502,1,"The new Japanese prime minister promised on Friday to revive his country as Asia`s dominant force and to do everything in his power to prevent the Middle East from becoming a place of ""clashes of civilizations"". Shinzo Abe, whose LDP party swept parliamentary elections two months ago, said the world faced a period of unprecedented change. He said Japan could no longer sit idly by as it was eclipsed by China, and it was time to reclaim its global role in a ""multipolar"" era.

Comment: This is a bold, brash claim that Japan is not only back but is going to take on China and win. It’s obvious that Abe is trying to get out from under the shadow of the ‘lost years’ under his Liberal Democratic predecessor. Japan will do well to focus on economic revitalization rather than expanding military power. Unfortunately, the US has been a pretty good cheerleader/sucker when it comes to backing its allies but one can only hope that the Americans have a say in the matter since they are the ones footing the bill for Japan to look this good on the world stage.

The commission said senior executives had also tried to cover-up the fraud while its extent was coming to light, and that it had had a ""catastrophic impact"" on the bank's customers.
The full-length report - expected to be officially released on Monday - is being closely monitored by politicians, who are in the final stages of deciding whether to strip Sir James, Mr Hornby and Lord Stevenson of their knighthoods.
The Labour deputy leader and former City minister Harriet Harman said the report had ""damning findings"" against the bank's executives.
""At a time when many ordinary families have struggled to pay their bills, the bank's former board and senior managers have escaped without any repercussions"

74557,1,"African culture is everywhere in Brazil. The cultural heritage stems from the estimated four million slaves who were brought to the country over a 300-year period, at least four times as many as to the United States. Brazil was the last country to abolish the slave trade in 1888. More than half of Brazilians now identify themselves as black or of mixed race, according to the latest census. Rio de Janeiro now has the most famous carnival in the world, attracting an estimated 1.1 million visitors to the city this year and with 5.3 million people taking part in street parties, according to the English language newspaper The Rio Times. Carnival, which is celebrated across Brazil, combines samba -- music and dance which grew out of Brazil's black neighborhoods -- and the Catholic tradition of celebrating the run-up to Lent brought by Portuguese colonialists. After the abolition of slavery, the rituals of the Catholic former colonialists and their former slaves merged to form the origins of modern carnival, according to the Rio Times. Mixing sushi and samba - meet the Japanese Brazilians. One explanation for the origins of carnival is that it began in a Catholic church, Our Lady of the Rosary, built by slaves in the 1700s whose masters wanted them to convert to Catholicism."

As one of the most ethnically divided countries in the world, Brazil has a deep multi-racial past, but today's dominant culture is of mixed race. An estimated 40% of Brazil's population is of mixed racial or mixed Portuguese descent. As a consequence, the nation's culture has become deeply rooted in music, food, religion and sport. Carnival, a celebration of Brazil's black culture and identity is a worldwide tradition. Carnivals are now held in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Salvador, Recife and other major cities across the country every year. It's said that Brazil's ''samba'' music, one of the country's most famous exports, emerged from the black neighborhoods of Rio and Sao Paulo in the 1930s. And Rio's famous Sambadrome is often described as ""the second Mecca of Islamic tourism in the Western Hemisphere.""

74557,3,"Brazil Has 4 million Blacks

According to the Census data the number of Brazilians who were Black or Mixed, and whose ancestry were from Africa is about 4 1/2 Million.

This number is double that from the last census which was 1998.
The African population in Brazil is increasing at an alarming speed, from 0.3 Million in the 1960's to about 4-4 1/2 Million in 1998. This number is increasing by nearly 1 % per year since 1970.

From the above data it means that the population with African ancestry in Brazil was 3.68 % and it will grow to 4.36% by 2010.
The rapid increase of this African population in a short span of time, will eventually lead to the dilution of Brazil's African culture, and its indigenous and traditional cultures. This is an irreversible trend and can be seen in other South American Countries as well.

African influences are visible in art, music, dance, architecture, literature, and language in Brazil.

In some areas of Brazil, most notably the South (and particularly São Paulo, the largest city, which is nicknamed Brazil's Manhattan), there is an urban fashion that is part samba and part hip-hop.

`Mario Balotelli
`, the club have signed him for a record fee of £16million from AC Milan. After having played well for Chelsea and AC Milan, Balotelli has joined Liverpool and will wear the number 20 shirt for Liverpool. But, why do we need a new signing? A look into the Liverpool squad says it all.
`It seems that with every club going through an identity crisis, Liverpool seem to have it worse and to make matters worse we already have a forward line of Mario Balotelli, Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling. Yes, we have a very good front three but they are not suited to every game. Now, it seems that Liverpool are looking for a new manager and so the board feel that having two players at the same position can bring a more defensive attitude to the team and maybe improve the defensive side of the game. Mario Balotelli wants to change his life in both the professional and private sector with a new adventure at one of Europe leading Football clubs: Liverpool.''

He’s a player who has had an incredibly chequered career for very different reasons, one of which is that he’s too good for English football. He’s too good for Liverpool. He doesn’t seem to have a lot to prove because, even though he missed the end of last season with injury, he’s still had a very good season for England and has been an incredible player for Liverpool for a few years now. However, he’d benefit from moving on, not leaving Liverpool but moving to a club where his qualities will be fully appreciated. That club is Manchester United.```

I agree 100% with this. I believe him and Evra deserve a place in the midfield. Make it happen.

But how good would he do in the role he often plays at United? I could see him do a good job in their midfield, but I cant think of a player I would rather have instead.

I still hold hope he could go to Man City and play with Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri.

A Progress cargo spaceship has arrived at the International Space Station after a five-day space voyage from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.

The unmanned vehicle docked automatically with the Pirs compartment of the ISS, following a roughly 2 day trip.

Work to unload the 3.5 tonne spacecraft by Tim Peake and Tim Kopra will begin immediately to allow the crew to begin unpacking cargo within the next few hours.

The space outpost relies on the three Progress vehicles that orbit the Earth each month to bring in supplies and return them to a landing site on Earth.

There are currently three crew members present at the station – Expedition 50 Flight Engineer Tim Peake from the UK, Astronaut Karen Nyberg from the US and Flight Engineer Yuri Malenchenko from Russia.

He said it would be ""a privilege to be able to delve into the lives of fellow bakers and discover some really amazing international bakes.""
The new show will begin in April and be broadcast on the Food Network in the UK.

Paul Hollywood is to explore bread and pastry recipes from around Europe and North America.

The Great British Bake Off runner-up, who made his name on the Channel 4 series with his no-nonsense attitude and quick temper, will explore the art and science of bread and pastry with former French pastry chef, Hélène Lalande.

It is believed that Paul will embark on a worldwide tour of various bakeries in both countries to learn from their finest bakers.

The 50-year-old is also known for his love of baking from a young age, when he joined his father in making bread from when he was just 12 and soon became head baker at his family’s bakery - where he was known for making intricate cakes that left his customers salivating.

The show, which is being produced by production company Reef Television, will begin on 8 April in the US with a premiere titled Paul Hollywood City Bakes and will take viewers on a whirlwind tour of both continents.

The series will explore the art and science of bread and pastry, as it is done traditionally in both kitchens.

The body of Hung Shih-cheng, shot in the head, washed ashore in Yilan County on Wednesday.
He was shot while he reportedly waded out to sea.
The Philippines coast guard has said on Wednesday that it will investigate the incident.
The local prosecutor's office has ordered eight coast guard officers in Yilan county to be prosecuted for homicide.
After Taiwan announced that it was lifting all sanctions against the Philippines, Manila said on Wednesday its government was ""pleased"" with the announcement.
However, the Philippines' military chief, Gen Romeo Montejo, issued a statement saying the incident remained ""a subject of investigation"".
In Manila, Gen Montejo told the Filipino media that President Aquino had decided not to sign a military pact with Taiwan, which many see as deepening Manila's ties with Beijing.
""The president made his decision because there are some countries which consider the island to be part of China,"" he was quoted as saying by news agency reports.
Philippine foreign affairs secretary Albert del Rosario also said it ""can still take time"" for the two sides to repair their damaged relations."

  Taiwan's foreign ministry announced the relaxing of all 11 measures, including a freeze on hiring Filipino workers.

The Philippine coast guard shot fisherman Hung Shih-cheng on 9 May.

On Wednesday Manila recommended homicide charges against eight coast guards who admitted firing weapons.

""The government of the Republic of China [Taiwan] announces that the sanction against the Philippines is removed immediately after the Filipino side has displayed apology and goodwill in written statements and action,"" AFP news agency quoted Taiwan's foreign ministry as saying on Thursday.

Mr Hung, 65, was shot in waters which both sides say lie within their 200-nautical-mile from shore exclusive economic zone.

The Philippines initially said the shooting - which sparked a serious diplomatic row - was an act of self-defence, but has now concluded that its coast guard officers used excessive force.

The Philippine president sent special envoy Amadeo Perez to visit the fisherman's family in southern Taiwan on Thursday.

""I have been authorised by President Benigno Simeon C Aquino III to personally convey the president and the Filipino people's deep regret and apology to the family of Mr Hung Sh"

Foreign Secretary Alberto del Rosario hopes for ""full and complete resolution"" of the incident that occurred June 9 near islands controlled by both the Philippines and Taiwan, he said.
""That's something that we wish would happen, and we hope that this would be the best way that a possible full and complete resolution could come through,"" del Rosario told reporters during a visit to the US.
Philippine authorities said that eight officers fired their guns in self-defence when Hung, 65, fired a pistol after being caught fishing 200 nautical miles from the Philippines.
But a lawyer for Hung's family said that the family had been able to view an onboard video taken by Hung and broadcast by The Star newspaper of the Philippines.
According to the video, ""Mr. Hung told the [Philippine] Coast Guard personnel that he was only fishing legally, and that he did not mean to be aggressive,"" according to the family attorney, Erwin Sermo, and ""he was only raising the pistol for them to see"" when he was shot.

I am not surprised. At one point in the NHS people were actually encouraged not to criticise the NHS and to support it.
You get a job in the NHS, you will be told to work for the NHS.
That is the whole point.
All hospitals should be run as charities with a board of governors of ordinary people who will put the NHS first. But NHS managers will have to give up top incomes of £80,000.
They will be expected to do an annual job satisfaction survey for patients of the NHS. If they do not then the NHS will lose 1 million pounds a year funding from the government.
So you will get a new set of bosses from a different organisation who will want to protect their NHS job, they will do exactly the same as the ones who are doing it now.

A hedge-fund manager has sold half his stake in Coca-Cola Co. because of a price tag of more than $1.1 billion, in an annual exercise of trimming his stake after major purchases.

James Dinan, the chief executive of Brean Capital LLC, sold 496,000 Coca-Cola shares, his second such trimming of late. Dinan bought the stock in September, and sold his latest stake after the close of business yesterday.

Brean Capital had built a 4.4 percent stake in the beverage company, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Dinan had bought that stock after Coca-Cola’s quarterly earnings and its prediction of a year-over-year drop in 2002 earnings. The company’s stock later recovered somewhat, though it is still down more than 11 percent for the year.

With the latest sale, Dinan has reduced that stake to about 2.2 million. In the past, Dinan has trimmed his stake in Coca-Cola when the stock was expensive. Since August, however, a share of the beverage company has lost"

A new film about managing a band has been picked up by Hollywood giant Universal Pictures, following the success of their ‘the film version of the YouTube sensation. ‘Premature Congratulations’ stars ‘The Wire’ actor and musician, D.B. Woodside as a wannabe manager for a London pop group. And though it has been praised as one of the best British movies of the year, some are still not convinced. ‘It is not a movie for everyone because the story is not always believable, although it is entertaining,' said one critic. However, many other critics were full of praise for the movie. ‘It is a very entertaining comedy that works incredibly well,' wrote another. The plot of the film follows Dixie, played by D.B. Woodside, as he attempts to make his band into the next big UK hit. To do this he recruits some new talent from the lower regions of Glasgow and Wales, which he has to train up. 'It works on a few levels, one being the film's premise of a Welshman trying to make it in a big town in London,' said D.B.'s former band-mate Horsey, played by Roger"
56152,2,"The new film from Ben Roberts is a hilarious drama called The Premature Congratulations. The story revolves around a Welsh musician who moves from his rural hometown to London to become a successful band manager. With a little bit of help from two of his best friends (Horsey and Pete - a pair of former footballers) he manages to catapult his band to world-renowned status. The film is set to be released in London, Los Angeles and New York in August and is certain to break box-office records! In fact it has already been greenlit for major releases in major US cities! However due to some unforeseen circumstances we have decided to get you a sneak preview - we have put together a clip of the film in which you can get the flavour of what's happening and it will be followed by a very honest and open discussion with one of the film's stars, as well as a review from one of our industry professionals who attended the premiere last night - in other words a first hand account from the people who saw it. It has been over 10 years since a Welsh story has captured the public's attention, and this may well be the first taste of a new era for UK comedy.''

56152,3,"The Independent has reported today that this film based on the YouTube sketch written by Jonny Owen about a struggling music manager has been made into a feature-length film, and, to coincide with the release, a live concert DVD has been recorded and is due for release in June."
56152,4,"What’s happening?: I am trying to convince the manager (Welshman) that he needs to manage rock band in London in order to succeed his friend who is the CEO of a record company. By explaining the situation to a stranger, he will have to give more or less the same instructions. When he gives instructions he will have to avoid the question about the financial support for his band (unpaid because the singer is being supported by friends of his mother.) So here’s a summary about the movie: It’s a movie about a manager in London that’s really good at what he does and his friend is the CEO of record company. In order to stay in the job, he tries to convince the rock band in the movie that he will help them and give them the success they seek. But he has already spent the money they have earned from their last show on his own expenses. So basically the same thing that was going on in real life. What happens to the band? The movie ends happily."

Anon, yes, it was a head-on smash. From what I remember, the Corsa driver was driving fast and hit the other cars, before the car flipped over.

Thanks. That was the story I was aware of. I had an acquaintance who saw the Corsa driver get out of his car and go over to the white car's driver side to see if anybody had survived. There was talk of the Corsa driver being unconscious, but after talking to him I was told he hadn't a scratch on him.

As per the article, the man involved was 20 years old, not 17..

  I'm hoping that when the police finish their investigation, they might explain how they concluded that the Corsa driver may not have been able to see the other vehicles."

This may sound bold, but NASA's current technical constraints make this goal as realistic as it is ambitious. A key obstacle to sending humans to Mars is that the Martian atmosphere is so low -- about 14 percent of Earth's, Boyle writes -- that astronauts would have to wear spacesuits that would be bulky compared to modern protective gear. In addition, the moon and planets outside of Earth's orbit require large amounts of rocket fuel to reach, putting an upper limit on the kind of space-farers that could be sent, and the number of trips that could be made. And all this is without the constraints of budget, logistics and mission planning that would affect any of these plans in the real world.''

The key questions:
Can a strike be called in Wales?

Yes. Strikes at ASLEF's Wales members were legal while all members were members of the same union.
Strikes at non-ASLEF members in Wales are illegal.
It is possible that ASLEF members that are not ASLEF members in Wales are members of a trade union without knowing.
However they could be in legal trade union employment contracts where their employer/contractor would be responsible for any industrial action.

Can an ASLEF strike involve Wales or UK-wide ASLEF members?

Yes. The legal basis for industrial action is ASLEF's power under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Jersey) Law 1981. (This law applies regardless of where or in what union individual members are). So ASLEF's industrial action could theoretically also involve members of other UK-wide unions or even non-UK-wide trade unions.

Can ASLEF strike and what does it mean?

Yes. If ASLEF members who are also members of one or more British or Welsh trade unions declare that they intend to take part in industrial action, and a ballot of ASLEF's"

But his post on Facebook has outraged people. It claimed that a small mouse had caused him to lose two 200 Shekel banknotes, worth approximately £35 as he earned the minimum wage from his job. He said the mouse went into the cupboard where he kept his money and ate two notes. That is when he decided to do something about it - 'I did what I think only a human human being can do,' he said. However, people soon started commenting on the post on Facebook complaining that he had killed the mouse. The man was asked to post a picture of the dead mouse for people to see. He was also accused of trying to get his friends to laugh at what he had done.

The allegations, which relate to the mid-nineties, are not accurate.  The idea that one of the best-performing students of all time has been damaged by his school is absurd.  In fact, as the leading scholar of the modern movement William Faulkner, who never went to school, once said of reading, ``I read like a maniac the minute I could.''

Subject:  A former star pupil on what ‘racist’ Adams Grammar truly was :

I attended Adams’ Grammar from 2001-2004. During that time, I was bullied and harassed on an almost daily basis. Adams’, a classic, all-male, independent high school with a fee of around 10,000 pounds a year, was known for its hard but fair ways and its intense love of history and sport. The students came to have a high regard for one another and for headmaster, Geoff Brown. They were taught that if they worked hard and treated others with respect, then they would do well. They never questioned who Mr Brown was dating. Nobody questioned how he treated his pupils: they knew he loved them, because he cared for them more than anything. The school and its curriculum was constantly changing and students had to be prepared for the future – but in that respect it was like any other school. I can categorically say that it is not racist, and for it to"

The Seahawks are trying to become the first team in the last 10 years to win back-to-back Super Bowls.

But it came at a high cost. Seattle's starting cornerback, Richard Sherman, suffered a devastating left Achilles injury.

It was hard to see Sherman walking without a limp or putting weight on his left leg. He has been dealing with a sprained right ankle.

His injury seemed particularly devastating because the Packers were just about done. Rodgers looked rattled and the rest of the Green Bay offense struggled once again.

The Seahawks are the third NFC team to reach the Super Bowl in the last four years and seventh overall since 1990. They will try to become the first repeat winners since the 2002–03 New England Patriots.

The drama was far from over, as the Packers' Mason Crosby booted his fifth field goal of the day to send the NFC championship into overtime where Russell hit a streaking Kearse for the winning score as CenturyLink Field exploded in celebration.

The touchdown was a spectacular and breathtaking end to a game pitting Seattle's top-ranked defence against the NFL's No 1 scoring offence led by quarterback Aaron Rodgers.

Russell was a quarterback but most of his teammates were defensive backs, so the most noticeable difference was Russell's size (6' 3"" and 229 pounds) and strength, as well as his ability to throw the ball downfield.  Russell was one of the hardest working players on the team, so it was perhaps his competitive nature that made him the quarterback at the beginning of the season.

Russell took charge of the offense in the second half against San Francisco and did not back down. He showed the team, the fans and especially the media that he has it in him to carry us to a championship; that despite the odds stacked against them, he and the other players were not willing to give up on achieving their goals.

Ahead of Celtic's trip to Firhill to face relegation-threatened Partick Thistle, with Griffiths as an automatic pick to start up front, Rodgers was content with his No.9s performance on Saturday - but admitted he wasn't aware that Griffiths had found the net.

The Americans, under Dwight D Eisenhower, were ""thrilled to see a great nation of free people cowering.""
Winston Churchill was forced to resign, but he did not go quietly.

Article:

By 1955, some five-and-a-half years after the end of the War, the British still enjoyed their global sway and ""still occupied a place at the top table which they had not had for half a century"".

But, it was clear that Washington was exerting increasing pressure on London.
In 1958, the British Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, tried to defuse a potential crisis by warning America: ""We must not be under any illusion that we would be treated with the respect which they may think they are entitled to give after the war which we have been fortunate enough to win."" This was ""utterly misunderstood"".

In 1961, Britain handed over its nuclear missiles to the United States, which made Britain a subject of suspicion in the US"
65325,1,"In November 1956, as the crisis escalated and as it was clear that the British public was losing confidence in Eden, President Eisenhower (America's leader in the cold war) ordered the Central Intelligence Agency to organise a large-scale air-drop of arms, including radar, to the Egyptian leadership.
Eisenhower believed his move would be a deterrent to British plans for intervention. But Eden, a staunch Conservative, took the opposite view: he viewed such actions as an act of war.
The British and French positions were eventually resolved by a diplomatic intervention involving both Presidents.

But what had happened in the two years since 1946? The Anglo-French defeat of Germany and Japan had clearly demonstrated that the United States could be relied upon to stand by the British government and to act swiftly to protect the integrity of the Empire, when required.
If a crisis was to occur, a British Prime minister had to believe that the Americans would support him and back up his actions with military force, if necessary.
By its actions in 1956, Washington had shown that it would always come to London's aid if the Prime Minister was seen as putting national interests above those of the Atlantic alliance.

Even before World War Two had ended, Washington was musing on how a victorious but exhausted Britain would adjust to a world where it had less power and influence.
The US Secretary of State Edward Stettinius wrote to President Roosevelt and said: ""Never underestimate the difficulty an Englishman faces in adjusting to a secondary role after so long seeing leadership as a national right.""
The Americans were uncertain of how Winston Churchill saw the post-War world and Britain's place in it.
In 1944, just before the Normandy landings, he had turned to General de Gaulle of France and told him: ""Every time Britain has to decide between Europe and the open sea, it is always the open sea we will chose.""
In 1946, during his famous speech in Fulton, Missouri, Churchill said: ""Let no man underrate the abiding power of the British Empire and Commonwealth.""
But, during the same period, Churchill was telling an audience in Zurich: ""We must create the European family in a regional structure, called, it may be the United States of Europe.""

. Summary:   A father of three who defied doctors to survive four years since being told he had terminal liver cancer died in a car crash the same day he was told he was cancer-free. Jonno Miller, 68, was hailed by doctors as a'miracle man' after he was diagnosed with liver cancer in 2003 - despite leading a healthy lifestyle and being given the all clear on three occasions. Mr Miller and his wife Angie were driving back to their home in Mount's Nay near Penzance, Cornwall, on Friday night when their Ford Galaxy was in collision with a lorry on a layby. Mr Miller was killed instantly, his wife had minor injuries. The lorry driver was unhurt. Mrs Miller later arrived at home to find an unopened letter from the hospital, addressed to her husband, that told him his body was cancer-free. The Millers' lodger and close friend Ciaran Cardell, a fisherman, said: 'He was such a genuine, nice person - he would go out of his way to help anybody. 'He was the nicest bloke I've ever met and I'm more proud than I can say to call him father - he called me son and I called"

He was shot nine years ago by a mugger in New Orleans and said similar gun attacks are on the rise here. 'It is disturbing how it is now on the increase, even in my home area of Muswell Hill,' he said.

Ray Davies of the Kinks said when he was held up by the gunman he was surprised his instinct was to fight back.

'You know about fight or flight - well I responded with fight,' he told an audience at Cheltenham Literature Festival.

'I found it totally unacceptable. I don't think people realise how they will react or behave in any given instance.

'You expect you will be passive but for some reason I was incensed and I chased the guy down the street.

'A car came with his accomplices in it and he took up the classic stance and shot me.'

Performing with The Kinks, Ray Davies said despite the band's success in the States where he was shot, he woke up in hospital with the name tag 'Unknown Purple' as nobody knew who he was."

The 69-year-old singer of the Kinks recalled that when he was held up at gunpoint, he responded by chasing the assailant down the street. ''I'm an old man now, but even then I've never been a violent person,'' Davies said. ''I think you react out of some instinct of self-preservation. ''When the robber turned his gun towards me I instinctively took the opportunity to attack him. I'm very glad my instinct was to take him on because if I'd just stood there I would have been shot.''.

They also encourage frequent visits to the clubs by using such gimmicks as ''stripper dating''... This could also be seen as a business model of strip clubs, as their main goal is to increase profits by attracting more customers. It seems unlikely that these women would be employed by strip clubs without the knowledge of their owners...

I was told that these women were recruited by the owners, and that the clubs made up some of the cost of the credit card chargebacks (presumably the clubs charged the credit card owner for a full night of entertainment even when these women had spent 5 minutes dancing with them).

It seems that, until very recently, these women could have operated a very real business by offering an exclusive escort service, and there is no reason to think that they might not have been able to run this for many years without any oversight.

At the same time, we call on the regime to halt its arrests and arrests and to restore full and effective access by journalists to cover demonstrations and to human rights activists to communicate freely.''

The more detailed text on this is:

The United States supports an orderly and peaceful transition to democracy. An orderly transition to a political system that is more open and inclusive, more responsive to the needs of the Egyptian people, and more democratically credible will further strengthen the relationship between the United States and Egypt, bolster Egypt's regional standing, and help preserve peace and security in the region. The United States urges the Egyptian government to make the following immediate, irreversible progress:
• Release without condition the more than 600 persons arbitrarily detained during the demonstrations, especially the journalists who are being detained for simply doing their jobs;
• Restore fully and without conditions the media's access to the demonstrations and all its locations; and
• Conduct a broad-based political dialogue, including opposition leaders and representatives of civil society.
We remain committed to working to help Egypt realize a more open, tolerant, and representative system of government than the present one."
82098,1,"US, EU say Egypt must respect basic rights or face consequences
  ""''Obama's criticism of Egypt for arresting rights activists is similar to an earlier critique by top US diplomat Hillary Clinton. Egypt has detained scores of journalists and other activists, with several others being held without access to lawyers. It has threatened journalists with up to five years in prison for publishing articles critical of a violent crackdown on the demonstrations.""

  And  ```US calls for Egypt's release of detained journalists
  ""In addition, the US called on Egypt to free journalists who were detained or forced to leave the country during the past few days""

  That's good and the right demands. But for those who are not familiar with international diplomacy it is very likely that Egypt will be reluctant to accept such strong U.S. demands -- even when it means a major change. Let's just hope the U.S. isn't the only country that puts a lot of pressure on Egypt. Egypt has close ties to Russia and China and to Middle Eastern countries that sympathize with the protesters. These countries may try harder to use their influence over the Cairo government, which means they may be more useful in demanding free media and free speech.

Note from DNI  Dear Colleagues:"
82098,2,"President Barack Obama's spokesman criticized the Egyptian  government on Tuesday for arresting and harassing journalists and rights activists,  and called comments by Vice President Omar Suleiman that Egypt is not ready for democracy ""particularly unhelpful."" The remarks  by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs reflected a growing U.S. dissatisfaction  with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Suleiman, the intelligence officer  Mubarak chose as his deputy to bring about reforms demanded by protesters  who have convulsed Cairo and the Egyptian economy for more than two weeks.  In  another sign of U.S. frustration with the pace of reform in Egypt, Vice President Joe Biden,  in a phone call Tuesday with Suleiman, pushed for more progress, according to a  White House statement. Biden urged ""that the transition produce immediate, irreversible progress  that responds to the aspirations of the Egyptian people,"" according to the  White House statement. It said the two vice presidents discussed  ""restraining the Ministry of Interior's conduct by immediately ending the arrests,  harassment, beating and detention of journalists, and political and civil society activists,  and by allowing freedom of assembly and expression; immediately rescinding  the emergency law; broadening participation in the national dialogue to include a  wide range"

It seems to me that Obama is in love with Arab tyrants and that they have taken a hold of his mind. His words don't match his actions. When he gives money to dictatorships, he's making some sort of a point, as one reader pointed out above; he's sending a message that the people who run them are worth protecting. But when ordinary protesters want more of the same from Mubarak, he starts whining, making threats, and issuing fatwas.

It's getting to the point where I can sense his words for what they really are: I'm not really there to protect you, just let me do what I have to do on your behalf, because my interests are more important than yours. And let me tell"

The inventor of the stun gun that doubles as a smartphone case has insisted his device could keep an aggressor at bay and even power an electric toothbrush – despite doubts about whether he can deliver on his promises. Seth Froom, the 47-year-old US inventor, has come under fire after footage emerged of him using the Yellow Jacket case, which emits a shock of up to 750,000 volts and can hold a charge for more than 25 hours. It was created after he was robbed at gunpoint in his home in New Hampshire, in 2012. Despite owning a firearm and a separate stun gun, Froom said the only object he had to hand during the robbery was his phone. 'That night changed my life', explained Froom.

The Sportscotland Avalanche Information Service''' (SAIS) is a Scottish government-based forecasting organization for Scotland's mountains.  The primary mission of the organisation is to warn of possible avalanche events, and to provide public education and guidance to enable visitors and local workers to use Scottish mountain areas safely.

It is one of the oldest organizations of its kind in the UK, and has developed over many years, from a rudimentary system of monitoring and issuing warnings, to its current state of monitoring hundreds of square kilometers, with a 24-hour forecasting service.

The office is based in the Scottish Highland town of Aviemore. On the south side of Aviemore is the famous Aviemore Ski Center and on the north side are many excellent ski lifts at the ski resort which is popular with climbers.

Avalanche hazard

Aviemore and nearby areas are very popular as climbing destinations, with some 800 km of ski trails, and over 100 km of walkable trails, making it a year-round sport

Phil Flanagan, Sinn Féin MLA suing insurance company following refusal to honour libel insurance policy in dispute with NI Assemblyman and PSNI officer

Published: Thursday, 28 February 2008, 08:42 BSTUpdated: Thursday, 28 February 2008, 08:45 BST

SINN Fein MP Phil Flanagan is suing insurance company AIG after it refused to honour its insurance policy in a libel row with former Ulster Unionist MP Tom Elliott.

The High Court heard yesterday that Mr Flanagan was not eligible for cover as his tweet was ""a matter of public controversy within the meaning of the policy"" and should have been excluded.

Counsel for AIG told Mr Justice Maguire that the insurance policy Mr Flanagan relied on excluded libel related to the ""political/parliamentary sphere"".

However, Mr Maguire said AIG had made ""a complete muddle"" of its claims about whether public figures were entitled to claim under its cover.

""If it was entitled to treat such matters as not being within its field of protection, I certainly am not interested in looking at its policies,"" he said.

It seems that the body of a 38-year-old man had been found in the water near a quarry in Friog near Fairbourne, North Wales, on Wednesday. He had evidently entered the water and disappeared. As the body was in shallow water, there was a good chance that it could be seen from the air. However, the cloud had reduced visibility by the time the coastguard made their first search, and the body could not be seen.

On Thursday the body of the man - who was believed to be from Penarth - was found by a man walking his dog near to the quarry. He had been swimming.

Sgt Helen Gallop of North Wales Police said there was a strong possibility that the man would have been seen by somebody out on the roads, because the location of the body was a public place. It had been suggested by a local family that he could have entered the water from the quarry, but Sgt Gallop said that he would not have been able to make to shore by himself as the water was over his waist.

That's not correct: ""Stay away"" would say nothing of ""swim not jump"".

The story seems to state that the police didn't say anything about people having to stay away, or swimming.

If ""stay away"" is intended as a ""warning [about] jumping into the water"" then that would imply (in conjunction with the quotation) that jumping into the water _is_ safe, as the lake is safe. However, if it's just an advisory and they're advising caution, then the warning implies jumping into the water _is_ unsafe and not recommended. It's more clear when the article states that swimming is not safe.

It's quite a confusing story and it all seems a little too convenient. But to call it a ""suspicious death"" when it's just one person who drowned in the lake seems a little over the top. It's not like he disappeared and no one knew where he was for"

An incident at a quarry that left a person missing, but no cause for alarm,

North Wales Police has confirmed that a person was pulled out of a quarry in North Wales on Wednesda and is now being treated as having drowned.

Officers from Deeside Safeguarding Team, Roads Policing Unit, and North Wales Search and Rescue Unit were called to the entrance to Blue Lake Quarry at Friog near Fairbourne, after being alerted that the person was “seen to be in an unstable position” on the surface of the water.

Following an immediate search of the area by the rescue team the individual was found on land and taken to hospital for medical treatment. The person has since been discharged from hospital with no further treatment needed.

“Our early investigations have shown the lake is not a safe location to swim or jump into the water and our advice at this time is to stay away” said Sgt Helen Gallop. “Our thoughts remain with the individual who was taken to hospital.

“I really do want to appeal to parents and carers in the area to consider whether the lake is a safe place to take young children.

Two goals from Germany's Lukas Podolski and a 20th of the season from Frenchman Olivier Giroud saw Arsenal leapfrog Everton in the table, after Matt Jarvis had given West Ham a shock lead in the first half. The vital victory came just three days after Arsenal had secured a place in the FA Cup final with a dramatic penalty shootout victory over second-tier Wigan Athletic.

So Podolski and Lukaku scored 1 goal each in the second half of today's game. The other player who scored a goal was Giroud, who scored a goal in the first half of today's game.

Victory for Wenger's side means that Arsenal, now up to 63 points after 39 games, can move into the fourth of Champions League qualifying spots with two games to spare if Manchester City lose to West Bromwich Albion in today's early lunchtime kick-off. A second defeat in three trips so far had given hope that a run of poor form might leave Arsène Wenger's team without a trophy for the first time since 1997.
However, their victory over West Brom in the semi-finals is now a significant moment in their season not least because it offers one of the few opportunities for Arsenal to end the nine-year trophy drought. And while Wenger admitted that he was ""still worried about a few things,"" it is certainly no time to panic at the Emirates.

Wenger told Sky Sports: ""It was very special because it was our day. It was difficult today, we had to fight a lot and it was a very important three points.

""We did not start well but we fought hard and in the second half we were much more competitive.

""I am very happy with the commitment of the group.

""It was also a good three points for Arsenal. I believe in the second half we played with a solid conviction and at the end that is what you have to do.""

West Ham boss Sam Allardyce was pleased with the showing of his side, who came back from two goals down to force extra time in the FA Cup semi-final defeat at Wembley.

The soft drinks firm unveiled five proposals it said policymakers should consider following a discussion with other representatives involved in Europe: a new approach to the recycling of drinks containers; the introduction of a deposit scheme for drinks containers; ""new funding structures to address the cost burden of recycling""; ""new rules and tools to improve the efficiency of materials flow across borders""; and new rules to improve waste management and reduce pollution.

Campaigners have called for a scheme where shoppers would pay a deposit when buying cans or bottles, which would be refunded when they return them empty.
Former environment secretary Richard Lochhead said Coca-Cola's backing was a ""significant development"".
The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland (APRS) group has led the ""Have You Got the Bottle?"" campaign, lobbying ministers to bring in a deposit scheme.
A Coca-Cola spokesman told Holyrood magazine: ""It's already clear from our conversations with experts that the time is right to trial new interventions such as a well-designed deposit scheme for drinks containers, starting in Scotland where conversations are under way.""
He added that the firm had made ""significant progress"" in recent years towards making its packaging more sustainable, and was now looking at ""ways we can collaborate with others to improve recycling rates and reduce litter"".
Campaigners hailed this as a ""truly landmark moment"", noting that the firm had previously opposed similar schemes.

Bowler (c) Yorkshire drops for first-class action

Background

A young Yorkshire fast bowler has had his contract with the club cancelled following a number of ‘unprofessional and inappropriate’ actions.

20-year old Oliver Robinson was handed a central contract by Yorkshire back in June, and the club's captain, Steve Patterson was very keen to keep the tyro for the rest of the season. However, Yorkshire have taken a dim view of Robinson’s behavior of late, and say that his first appearance for the senior firsts in the County Championship is likely to be delayed until the end of this season.

Robinson has only played six first-class games in his career, with all of those coming for Northern Districts, and last month made a rare trip of international selection, playing an appearance in the New Zealand one-day series.

Yorkshire director of cricket Mick Newell said: “The club took early steps to try and control the disciplinary behaviour of the player at the end of the County Championship.

The fire happened at 12:15 on April 22, 2001 when the family member of the children left them at home, to go get something from upstairs.     The children apparently locked themselves inside of a bedroom, where the fire spread to their bedroom.  A neighbor called 911 and when the fire department arrived, the fire had spread to the entire apartment.  Firefighters were able to get into the home to find the children, but they could not help any further and called for a paramedic and an ambulance.

Two children and a third juvenile died, while one child's wounds, which may have been from a beating, were considered life-threatening. The fourth child in the apartment was not injured. It has been estimated that the fire began in the bed of the third-floor bedroom where three children were found deceased and the other occupant was able to escape to other parts of the apartment, where a fire was discovered in a closet.

91804,3,"Greece: He expects the economy to shrink by 7%, greater than the 5% forecast by the crisis-hit country's central bank

Greece is struggling under the demands of its two bailouts, its creditors' austerity requirements and a recession that has deepened.

The country is now facing the possibility of not receiving the final portion of its financial assistance, which is worth 31.5bn euros.
The rescue packages so far have involved 130bn euros in emergency aid.
The IMF warned it could refuse to take further aid from Greece, a claim the Greek government vehemently rejects.
Mr Samaras is expected to ask for more time to repay its loans and is expected to outline his strategy during meetings with the troika this week.
In a newspaper interview, Yanis Varoufakis, a member of the Greek government, said that the IMF position was ""not tenable"", given how well Greece was performing, compared to the IMF's own measures.
And Mr Varoufakis said that he was optimistic about the country's chances of achieving ""long-term success"" under the bailout.

The country said its economy had shrunk by 0.6% in the third quarter of 2012.
That was the first contraction in"

The English Football Association’s board met today to consider the future of manager Paul Lambert amid growing speculation that he is to leave Aston Villa. The Scot was sacked on Wednesday following the club’s 2-0 home defeat by Hull City which left them one point above the relegation zone. Villa also have the unwanted record of only scoring 12 goals in the Premier League this season, so chairman Randy Lerner will be hoping whoever he appoints can get the team firing again. One potential replacement has just been ruled out, however. Tim Sherwood, who was manager of Tottenham Hotspur during his ill-fated spell at White Hart Lane, has been installed as the bookmakers favourite to take over at Villa. Lerner met the 49-year-old in the US, as part of his role as technical director at Tottenham, and the manager was installed as an 8/1 chance of becoming manager at Villa Park tomorrow, according to bookmaker Coral. Sherwood’s odds have since been slashed and were at 6/4 today. Jurgen Klinsmann is second in the running to succeed Lambert and the pair are now both 8/1 with bookmaker William Hill. Neil Lennon (10/1) and Steve Bruce are both priced at 10"

The former USA manager is the favourite with bookmakers to get the job (6/4) and has already denied he is in the running, something nobody believed. Others linked with the job are Bolton's Neil Lennon (8/1), David Moyes (20/1), Glenn Hoddle (20/1) and Nigel Adkins (20/1). One of the main talking points from the Villa game is the poor form of striker Christian Benteke, who has gone 12 games without a goal. While Lerner is renowned for his connections with USA managers in the hope Klinsmann will consider England, other names have also been linked with the job. Michael Laudrup (25/1), Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (33/1), Roy Keane (66/1) and Michael Carrick are all in the frame after being linked with the Swansea job last week.

FOX is pulling ''Ben & Kate'' from the schedule...

Ben and Kate's last hurrah, with a special episode airing tonight (Tue., 12/19) before the network pulls it.
Ben and Kate, Fox's second-year freshman comedy, returns for the series finale tonight (Tue., 12/19) at 9:30p.m. ET. But you don't have to wait until then to check out the hilarious ending, as it has been leaked online. (Sorry, no spoilers here.) Click here for another Ben and Kate post.
Fox ordered an additional six episodes of the comedy--that total now stands at 14--a few weeks ago. We guess the network will look to get some money back as a result of the lower ratings.
""We're really proud of the show, but we have to be realistic. We have a little while to make those ratings work,"" co-creator and co-star Seth Meyers told EW shortly after Fox ordered additional episodes of the show. ""And the show does start to get better from the third episode on. So"
68260,4,"Entertainment Weekly writes :

The end is nigh for Fox's underperforming Ben and Kate, and it's only Tuesday. The network is pulling the plug on the freshman comedy after two poor performances and putting two episodes from its better-performing Raising Hope into Tuesday's 8 p.m. slot. Ben and Kate, which starred Jason Ritter and Kate Micucci as a couple who have a strained relationship with their two young sons, will air a single episode next week before being pulled. The following week, the network will repeat the season finale, while The Cleveland Show will move into Ben and Kate's 7 p.m. time slot. (There are six episodes left of the series.)

Ben and Kate's troubles come on the heels of Fox bowing last month to reality-dating competition The Bachelorette, which helped its overall ratings and boosted Tuesday's 8 p.m. lineup.

Despite that bump, Ben and Kate didn't stick. And in that case, the fault was more than just its leads. While Kate's brash personality and Jason's comedic chops have had many an audience laughing, the show's plot has lacked consistency since the premiere, when the couple were first married.

About one third of the country had seen flood water in at least 20 per cent of their homes, including Somerset, Hampshire, West Wales, the Midlands and Yorkshire. The flooding has already affected nearly 500,000 people and left around 40,000 without power. The number of people evacuated had fallen to around 15,000 on Tuesday morning, as communities slowly returned to their homes. The floods have caused the worst damage to Britain's homes and businesses since the devastating 1987 storm. But the damage, which began to become visible on Monday, was nothing like that caused by that storm. '

The Environment Agency has called on people to refrain from abusing its staff after police urged people caught up in the flooding not to confront them after they refused to leave their posts.

  The auction house estimates that it will have paid at least $8.5 million in commissions to art dealers, auction house staff, lawyers, and insurance, as a result of the deal.
The buyer has not been named.

  This deal is an example of how the art market is a big business.  The $8.5 million was split among many parties besides the winner.  This money did not benefit the winner financially.  The money went to the auction house, the winner's gallery, the insurance company, the lawyers for the auction house, etc.

  The winning bid may be a good deal for the buyer, but not a good deal for the artist.  The image is not the primary commodity, but the publicity for the artwork is -- as are the auction fees and commissions for everyone involved.

  Artists have been dying for years.  But we still have new artists.
The economy is improving, so there are more buyers for art.  And people are going to buy art either way.  The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  It's just that"

72354,4,"SUE TILLEY DIES: LONDON ART WORLD REACTS
LONDON, April 16 (Reuters) - The family of Sue Tilley, the London woman dubbed ""Big Sue,"" said she died after battling breast cancer on Thursday aged 69.
Tilley was a familiar sight in London and its surrounding areas: a blonde, large-framed woman, her hair in a bun but with hair spilling down over her shoulders.  A London regular, it was estimated that she had appeared on as many as 25,000 posters.
Her image graced every London tube station for months with posters describing ""The Benefits Supervisor Resting"" and ""The Benefit Supervisor Sleeping"".
Her images were the subject of a series of exhibitions at the Saatchi Gallery and the V&A, plus one at the Hayward Gallery in London.
Her body of work was bought by London Mayor Boris Johnson for the city, which had become a world leader in art, literature and fashion, Tilley and her benefits-related work became as much a part of the London identity as the Eiffel Tower or the London Underground.
Many celebrities had appeared on her large posters, including the late Princess of Wales, the Rolling Stones and Andy Warhol.

It also seems weird that there was seemingly no discussion between Lib Dems and Tories or even Cornish themselves, before the announcement.

A quick search on Wikipedia showed me that there are about 200,000 Cornish living in England, and yet the number of MPs is more than that in the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly, etc. The Cornish are also the 6th largest ethnic group in England according to the 2001 census.
Of interest I noticed that both of Cornwall's three MPs, plus all 10 in the House of Lords, are hereditary peers. Cornish MPs seem to be more numerous than members in the Commons. At present, only three members of the Cabinet, including the Speaker, are drawn from the Cornish community (though the Tories could be losing more on the way).

59167,4,"Cornwall is a Cornwall, but it is also a part of England. In September 2008 `David Laws, Liberal Democrat and Cabinet Office Minister, announced that Cornwall would be an officially `recognised' minority group, with Cornish people now gaining the same rights and protection as others in the national minority community in England, Scotland and Wales. At a time when public policy is taking in the voices of the disabled, the sick, the unemployed and other under-represented groups, Cornwall is an important development. It marks the inclusion of a community which has been often ignored and left behind. However the granting does not mean that Cornwall will be recognised as an official `country'. But then perhaps David Laws and Lib Dems had already decided on the subject of Scotland, and if so a question then needs to be asked about the nature of the relationship between Cornwall and the rest of England. It is possible to be a minority group and yet be part of the country within which you live. For example, Cornwall is a `race' not a `people', and the majority of Cornwall is England. The Cornish don't have an identity that is a separate and distinct part of England.''''"

I wonder what they could have done to avoid this. If the movie's not funny, it isn't funny. I'm not a movie reviewer or anything, but I've been enjoying movies much less, thanks to the current trend to dumb down everything into a watered-down, watered-down comedy.

While such a move will boost Hearts' capacity by less than 2,000 seats, the hope is that the improvements in technology which have allowed the stadium to hold over 30,000 in recent decades will prove useful in ensuring a first-class experience for all supporters.
The structure would consist of a single grandstand, with an open concourse area below it. The club also aim to create a new covered terrace on the West side of the ground, with views of the pitch from below.
Hearts also expect the structure to be open for the start of the next season. Construction would be carried out using a single building company, and would use a 'zero budget' design process which seeks to create structures which minimise their initial cost. The club are planning to publish these designs within the next day, and have asked that supporters submit their opinions on them in advance.

The team say the new structure will be built in a publicly-listed area of Princes Park, by the south-east corner of Tynecastle Park, where the stadium pitches are. It is intended that the new stand, expected to cost 60 million pounds (approximately 78 million dollars) will open for the 2017-18 season. The Edinburgh club say their new investment will mark a move away from relying on money from fans. Owners Ann Budge and Chris Dobey said they wanted to address the club's ""image and financial sustainability"" and said it hoped the structure would be open in time for the following season. They added: ""This is an ambitious project which is crucial to ensuring we continue as a leading club from this city. ""
The project is part funded by a ""record cash boost"" from the club's owners, who say the money will be paid back over 20 years, without borrowing or debt.

A right hand flattened his opponent at 1:39 of the first round, putting him on the ground as the crowd rose to its feet. A left to the body dropped him moments later, leading to his second career loss at 55-6-2. Tyson, 41, recently announced his retirement.

The Russians should be aware that their action in Ukraine is being viewed with suspicion and is raising fears of further destabilization of Europe. The recent actions of the Russian leaders clearly show that they are pursuing a policy of Russian chauvinism and disregard for the norms of international conduct.

64156,1,"` A new alien species of snake is making its home in North America. The northern African python was originally found throughout the sub-Saharan Africa. In 2012, Florida was overrun with around 2,000 of these snake snakes, and over 100 of them had been relocated back into the wild from the Everglades. Scientists are concerned the snake could eventually reach the Mississippi River. The reptile, measuring up to 20 feet, has an appetite for almost anything it can get its jaws around, including alligators and crocodiles. In order to get rid of this threat, the snake would need to be killed or trapped. But Florida wildlife officials say these snakes are difficult to catch, and the process of killing the snakes could also be destructive to the ecosystem. Although it has a taste for man-made food, the native Florida panther and the exotic Burmese python are the main sources of danger to humans.

The Sulphur Controversy

(By Hugo Gye)
On the side of a volcano in the eastern edge of Java island is a series of villages known as Banyuwangi. Banyuwangi is one of the fastest-growing towns in Indonesia and is fast becoming a center for the mining of sulphur, a substance critical to manufacturing chemical fertilisers and pigments.

In Banyuwangi, the town's main attraction for foreign tourists is its sulphur volcano; it is one of the few volcanoes in the world with an active sulphur pool and the only natural sulphur mine in Java. Its sulphur is produced from a process involving natural heat that comes from the boiling-hot underground springs that flow nearby the volcano's summit. The sulphur is then carried through a number of underground channels to the surface where it is harvested and sold.

Around 10,000 to 50,000 miners descend every day to mine sulphur for the city, which is located at a height of 1800 meters. Most of the workers are Balinese, but locals from across West Java also come to work in order to make a quick profit. The risk is enormous, and in the"

Finally sulphur started to cost very expensive. We decided to quit this dangerous work and go up to the crater on this mountain which is active to get sulphur. Ijen was the place which was used to mine sulphur. We had to climb the side of the crater using a metal ladder which was very risky and time consuming so I decided to document it.''

Amin, a local entrepreneur who also photographs the miners and other activities in the area, told the Mail Online:``After the miners reached that height they have to climb up and down with a heavy load of sulphur stones in their hands to be able to sell it to local industries that use it in production. It was very dangerous, the miners were afraid at all times there could be an earthquake that could have brought down the volcano. At the side of the crater, they worked and we went up to the top of it. I had a small video camera.'

47196,3,"Sulphur is one of the most toxic and corrosive substances on earth. It is normally isolated from atmosphere by rainwater, snow, or sea spray, making it useful as a fertilizer used to grow crops. The most common use of sulfur is in fertilizer, used by the majority of the world. However, since sulfur is not readily biodegradable, it becomes more and more difficult to find and use over time. The amount of sulfur being produced now can only sustain this population for a limited time. With the demand for raw materials in industrial countries rising every year, the amount of sulfur needed has to be mined, and the process of mining it is very dangerous. In Indonesia where it is almost everywhere and used in industrial processes.

The Ijen volcano complex is about 200 kilometres (124 mi) from Banyuwangi, the largest city on the island of Java. Banyuwangi is not a major industrial city, so most of the sulfur in the area is used by local residents in their homes. Most of the sulfur deposits in the area have already been extracted, which means that the miners must work in dangerous conditions. One of the most dangerous activities is sulphur mining which involves miners climbing the side of a dormant volcano"
47196,4,"Sulphur-based industrial compounds, such as sulphuric acid, are a very common ingredient in the products we use every day. It's a chemical compound comprising sulfur, oxygen, and hydrogen. The sulfur portion, also known as the sulfur atoms, are in a liquid state because of high temperatures it would have to reach, but the oxygen does not move. This leads the sulfur atoms to be at a much higher potential energy than the oxygen, meaning it is a highly reactive chemical. This makes it so difficult for the oxygen to bond with a hydrogen atom. Thus, the hydrogen atoms can only bond with a sulfur atom. The hydrogen atoms can then react with a molecule of hydrogen, or a combination of both, but very little other than the sulfur atom. This is because of the high potential energy of the sulfur atoms. It must have a strong bond before the oxygen can be able to do anything with it. ```
These gases are formed through natural geological processes, and are common on the surface of many active volcanoes. Minerals like zinc ore contain sulfur, which the volcano exude. Mining sulfur on the side of a volcano is a hazardous and dirty job, but the work pay well. The sulphur is used in a number of common industrial"

More than the latest in a series of allegations surrounding Chelsea this season, Jose Mourinho’s pre-match pressers have become an annual occurrence in recent months. The most recent incident came Friday, when Mourinho pulled out of a meeting with reporters because he was unhappy about not getting an explanation for the second yellow card of his managerial career. And there’s now even been an admission from the coach.
The official match report from Chelsea's 1-0 win over Newcastle last Sunday mentions ""Mourinho had left the building prior to the start of the press conference and was no longer in the auditorium."" The team manager was not there by the start of the meeting with the media, according to the report.
This was hardly a secret. Mourinho is known to get into his press conferences late, even running out of the meeting at some points -- as he did with a few outlets last season.
The Guardian reported that he did just that this weekend, telling the press that he had ""a little problem with my heart"" that was ""preventing me from giving a press conference now.""
That explanation, as laid out on the Guardian, was, well, more or less that. But it did come after hours of reports,"

“The key, and most telling, is the evidence in the disciplinary process. It shows a pattern of misconduct and, crucially the FA failed to take action against several clubs last season. Manchester United was fined, the FA has accepted, for a lack of proper record keeping, but Chelsea was ignored despite having a huge number of incidents.
“The pattern was clear. Chelsea had issues in the first six months or so. The club took action. As the problems continued the FA took no action. Chelsea made their complaints. The FA did not respond to them. Then the pattern broke down because the issue was “Chelsea not a repeat offender.” The FA found no offence.

Holland proved more than capable, occasionally steering towards controversy with some strident views on ‘the campaign’, the mood around the Chelsea camp and the delicate issue of Frank Lampard.

The informant has no idea of names or addresses and was kept out of court.
The police decided to use the informant to find out about the activities of 17 defendants.
Two of the parties were raided after information supplied to the informant by the informant.
The parties led to 17 people charged in connection with the abuse.
Newcastle Crown Court heard that people at the parties bought alcohol and drugs.
Victims were passed around and forced to have sex.
Mr Gamble was asked about the process in place for checking the credibility of a witness like this.
""We were constantly questioning the veracity of the information,"" he said.

I've been called this before in the past from random people and people I know, but it has never bothered me in the least. I've had conversations like this before, and while it's hard to see on the outside, I don't let it bother me all that much. At the end of the day, I'm not really sure why people care so much what another person does in private. But then again, that's just me...

This could be a sign of ""Trump derangement syndrome."" These people may be so afraid of the man that they can't resist yelling out things that would be considered threatening under any other circumstances. I saw similar behavior back during the early days of the campaign when a woman (not Muslim) was screaming for security to remove a Trump supporter in her section simply because he was wearing a Trump T-shirt. I'm sure in the same way this woman was screaming at a man wearing a Trump shirt, he would have just as easily screamed and screamed at her. Some people just can't handle it when they meet other people who share their views. I've seen it in spades"

If convicted, he faces up to four years in prison. The charges are among the hate crimes that have reportedly increased after Mr Trump’s victory in the presidential election.

Preston North End are aiming to get back to winning ways at Deepdale following a poor run of form. They are currently 10th in the Championship table, four points above the relegation zone, and have lost four of their last six games.

Their last game was a 1-0 defeat away at Barnsley, which leaves them on the cusp of a play-off spot - an achievement they will not have achieved since the early 1980s.

Nottingham Forest, on the other hand, occupy a midtable position, and are on a run which sees them lose just once in seven games.

The Football Association has upheld a charge against Blackburn Rovers under the Football
Discipline Regulations and fined the club £10,000.

The FA found that Blackburn had violated Rule E10 in its game against Millwall on 9
February 2003 by failing to control their players during the game, which ended 5-2
to Millwall. The charge was upheld based on four offences, as follows:

  1. Refusing to play the game in accordance with the laws and regulations of
the game (""Match Referee"");
  2. Conducting themselves in an unsporting manner, contrary to the spirit of the game
(""The Match"");
  3. Refusing to leave the field of play in the manner required when the Referee stopped play
(""Field of play""); and
  4. Engaging in acts of damage to the property of Millwall (""Property"").

The first three offences took place in the 90th minute. Blackburn, however, appealed
against the incident involving Property for which no sanction was imposed.

New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio won't be returning home until after 5pm from Wednesday's event honoring those that perished on Flight 587. That is because he will be conducting a post-meeting meeting with officials about the City of New York. And it is clear that the Mayor will be tardy in getting back to his home in Brooklyn from it. This isn't the first time that De Blasio has been late to an event. In January, he left a meeting with Mayor Michael Bloomberg 20 minutes late and blamed the weather.

To top things off, De Blasio was also going to attend Monday's meeting of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. However when that meeting was slated to start at 4:30 p.m., De Blasio was forced to cancel his attendance. He cited 'other business' as the reason for his absence.

Article: Tory transport spokesman Russell George accused the Welsh Government of ""hypocrisy"", given its view that Severn Bridge tolls should be abolished.
Referring to the Cleddau Bridge tolls at 75p for cars and £1.50 for lorries, he said: ""They've done nothing to tackle the one toll it could scrap.""
The Welsh Government said it was a local authority matter.
Pembrokeshire council decided in May to keep the tolls in place after a review.
The criticism comes after the UK government announced plans to cut the Severn Bridge tolls by more than half.
Cars, vans and small buses could pay as little as £3 from 2018, after the crossings return to public ownership.
Wales' Economy Secretary Ken Skates said the tolls should be scrapped, as a tax on entering Wales.
Mr George criticised the minister, claiming he failed to answer his point about the Cleddau Bridge when he raised the issue of tolls in the Senedd.
""It's a bit rich of the Welsh Labour government to grumble about the Severn Bridge tolls when they've done nothing"

1. To deal with the ongoing migration crisis;
2. To strengthen the Union’s solidarity and cooperation on external relations, and on protecting the Union's external borders;
3. To better protect the values, including the rule of law, inherent in the concept of freedom of movement of persons;
4. To better control the external borders;
5. To accelerate the full implementation of the reform of the asylum system.
6. To step up efforts to combat cross-border crime and improve the control of external borders;
7. To strengthen the cooperation on countering illegal migration;
8. To develop a long-term strategy on migration to complement the efforts that already need to be made;
9. To work out an operational procedure for the European Border and Coast Guard, including on capacity and financing;
10. To adopt relevant recommendations and guidelines.

The site is being run by Tony Benn's friend and adviser, David Miller, while Lord Adonis and Lord Mandelson are advisors. The New Labour Project website also says that if Ed Miliband wins the General Election, `he must make clear that he won't go with the tide of Tory cuts'. This is the party line as advocated by David Cameron and George Osborne for two years, and Miliband has already told the electorate he plans to stand with the tide. David Cameron said David Miliband has `had his chance to stand up for the interests of ordinary people in British politics.

 Environmental Group: `Bluefin' sushi to eclipse $1m mark

Tuna auction draws record bid

The BBC's Robin Brant in Tokyo

This year's auction of some $3.18m worth of the high-quality Pacific bluefin tuna, which is popular in sushi, helped drive the price of fish to a new record high.
Last year it set the previous record price of $1.9bn and was expected to fall short by around half.
But the fish, caught off the northern Japanese coast earlier this month, sold for a huge $1.823m.
That's just over $4,500 per kilogram.

It is believed to have been caught by a Japanese-run group in a large operation off the coast of northern Japan.

The highest bid last year of $1.974m for a catch from the same fish was made by Kiyoshi Kimura, a sushi chain owner.
This year he had already spent more than $600,000 on three different tuna, paying out $3.4m for the highest quality tuna and $3.6m for the lowest-cost fish in early December.

Why it was a record price and then why it was not : why only 7.6 million yen per kg and was not 56.7 or even 55 million per kg?

Why no mention of the quality of the fish?

He said: ""This is the world's biggest Celtic coin hoard ever, this was a significant part of a tribe's wealth.
""It is also one of the world's biggest coin hoards and certainly the biggest coin hoard found in Britain.""
Work to separate and uncover the secrets of the hoard has been delayed while Mr Mahrer works on other projects and details are agreed over long term conservation plans.
A large mound containing about 70,000 coins was discovered last year by two metal detector enthusiasts.
Reg Mead and Richard Miles began their hunt after a woman told them her father had found coins in a field some years before.
After the initial work looking at the surface of the mound taken from the ground in Jersey, Mr Mahrer started the process of replicating the object.
He said: "" You mix silicon rubbers up, pour them on to the hoard and it will set on there. It then records in fine details so you can use copies for microscopic work.

The 50-year-old is widely regarded as highly-qualified and has been promoted during a spell that saw his former assistant Lee Johnson appointed as head coach at Barnsley.

He is the fourth person to take up the position of youth academy manager following the departure of Elliott on Wednesday.

Johnson was keen for Wright to rejoin his staff when he took charge just two days after his final game in charge at Oldham.

But the head coach was in no doubt that Wright needed further qualifications if he was to be able to take the Barnsley post.

“I had a really good chat with my manager, Lee, and it was a no brainer in terms of his thoughts and feelings about where I would like to be in my managerial career,” Wright said in an interview with the Barnsley website.

Bignone, who ruled Argentina from June 1982 until the nation's return to democracy in December 1983, was found guilty this week of kidnapping and torturing 22 people. The punishment stems from an investigation into a secret detention center hidden inside a hospital during the country's military dictatorship. Under his command, at least 22 people were kidnapped and taken to the center, known as the ""Chalet at the Posadas Hospital,"" according to evidence in the case. Five of those were tortured during their detention, according to Argentina's judicial information center. Bignone, was previously sentenced in April 2010 to 25 years in prison for kidnapping and torturing 56 people. Up to 30,000 students, labor leaders, intellectuals and leftists who ran afoul of the dictatorship because of their political views disappeared or were held in secret jails and torture centers during the nation's eight-year ""dirty war."".

France has the talent and I am confident that they are going to win this match. The French will use their home crowd advantage effectively and this is going to benefit them. The French play the game of footy with a great tempo and are not going to get bogged down by any team. The French are the form team in this competition, in fact they are the only teams that seem to be playing well on the day. There may be two or three teams that are in better form than Australia, Wales and Ireland but at the moment not enough to separate those teams. Scotland are the only other team that is competing like France. It goes back and fourth from week to week and it will be the same this week. France will be focused on finishing in the top four and will get the job done. Both teams will be able to produce a quality"

Derbyshire play their home matches at the County Ground, Derby, and have done so for over 300 years. Their ground was known by various names during that time, being first named the Derby and then Derby Park. From 1839 until 1890 it hosted only first-class cricket on a regular basis. From 1906 to 1969 it held weekly Saturday league matches. The ground hosted Test cricket for the first time in 1882, against England. The ground also hosted, or will host international and first class international matches that will fall outside the Test series and include four of the five Test-playing countries.

The first first-class match that Derbyshire played on the present site was in 1680, two years after Derby Castle was built. The club first entered the County Championship in 1864. Derbyshire reached the championship final in 1985 for the first time. This was only one year after they had become a first-class county, but they lost in the final at Lord's to Somerset, who had been relegated. This was the first of"

In my humble, somewhat less than 100 years' experience as an ex-firefighter I can tell you nothing unusual about an early morning fire.
These events are all very much the norm.
However, where the fire was caused is where the mystery begins.
Fire tends to be caused by a variety of means.
Lighted candles, short circuits in electrical wiring, cooking items placed too close to heat sources, careless disposal of smoking materials, a careless smoker, etc.
Lighted candles are usually the cause of fires in residential properties. This was apparently the case here (see above).
It is almost certain that the fire started with a lit candle.
It is unlikely that the Regent Complex had a working fire detection system in place at the time of the fire.
It has been alleged that a faulty electrical box was the cause of the fire and this is likely to be the case.
However, there are other possible causes of the fire, none of which are yet clear.

At 7.00 a.m. on the morning of June 14th, 100 years ago, the British battle fleet assembled before the light of day off the north coast of Denmark.
A decade and a half of warfare, an incredible 20,000 Allied lives and a terrible toll of British warships had been lost.
And yet it was still possible, it was still possible to fight at sea.
At 7.00 Sunday morning on Wednesday, Britain, led by its new admiral Alan Jellicoe, would return for the last time to face Germany’s main fleet, the Kriegsmarine, in a day of battle.
The British fleet would have fewer ships than the Germans, fewer guns, fewer torpedoes, fewer submarines, but it was much better trained and had more planes. The odds were very much against it.
But Jellicoe knew the Germans were unprepared for what a sea battle would bring after so many years of bombing raids from the air.
They were still using torpedo bombers, planes too fragile and poorly armed to survive a long"

Forty fighting ships including battleships, cruisers and destroyers sailed into the lough.
They were guarded on either side of its mouth by specially built forts with long-range guns, including Fort Dunree on the Inishowen peninsula.
The fleet commander, Admiral Jellicoe, saw the base as one that was safe from U-Boat attack.
But, in the years to come, the German attack would take its toll in the cold waters off Donegal, sinking HMS Audacious and the SS Laurentic.
Eventually, Jellicoe knew he would have to return to the North Sea to face the Kaiser's fleet - an appointment met on 31 May 1916 off Denmark, in what became known as the Battle of Jutland.

50002,1,"The main argument for the position of the self-employed, as opposed to employees, is that they are not at the mercy of the company or their employment status - they control the money they earn.
They pay for their own home or cars and also a larger amount of their lifestyle.
The argument as it affects employees is that they have to pay for a car and a home, and most will also want holidays and pension contributions included and other employment benefits such as sick pay, paid leave etc.
The self-employed will not tend accept any form of pension and pay all National Insurance. They do not want health and holiday cover. They prefer a high standard of work, so they are prepared to work for companies that may not pay above the minimum wage.
This might cause the number of self-employed workers to rise significantly, although, as the article discusses, they would be less likely to pay contributions to the State Pension.
So the Government wants to make a greater move to increase employment numbers, and wants to make it a bit harder for people to be self-employed.
I think it fair to say that self-employed workers will be the ones hardest hit by the tax rises. Although they pay more National Insurance contributions and may get less tax"

Uber and Deliveroo - the Treasury is on your case.

Philip Hammond regularly cites evidence that the growth of self-employment is undermining the tax base - by between £3.5bn and £5bn a year by 2020 potentially.

The self-employed tend to be lower paid and also still pay, even with the tax increases, a lower level of national insurance compared to the 12% paid by full-time employees.

Those who are self-employed point out that they are in a much more precarious employment and have often decided to take a risk as entrepreneurs.

And they do not receive pension contributions and entitlements such as holiday pay, which are rights for those directly employed by companies.

Oddly, the government decided to raise taxes on the self-employed first, rather than tackle the advantages gained by companies that use self-employed workers.

Those firms often pay lower levels of national insurance and do not pay"

65855,1,"UK government wants to keep us
in Europe and won't allow parliament a say in
`in-out' referendum

By Tony LloydBBC News Online, London

At the start of the debate on the EU referendum bill, Michael Meacher MP (Labour) asked if the PM agreed that the current voting age of 18 should be kept. The PM replied:

""Personally I agree with Mr Meacher that the current age of 18 should be maintained until the EU referendum that will take place in six years' time"".

Ministers are refusing to put the ""in-out"" referendum on the ballot paper but say the question should be put to the public. They say under the Representation of the People Act 1983, ministers would need legislation to restrict the right to vote on the referendum to under-18s - which is effectively a form of electoral fraud.

But the SNP and Labour have been pressing the government to allow the vote to be held using a ""simplified"" form of proportional representation similar to that in the Scottish referendum. Mr Cameron told MPs MPs were expected to vote to lower the voting age from 18 to 16 for the Scottish referendum in August last year. But it is widely expected to be blocked by the government"

Mr Cameron said MPs should decide on votes at 16 during scrutiny of the European Union Referendum Bill, which has begun its passage into law.

Responding to Labour's acting leader Harriet Harman, Mr Cameron said: ""I believe we should stick with the current franchise of 18, but I think the House of Commons should vote"".
BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the vote could be close, with Labour and the SNP lining up alongside any Conservative rebels on the issue.
Mr Cameron also defended his plans to change the rules so the usual pre-election 'purdah' period will not apply ahead of the referendum.
Purdah brings restrictions on government spending and announcements, and critics say it is needed to prevent an unfair advantage for the government side at the referendum.

  France hardest hit
  One person was killed in a building collapse in Paris, while a woman was killed in a fire in the southern city of Lyon, police said.
  Others were killed in a landslide in the Pyrenees in the southwestern part of the country, falling trees in the Paris area, a car accident and a car fire.

For the first time since 2010, meteorologists predict two snow storms barreling through the country in the next seven days will engulf Florida - a usually snow-less state.

Tropical storms are not something which anyone goes looking to. So when Orissa was hit by an unprecedented and deadly tropical cyclone only two days before the start of the annual festival of Diwali, there was no time to get ready.

Residents of Koraput, one of the worst-hit districts, said the authorities were clearly overwhelmed by the sheer extent of the damage. But after a night of horror the worst is perhaps behind them.

Thousands of local people have given up their own homes to help the thousands of people who have been made homeless. They are now living in schools, government buildings and temporary shelters.

As the number of deaths is expected to rise above the 18 which have now been confirmed, it's likely the state government is going to fall even further behind on an already difficult rebuilding process.

The Indian Navy has already flown in engineers and equipment and is prepared to give the state any help it needs.

In the meantime it's a difficult time for the many people across the country who have friends and relatives in Orissa, but no access to the internet or their mobile phones.

52197,0,The Welsh government has launched a review of the Welsh carrier's air service.
52197,1,"The new £2.5 million air link connecting north Wales and Cardiff has been operating for just a year. But even before it began services were under question - its safety record was revoked in October 2015 and the company operating it, Clwyd Air, went into administration just two months later.
The Air Wales Link connects Bangor, Caernarfon, Wrexham and Pontypridd and uses an Airbus A320, which offers more leg room than the A319 which has operated the Cardiff to north Wales link previously.
The cost of the service is £2.5 million and the Welsh Government has awarded the contract to Clwyd Air.
When it was first announced it was expected to bring in an extra 1.4 million passengers per year to the north of Wales but it has been hit by bad weather, a strike by air traffic controllers and air traffic control cuts at Cardiff airport.
As of the end of July, just 9,300 passengers have used the service this year, which is short of the target of 11,000 passengers a year for 2017/18 by Wales AM Rhun ap Iorwerth, who raised the concerns about the performance of Clwyd Air.

Service not cost-effective

A controversial rail service has been in operation in north Wales for nearly two years.
It connects Deeside to Swansea, the UK's fourth largest city, but links in the other direction are rare. There have been claims it helps Swansea to ""import"" jobs from Deeside, and that Deeside businesses are reluctant to invest there because they are so cut off.
However, it is due for review after an official has described it as ""not cost-effective"".
The service was launched in 2007 and has received about Â£1m of public money annually.
It was found to be underperforming in a 2014 report and operator LinksAir had its safety licence revoked last year.
Figures obtained by the party have suggested the number of passengers on the service have fallen in recent months.
Some 8,937 passengers used it from September 2015 to August 2016, compared to 11,111 in September 2014 to August 2015, according to information provided by Economy Minister Ken Skates to Tory AM Darren Millar.

Comment: Tom Bennett is a fine individual, I have no doubt that he will be up to the challenge, despite past history, in improving the situation in UK Schools. He has a good track record of making real improvements to learning in London.
In fact Mr Bennett seems like one of the most level headed individuals in education, having dealt with a number of the more extreme cases of the 'extreme educational issues'.
I am sure that anyone could have made the same points that he made when taking on this job, it seems as though most people who deal with the situation see it as yet another opportunity for personal aggrandizement.
On the plus side Mr Bennett has a very high reputation within the education community, so it is very positive to see him doing this role.

59539,2,"Tom Bennett says he is going to tackle behaviour that threatens to ruin our children's education''`

The Department of Education is to set up a new body responsible for monitoring behaviour both in schools and across the whole educational system.
The new body will be led by the former headteacher Tom Bennett, and will represent people from ""the very beginning of a child's life - right through to adulthood and beyond"".
The announcement comes as the government looks to tackle so-called disruptive behaviour in schools.
Recent inspections by regulators have highlighted issues with disruption in both primary and secondary school environments.
According to the Office of Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted), low-level repetitive persistent disruptive behaviour could be costing pupils their education and future employment - up to 20% of the time.
Inspectors said some schools had problems with it, ""but the same schools in every area are affected by a persistent, regular pattern of disruptive behaviour"", which should be the exception, not the rule.
""The scale of the problem is greater than teachers may have realised"", Ofsted said.
The Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) launched a consultation on how the behaviour of pupils at schools can be improved in the Autumn."

48150,2,"UEFA are to launch a study of ways in which clubs in Europe could be encouraged to spend more to help combat the financial inequality between the world`s wealthiest teams and the rest. The Financial Fair Play rules were introduced after the 2010–11 season to limit the amount of money generated by teams. Those that make a profit are allowed a net investment of €10 million (£7.9 million) in the current season and €20 million next, with both figures reduced by 10% each year. There is a total spending allowance of €45 million (£35 million) over the period. But UEFA are understood to be worried that there is an unfair advantage to clubs who have wealthy owners. The BBC Sport analysis of income for the past 13 seasons, from June 2006 season, to May 2016 shows that the 19 clubs who had the highest spending were all in Europe`s elite leagues: Juventus, AC Milan, Porto, Manchester City, Monaco, Inter, Chelsea, Roma, Napoli, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich, Paris St-Germain and Real Madrid. The clubs also generated the biggest revenue.

  Who are the African Diaspora? **  In general, migrants from the African continent have left to seek better economic opportunities (educational, economic, professional, social) or to pursue self-improvement. The average African migrant will leave home without his or her family; that is, it is an unaccompanied youth without family support. More recently, women have joined the ranks of ""diasporan"" Africans.

  What are the causes of emigration? ** Economic Development: It is well understood that for a country to grow there must be a demand for the goods and services that its economy produces and that must meet the needs of the citizens. In Africa, this need for growth comes from the development challenges associated with high unemployment, a huge population of youths, and widespread poverty. For a long time, the global economy has driven economic growth in the African continent, and this trend is unlikely to change anytime soon. The growth of globalization, combined with the rising need for the commodities African countries produce, offers a chance to increase income and improve the standard of living, but with the cost of mobility to and within Africa.

Police said she bought a product containing oil derived from cannabis plants which can be inhaled through a vaporiser.
Officers said she may have had a ""severe reaction"" to the product but cannot confirm a direct link.
Insp Mark Duncton of Gloucestershire Constabulary said: ""Our advice is never to buy or take any kind of drug or drug derivative bought online.

New technology developed by archaeologists and engineers from Vanderbilt University, in the US, should accelerate this process.
The device will be tested later this month at the Mawchu Llacta site.
By including cameras, Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies and programming specific flight algorithms to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) developed by Aurora Flight Sciences, Professors Julie Adams and Steven Wernke hope to three-dimensionally map the archaeological site.
""To say anything about past societiesâ€”past social dynamicsâ€”we need to be able to place the material traces of past peoples in their fullest context possible. Mapping is therefore at the core of archaeological research,"" Prof Wernke told BBC News.
Mapping areas is often labour intensive and the site where the system will be tested would usually take about six months over several years to document.
The new UAV should enable the team to map the area in minutes, once the system is perfected.
The site will be a test of the UAV's flight capabilities.

82041,4,"Most sites are mapped but only once and never again in a different context. This is extremely time consuming and tedious.
As mentioned, the system they are developing will be able to map a site multiple times, with different types of sensors attached.
This makes the system much more efficient and allows multiple archaeologists to work through the site.
This is especially important for large sites, such as the Andean Highlands, where a team of archaeologists may not all go to each part of the site.
The system will also help keep data more secure than it is currently.
With only one location being mapped, data could easily be lost or tampered with.

It depends how many more people become carers as a result of the proposed changes. It might make little difference in the short term but it could potentially reduce people's need to work if/when they reach old age (if carers have more time left during retirement with less need for care and more money to spend). Or it could potentially reduce the average level of support, resulting in carers having to provide more care on top of their job (if demand is so high), leading to them having lower pay and more stress.
This isn't simply a case of the care system being underfunded or under-delivery - the question is what is the best solution?
I'm not defending the current system, but the government have been very opaque about what changes they'd like to make and how they want to fund them.

The current system was also built under conditions (and with an intent for outcomes) that didn't really exist.

The Age UK analysis built on work from the London School of Economics in April, adding in loss of wages to previously calculated loss from tax revenues and claimed carers' allowance.
Loss of earnings was estimated using three surveys: the carers survey - to examine the proportion of male to female, part-time to full-time carers, the labour-force survey - to calculate average earnings, and the population estimate.
On Tuesday the Local Government Association warned the rising cost of adult social care could ""soak up"" almost all of council spending by 2020.
Currently, £14.6bn is spent on adult social care services in England.
Last year the economist Andrew Dilnot was asked to look at the problem and suggested: ""It is possible that the total budget for [social care] could reach nearly all council spending by 2020.""

The article does not describe why she returned but the headline indicates it is more than just the absence of her ticket: ``Woman who slipped past airport security is nabbed at LAX.'' The title and subtitle imply that the judge did not want to prosecute and that Ms. Hartman was allowed to leave.

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A judge sentenced a woman to 177 days in jail Wednesday after she flew from San Jose to Los Angeles without a ticket, saying she was trying to avoid an earlier domestic violence conviction. Judge Allan Rubin said he hoped Marilyn Jean Hartman would serve her term in Santa Barbara County so that she would have a safer place to live than in Los Angeles. Hartman, 62, had been released from Santa Clara County Jail on June 5, and went to LAX instead of attending her scheduled probation meeting, the Santa Clara County Public Defender Office said. Hartman has a history of mental illness and has said that she feels safer in airports than on the streets, assistant public defender Gary Beadie said.

On July 22, 2002, Marilyn Jean Hartman, 62, a San Jose woman with a history of mental illness, was sentenced to 177 days in jail after admitting that she violated her probation by attempting to sneak back into the Los Angeles International Airport.

During a hearing at Los Angeles Superior Court, Deputy Dist. Atty. Frank Mateljan asked the judge to impose a prison term with additional jail time after Hartman admitted violating her conditions of probation by trying to cross the airport boundaries at Terminal 2.

Hartman, who was sentenced on July 22 for sneaking into a flight while on probation for trespassing, made a plea agreement to serve 177 days in county jail for violating probation.

(Reuters)

Dundee United kept their top-flight status on Sunday while relegating Celtic's next opponents to the Championship as Aberdeen's hopes of taking second spot faded with a 4-0 loss at Hamilton Accies.

Scottish champion Celtic have played 32 games and lost just twice all season but their hopes of making history and going the entire campaign undefeated appear to have been ended by Dundee United's 1-0 win over St Mirren on Saturday.

Celtic could have gone top with a win on Sunday and a victory in next Tuesday's first leg of their last-16 tie against Manchester City in the Champions League would have had the Hoops champions before the final day of the season at home to Motherwell.

Dundee United coach Jackie McNamara had admitted before the trip to St Mirren that his team had little chance of beating the Buddies ""because they do not lose in the leagues"".

But his team responded superbly with a performance and result of a team who have never been relegated and avoided the drop in three of the four seasons they have been in the Premiership.

A story that will help explain the story is:

As the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street movements spread across the globe late last year, it wasn't immediately obvious to many that a parallel movement was happening in the Middle East.

In many of the Arab world's many countries, the Occupy movements were swiftly condemned as a kind of vulgar Western assault on national cultures. The protests, and the Western commentators who supported them, were accused of being ""dangerous"" and ""sarcastic,"" and had a ""trivial"" or ""misguided"" effect on the actual struggles for democracy across the region. Some commentators have compared them to the rise of neo-fascism, or worse.

And yet the Arabic Occupy protests have been different for two reasons. One: They were more spontaneous and organic than the Western ones, and were not led by established political parties or media outlets. Two: They took off on social media -- Facebook in particular, through a wide network of young bloggers called ""lone wolves.""

In fact, during this period of mass protests and revolutions taking place in countries ranging from Tunisia to Syria and Yemen, the role of social media and the Internet in mobilizing"

''A Glamorgan signing of rare quality'

The deal will keep the South African in Wales until 2019, but he will not play four-day cricket for the Welsh county after this summer.
""I am delighted to commit to Glamorgan,"" said Ingram. ""I've been made very welcome and have made a lot of friends so it was an easy decision"".
Ingram is in Glamorgan's 14-man squad for their One-Day Cup match with Somerset on Friday.
Ingram enjoyed a successful first season with the Welsh county, scoring 1712 runs in all formats, including two championship centuries and three in List A cricket.
A knee injury prevented Ingram from playing long-form cricket during 2016, but he scored 502 runs and record-equalling 29 sixes in the NatWest T20 Blast, helping Glamorgan secure a home quarter-final.
""It is a big coup for Glamorgan to sign Colin for another two years,"" said Glamorgan chief executive Hugh Morris.

The gunman was accompanied by a suicide bomber, who blew himself up in the car park.
No-one so far has said they were behind the attack but the Islamist militant group Boko Haram has carried out similar raids in the town.
The name Boko Haram, loosely translated from the region's Hausa language, means ""Western education is forbidden"".
The gunfire at the College of Administrative and Business Studies sparked panic, with students jumping from windows to escape the militants.
They were injured after jumping out of windows and over walls, the Associated Press news agency quotes a hospital worker as saying.
The police have said that the surviving gunman is in their custody.
The attack in Potiskum comes as Boko Haram is facing renewed pressure, reports the BBC's Abdullahi Kaura Abubakar from the capital, Abuja.

There was an explosion and a car was set on fire at the college on Sunday, eyewitnesses told the Associated Press news agency.
""The explosion was caused by a suicide bomber,"" police said a statement.
They said the attack was coordinated and that ""security has been beefed up in the area"".
President Goodluck Jonathan condemned the attack. He called on all Nigerians to support the security services and ""the good people of Potiskum"" in the fight against terror.

Boko Haram attacks

There has been a spate of attacks in Potiskum in the past month, as the school reopens after its Christmas break.
The most recent of these was an attack on a government office building in the town.
Four people were killed as the militants hit the building with gunfire and grenades, AP reports.
Many of the town's residents are originally from Benue state and neighbouring Nasarawa, where the militant group has been active for years.

On 27 December, suspected Boko Haram militants bombed the Nigerian Army Intelligence School in the town, killing at least 20 people.

Who?

This attack was carried out by members of the Ansaru splinter group of Boko Haram.
Ansaru was considered the second most violent terrorist wing of the group, after the main Boko Haram group.
Ansaru operates by posing as police or tax collectors and attacking targets which it does not agree with (usually police facilities).

What?

This attack involved a car bomb.

Two men exited the car and started firing on innocent students and security officials, killing one of the gunmen.

The surviving gunman then drove away.
However this car was stopped by security forces.
It was revealed that the remaining gunman was accompanied by a suicide bomber and the suicide bomber detonated his car causing the gunman to commit suicide.

Flt Lt Sean Cunningham died in a tragic accident at Lincolnshire airfield on 8 November 2011 when an ejection seat malfunctioned and fired the parachute strap on board his Hawk aircraft.
The aircraft was at Lincoln Airfield where RAF personnel were taking part in the RAF Air Policing mission when the accident occurred.
The cause of death was recorded as brain injuries as a result of neck compression at the time of impact.
A number of factors contributed to the accident but the most significant was the seat firing handle being in the unsafe position.  The ejection seat was working when it was tested in the UK, however an internal safety pin could be inserted when the seat was in its inoperative position. This is not a safe design as it is the seat’s safety mechanism that is activated and not the ejection mechanism. Furthermore the seat is not able to be easily inspected by aircrew at an appropriate point in the flight.
The ejection seat was a Martin-Baker Mk.10 (MB10) ejection seat for the Eurofighter Typhoon and is manufactured in the UK by Martin-Baker.

Jurors who convicted former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his former political chief, Ratko Mladic, last year of genocide say the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is biased against Bosniaks, Bosnian Serbs claim.
In a statement Saturday, the Bosnian Croat representative to the Nuremberg trials, Dario Kolar, said the majority Serb verdict showed ""a clear prejudice of the Bosniaks against the Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims.""
The trial chamber found Karadzic and Mladic guilty of the July 1995 genocide in Srebrenica - the crime where 8,000 Muslim-Croat men and boys were killed in Europe's worst single atrocity since World War II. Mladic is sentenced to life in prison, while Karadzic was sentenced to 40 years in prison.
On Tuesday, presiding judge Theodor Meron upheld Bosnian appeals for a retrial on two of six alleged war crimes for which Karadzic and Mladic had been convicted. The"

As was the case last year, Haradinaj's co-defendant, Sami Allagui, was found guilty of murder and sentenced to the maximum 30 years in prison under international humanitarian law, which can be extended if the convicted person is found to be guilty of other war crimes.

The case of former Bosnian Serb wartime military leader Ratko Mladic, before the ICTY, is the only current case where a single Bosnian Serb commander is accused of atrocities during the Bosnian War and all are held to be legally responsible of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

The indictment against Mladic was issued in May, 1995, and was issued by the so-called Bosnian court which was being used to try war crimes committed by war criminals on both sides of the conflict.

He had described some of the tribunal's judges as ""imposters""; they had not followed, let alone understood, the UN Security Council resolutions that had given the tribunal its mandate.
He had accused the court's prosecutors of having ""failed to deliver evidence"" against the defendants and the presiding judges as ""not fully objective"".
It had been a case, he argued, where the ""process, rather than the person, was the subject"".
After hearing two months of evidence against Momcilo Perisic, the former Bosnian Serb military chief, the tribunal's appeal chamber had taken this case and the others like it to the limit.
Yet the result had begun to seem beyond doubt as judge Meron analysed the failings of his colleagues in The Hague tribunal's trial chamber.

  BERLIN -- French police arrested a man Wednesday they believed was behind the killing of two French journalists at a newspaper here and had threatened to retaliate.
  The suspect was a former employee of the daily newspaper Liberation, the Paris prosecutor said, and, for nearly a year, the gunman had been seeking revenge on the editor, who had fired him, the prosecutor said.

  There appeared to be no previous connection between the gunman and the newspaper itself, other than that, like the editor, he had worked for several years at another newspaper that had not employed him.

The report states:
""A serious lack of leadership and management, and poor professional governance, has left the mental health system in a perilous state. For too long, and perhaps because of the lack of leadership and management, care and compassion has been lacking for some patients.

Summary :

The report’s analysis suggests that the scale of the
malfunctioning of mental health services is “of unprecedented gravity”.
It adds that mental health care has in too many cases suffered
from “inadequate and even dangerous quality in the past” and the problem
is the main factor behind people having difficulties in their life.
The Government has accepted that the system is broken and must be
moved away from an “all-too-easy” focus on treatment and rehabilitation
to the kind of prevention and early intervention of the kind practised
successfully in countries such as Nordic countries where there is a “clear
and agreed national strategy”.
However, the report’s chief author Dame Pauline Green says the taskforces research suggested that the problems with mental health service will take many years to fix. She said the taskforce was focused on setting out a plan which would enable the NHS to deliver significant improvements in the quality of care and the prevention of disease.

93325,2,"In the report on the state of mental health services, the author claims it has an effect on a patient's overall health and well-being.  The author of the report, Peter Gray, a former clinical director at the Centre for Effective Mental Health, suggests that more effort should be put in the NHS to treat psychological disorders.

A new report published by Professor Peter Gray, clinical director of the Centre for Effective Mental Health (CEMH), argues the NHS needs to give a significant amount of resources towards psychological care as the overall healthcare system is under pressure.

Professor Gray wrote a report for the Coalition in 2011 on the way forward for mental health services, and while the report acknowledged the need for more investment, it fell short of providing sufficient long-term funding.

Despite having acknowledged this, the report outlines that the NHS is still struggling to cope with the demands, especially when it comes to caring for children and teenagers. He writes, “We have a real challenge in that our NHS services have been under-resourced for the better part of a decade.”

He continues, “This creates an enormous burden on the NHS. It is difficult to quantify the consequences of this for individuals, families and the cost"

Mr Rossli, from Kuala Lumpur, was cycling over a flyover in Barking, East London, when he was attacked as a group of people ran up to him. They grabbed his shirt and a scuffle erupted before he was knocked to the ground. His victim is seen dazed and bleeding heavily clutching his jaw.

Oxfordshire social services are alleged to be in contempt of court once again because they have failed to remove a 17-year old girl from her family. An order prevents the council from removing the girl from her home or attending any of her activities, yet the council has failed to apply for the removal order and as such the local press can freely describe the girl's whereabouts whenever they wish to.

The Council did not appear in order to argue a breach of the order, and Judge Simon Oliver gave the Council an opportunity to do so. This means that the case, which until now was a closed matter, could now be a public one. This case would be a major blow to local authorities that believe the best interests of children can be overridden by their own ideology.

Instead they have allowed the press to publish as they wish, even with the girl’s name and address in plain text.

Liz Hurley and Shane Warne spent Valentine's Day together just days before 'amicable end' to relationship
by David James
22 February 2014
Former couple Liz Hurley and Shane Warne spent Valentine's Day together. The pair have reportedly called time on their seven-year relationship and are now said to be ‘amicably ending’ to go their separate ways.

The couple were last seen at Hurley’s home in London on Valentine’s Day on Tuesday and the model later headed to Las Vegas for work.
The exes spent the day together in Los Angeles in late January before enjoying Valentine’s Day together in Hurley’s west London home.
Sources say the pair have decided to cut ties after spending more than seven years together.
A source told the Daily Star Sunday: ""Liz and Shane parted last month and it has been an amicable end to their relationship.
""The split seems to have been amicable because they spent Valentine's Day together. Liz has stayed in the UK while Shane travelled to Vegas for work.""
The two met in 2006 after"

HNIC is the official Canadian television program of Hockey Night in Canada. Hosted by Scott Oake, HNIC is broadcast in all nine of Canada’s provinces and territories each year, reaching more than 4.5 million Canadians on television and radio.

The program is produced at HNIC's base of operations in the province of Quebec.

Scott Oake is the play-by-play announcer for the program and hosts segments before and after the games - the 'Hockey Beat', a panel of hockey experts who cover both current and historical hockey topics, as well as the 'Daily Faceoff', a roundtable segment with the opposing coaches. Oake also interviews players.

HNIC is typically broadcast from CBC Television’s studios in the Radio-Canada Centre, at the heart of downtown Montreal, for most games. The building’s rooftop is seen as one of the best places in the city to witness the beautiful Montreal skyline, which extends almost to the horizon.

He has not seen enough of Drogba in training to know what kind of effect he will have on the Chelsea team. To say of Drogba that he is still a nightmare in training is a bizarre comment which I believe is a reaction to Mourinho's desire to reduce the influence exerted by the team's most influential player. Terry does not know what kind of effect Drogba will have upon the team and does not know what the team dynamic will be. It remains to be seen whether they complement each other or not. Drogba was on the bench for the start of the season. He and the team need a bit of time to gel. Drogba is back training with the team after his post-season holiday in Turkey, so it will not be long before we get to see him in action.

But the judges refused to give the green light for the challenge, saying the judicial review was ""premature"".
The Supreme Court ruled last month that Parliament must have its say before the government can trigger Article 50 and begin official talks on leaving the EU.
Parliament is in the process of considering legislation which would give Theresa May the authority to notify the EU of the UK's intention to leave by the end of March.
MPs overwhelmingly backed the bill on second reading on Wednesday.
The latest legal challenge was brought by supporters of a so-called ""soft Brexit"" - which would see the UK remain a member of the EU's internal market.
They include Peter Wilding, chairman of the pro-Europe pressure group British Influence, and lobbyist Adrian Yalland.
The government claimed the case was unarguable since the existing EEA agreement would automatically cease to exist once the UK left the EU.

Article 12 of the draft Brexit deal with the EU sets out transitional provisions that expire at the end of 2020. It allows EU citizens coming to the UK during that period to settle permanently.
The UK is due to be out of the European Union by the start of 2019, but this period is intended to allow both sides time to agree the terms of a permanent deal.
The wording of the proposed agreement on citizens' rights is controversial, in particular because EU citizens will be allowed to stay in the UK before the final deal is decided.
They will be able to do so on the same basis as those who arrived before the original transition period.
Those who have completed the process will have settled status and will be covered by a ""backstop"" arrangement.
Those who have arrived since the UK joined the EEA in April 1995 must register in order to maintain their status.
If they are unable to do that, which may happen if the UK imposes unreasonable requirements, they will cease to have settled status and be given a period of three years to move to another EU country.
There is also a separate arrangement for Irish citizens.

The United Kingdom officially launched Brexit talks today, after MPs approved the EU withdrawal bill by an overwhelming majority.
Prime Minister Theresa May had wanted to kick off the process on Tuesday, but was forced to delay until Thursday after MPs failed to agree the publication of the legislation on time.
The Queen approved the bill last month, but had to ask MPs to get the legislation through another two stages in the Lords to bring it up to speed.
Some had criticised Mrs May for seeking the approval without making more of the concessions she made to get it through.
But in the last 10 days, the government has been accused by Tory rebels of ""lurching from one u-turn to another"" by changing the bill at the last minute, making concessions to defeat them and being accused of trying to avoid a showdown over the bill in Parliament.

A tractor-trailer clipped one bus carrying students back from a college visit and then struck another head-on, leaving three dead, Mississippi authorities said Tuesday.

``I've been doing this for 41 years and this is the worst wreck with this number of people I've seen,'' said Calhoun County Sheriff Billy Gore. ``It's troubling to see so many young kids so so frightened.''

The accident happened on state routes 8 and 9, which are combined for several miles. Footage provided by CNN affiliate WMC in Memphis, Tennessee, showed the damaged bus on a narrow bridge.

The truck continued a few hundred yards before coming to a stop.

Calhoun City is in north central Mississippi. The investigation is continuing.

A New York University graduate student sued four prominent researchers, claiming that they secretly videotaped him while he did research at the university's prestigious Tisch Brain Tumor Center. On Monday the federal judge in the case dismissed Drs. Kenneth and Charles Heilman from the suit -- Dr. Kenneth was named executive director of the Tisch Center in March -- saying there is no evidence that ""the recordings occurred in a manner intended to harass"" the plaintiff, Dr. Kenneth Deffner. Instead, Dr. Deffner claimed a voyeurism and invasion of privacy case, saying that he is seeking damages on behalf of himself and others who have been photographed.

Article: Art critic Richard Billingham examines the legacy of the late 18th century English textile and textile design genius William Morris (1768-1840) who is celebrated in a new exhibition, 'Anarchy and Beauty : William Morris', at the National Portrait Gallery. Billingham notes the striking similarities between the life of Morris and that of Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778), the pioneering French Enlightenment philosopher and writer. Rousseau's life included a brief marriage with a young aristocratic mistress, but he would, as Billingham puts it 'never be the most popular figure on the art scene'. Morris, too, lived in a house, he had a wife and children, but, as Billingham notes, many of Morris' fellow aesthetes disapproved of him for his radical politics. It"

<DIV>William Morris (1834-1896) is one of this century's most influential and well known artists. Born in Wales and trained at the Royal Academy under Sir John Landseer and Sir Joshua Reynolds, Morris is a master of Victorian landscape. One of the most influential artists of the late 19th century, he is remembered as creator of a distinct style of the ""Art Nouveau"" movement (an 1868 exhibition at the Crystal Palace was called ""An Ideal of Beauty in Art""). He was also a co-founder of the Arts and Crafts movement, the founding figurehead of the League of Novice Craftsmen, and a co-founder, along with J.S. Woodman, of the Victorian Society, which is the source"
17048,3,"The British National Portrait Gallery today opens William Morris: Anarchy & Beauty, a major exhibition that is the first and only overview of a celebrated British creative visionary and social reformer. An intellectual and aesthetic precursor to the modernist movement, Morris (1834-1894) was also the preeminent designer and craftsman who created beautiful homes, furniture and decorative objects for ordinary people. The exhibition's title comes from the socialist poet John Maynard Keynes' description of Morris as a ""pre-raphaelite painter"" and ""not entirely an anarchist."" The exhibition, which runs until March 28, 2013, features some fifty portraits of Morris and his close collaborators and friends on loan from national and private collections, including: William Morris' House, a striking wooden-and-cobalt structure on the grounds of the University of Reading; The House of Seven Gables of William Morris, a magnificent English Gothic-style home on the island of Capri in the Mediterranean; and William Morris' School of Art, an educational institution that he founded in London, as well as furniture and decorative objects created by him.

The former Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Police has been cleared of gross misconduct after an independent disciplinary panel upheld his claim that his reputation had been damaged by a public inquiry into complaints about his conduct.

A panel found Gerry Gargan, 48, guilty of eight counts of misconduct last month, after he sent messages with personal information to other police officers and put images of a woman's body and underwear onto a personal account.

But Mr Gargan had always denied wrongdoing over six other allegations of sending inappropriate messages.

On Wednesday, he was told to quit by the force's police and crime commissioner (PCC) Sue Mountstevens.

Ms Mountstevens said he had ""abused his position"" by forwarding emails and ""storing intimate images"" on his work phone and revealed she had started the process of using new powers to call on him to quit.

The ballot results were disclosed in a letter Ms Mountstevens, the contents of which she revealed on Thursday.

We cannot let the Police Federation push for Gargan's suspension, but their actions are understandable given the circumstances.
I have just completed a similar task in removing one of my senior officers from a post.  I could not agree more that Gargan should be given a reasonable warning. If the Police Federation were not so concerned with protecting their members at all times, they would ask the Justice Minister to consider this matter carefully rather than jumping on something out of the blue.

The company was founded in 2013 by an MIT grad named Dr. Daniel Reber, who started working on technology that he used to turn people with severe facial deformities into life-sized, realistic images. The technology involved using advanced facial-recognition algorithms, which can analyze and enhance a person’s facial features to give them the same sort of lifelike quality that one sees on a CG Hollywood animation. The FaceGen technology, first released last year, works in much the same way. Using a combination of algorithms and a large set of reference facial scans, FaceGen can create a high-resolution, 3D model of a person’s face. That model can then be modified and updated with up to three thousand facial expressions. It can also add the person’s voice in with"
30609,4,"********************* By The Washington Post | By Peter Nicholas Washington Post Washington’s newest and last chance to get it right at the World Anti-Doping Agency will come this week when the federal agency that sets standards for the world’s sports grapples with thorny questions about the science and business of doping. A five-day meeting at the State Department, which starts Wednesday, will provide the American agency, known as USADA, its public platform to make its case before world and Olympic sports authorities about how doping should be tackled in 2015 and beyond. The forum comes amid a growing scandal involving Russia, after President Vladimir Putin confirmed last month his government’s involvement in a state-sponsored effort to manipulate the results of the 2012 and 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2010 and 2014 soccer World Cups by providing its athletes with performance-enhancing drugs and allowing them to inject themselves with banned substances out of competition. WADA’s executive committee must decide next Wednesday on how to respond to the disclosures. The body’s president is Richard Pound, a former Canadian Olympic champion.

19670,4,"This laptop started an apartment fire in Oregon on Wednesday after its battery ignited nearby bedding and clothing. The house fire in Corvallis began around 10.30am in a shared student apartment in the city, according to the Corvallis Gazette Times. Firefighters believe the battery of a 2008 MacBook Pro started the blaze after the battery fell out onto the floor of the ground-floor flat on Southwest 49th Street.

The laptop battery's terminal shorted and caused the bedding and the clothes to catch fire. The incident has prompted the local fire chief to warn against leaving laptops near combustible surfaces when not in use and get batteries which overheat or don't hold a charge checked out immediately.

Thankfully a fire alarm at the home triggered a fire and police arrived quickly. The owner of the laptop had left the computer so it was partially hanging over a wooden nightstand. It is believed the battery fell from there to the floor.

The battery overheated and burned, and some of its chemical contents probably were released into the room's air.

The database used to check identity is not one to match suspects' photos against. It does not contain every picture of every suspect, or even those wanted for a crime. It contains only those of people the police have arrested or convicted, then photographed. By doing that, police not only keep a record of the number of people held in custody but also provide them with a means of checking whether the name and identity on their arrest warrant matches that of a living creature on Earth. The database then contains only one of each type of person whose name matches theirs and one of each type of suspect. This provides an important measure of the police's effectiveness: to take their data-entry technology to an even more sophisticated level, the database should contain every single person whose name and identity matches with any of those in the database.

Proteas have a chance to win series in 1st test

24 May, 04:44 a.m.

Hampshire, May 24 (IANS): England's James Anderson took five for 68 as Hampshire were bowled out for 253 before lunch on the third day of the opening Test against South Africa at the Ageas Bowl here on Saturday.

England, set a daunting 628 to win, declared on 217 for seven at lunch.

Paceman Anderson continued his great start to the series by taking five for 68, to be the leading wicket-taker on the third day with seven.

His third five-wicket haul of the summer moved the 32-year-old to 482, just five wickets away from breaking his country's all-time bowling record.

Anderson's fourth victim was opener Kyle Abbott, caught at first slip by Ian Bell off a leading edge in his eighth over on just 12.

That wicket was followed by that of skipper James Vince, who fell for 39, caught at short cover by Kevin Pietersen.

Hampshire's most dangerous batsman, England's Ben Stokes, fell for just seven to Anderson for the"

Sir Peter de la Mare, the Speaker or ""Prolocutor"" of the Good Parliament in April 1376 opened the first day with a long address on the shortcomings of the Crown - military failures, financial and moral corruption. Royal favourites were imprisoned. King Edward III's mistress, Alice Perrers, was condemned to ""seclusion"".
But by the autumn, royalty had fought back. The Parliament was dissolved and most of its work was undone. The King's mistress was back at Court.
The King's son, John of Gaunt, had Sir Peter de la Mare thrown in jail.
And the new Speaker was John of Gaunt's own steward, the far more biddable Sir Thomas Huntingford.
Until the 17th Century, the Speaker's loyalty was to the Crown rather than to MPs. But they were often blamed if they delivered news the monarch didn't like.

The Parliamentary system is based on the concept of the two Houses: the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The House of Commons is the elected public chamber and the House of Lords is the elected public chamber of debate and legislation, where Senators (upper chamber) are appointed by the Crown.
The Parliament of the United Kingdom is the national legislature that enacts the United Kingdom's laws and passes the United Kingdom's administrative and executive functions.
Parliament can be described as a bicameral legislature, as Parliament consists of two national public chambers, Parliament of England and Parliament of Wales. In England and Northern Ireland, the Parliament is the House of Commons, in Scotland the Parliament is the House of Commons and in Wales the National Assembly for Wales.  The Welsh Parliament has the role of law-making, except for constitutional matters which they delegate to the National Assembly for Wales.

  Legislation process

Parliament is the legislative representative of the people, which means it must pass laws that represent the wishes of the people. The law must be produced in statute to be enacted or ""made"" legally enforceable. To ensure Parliament has legal effect its statutes must be drafted, debated, and passed by each sitting of Parliament."

Wales and the continued expansion of our school system is
becoming unsustainable”, according to the Welsh Conservatives’
spending review submission.

They added that the “vast majority” of children are being
exposed to inappropriate Pupil Premium funding allocations by the Welsh
Executive, and questioned what guarantee the executive can provide
that these will not increase in the future.

They said £2million had been allocated to a children’s centre in
south eastern Wales, “when there is already a children’s centre in
every county in Wales”.

WALES' education minister Huw Lewis has rejected Chancellor George Osborne's plan to turn all state schools into academies.
Mr Osborne today outlined new proposals to create a single English school system based on the academy model.
It is hoped the plan means that state schools – which vary wildly in size and teaching – will have the same governance, leadership and facilities and be forced to adopt the same core curriculum.
Mr Lewis said in a statement on Welsh Government website: ""The Welsh Government has no plans to introduce the chaos and waste of academies and free schools here.""
A total of 30 per cent of Welsh schools are academies, with a further 60 per cent local authority maintained, while the remaining 30 per cent are private and voluntary.
Last year, Welsh Government ministers were able to spend two thirds of the funding allocated to schools, compared with just 33 per cent in England.
Ministers also set teaching targets and could change school hours, including introducing longer school days.
Welsh ministers also have special responsibility for funding and overseeing schools in Wales, whereas in England they are funded centrally and overseen by local authorities.
Mr Lewis continued: ""Since 2008, the number of pupils taught in Welsh-medium education has doubled"

18513,4,"THE SCHOOLS BILL
Wales education minister Huw Lewis warned education in his country would suffer unless the government's education proposals were implemented.
He said it would mean more money for schools in Scotland, which had the best performing school system in the UK.
""There is very little evidence to suggest that they have had a positive impact in driving up standards,"" he claimed Wales.
""In England today academies are funded from central government and head teachers have more freedom over admissions and to change the way the school works. It is a significant development in the continued divergence of schools systems on either side of Offa's Dyke.""
The legislation for the schools bill is due to be introduced at the end of this month.
In 2000, the government created secondary schools academies which were not managed by a 'trust'.
These were the first in the UK in part because they wanted to reduce school spending by running schools to an external standard.
They could be closed at short notice and the new trusts could not intervene in them. But under the new plans, the schools bill, secondary schools will have to be academies as a way of providing 'free schools'.
Primary schools would not have to change but could apply to become academy trusts."

Groves, who was floored in the eighth round against Froch in May, is hoping to lay the demons to rest when he fights Frenchman Christopher Rebrasse on September 20.

The bout will serve as a final WBC title eliminator but it has added importance for Groves, who is looking for rejuvenation after his loss to Froch in front of 80,000 fans at Wembley Stadium.

Groves watched the fight back three times that same night and trainer Paddy Fitzpatrick made his pupil go through it all again the following morning.

''I went over the next morning and we watched the fight again and then I took a gamble and rewound it - we watched it nine times and George looked at me as if to say, 'all right. 'I brought up as many emotions as I could so he could deal with them earlier. 'I didn't just watch it nine times with my arms round him - we looked at it and asked why it happened,''
''I wanted him to feel the emotion early and deal with it, like when you get a brown envelope through the door"

Injuries meant their first clash had to be postponed and that made it more frustrating for Froch, who did not want to risk the injury again. 'It was frustrating that I couldn't really get my head around what happened and what I needed to do,' Froch added. 'I needed to think about what mistakes I had made in the past and where it had gone wrong. 'I wanted a proper run-in to really think about where I needed to go and what I needed to put in.

The question has become more pertinent since the advent of devolution in 1997, when separate administrations were set up for Scotland and Wales.  Parliament: MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could be barred from voting on England-only legislation. Since then a large number of policy issues, particularly relating to public services, have been devolved to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly. English MPs sitting at Westminster have no say over the policies set outside of English borders. However, English policies on issues like education and healthcare are still decided by the UK Parliament, and are voted on by MPs who make up the chamber meaning they can come from all the countries of the Union.

64656,1,"The main arguments given for contracting out work from the Federal Government are, first, cost efficiencies, and second, it allows Federal agencies to do more diverse or special duties. However there are three major problems with this logic: 1. Cost: The real savings are the administrative savings, not the labor saving. Federal workers are generally more competent than contractors, but they come with greater pay and better benefits. Government employees are not slaves and can move on if they wish. If an agency pays its lowest valued employees higher than the cost of the lowest valued contractors, it can save money. 2. Service: The services that are contracted out are almost always ones that have traditionally been handled by the Federal Government. It is almost never the case that the Federal Government does not know about some obscure need that a private business can solve. Even the most specialized Federal agencies and programs, that may be hard to handle by private industry as generalists, can sometimes be dealt by specialized professionals within the agency. The most egregious examples are the military's nuclear weapons program and high-altitude weather satellite program. Both have been managed by private companies, and both have had terrible results. Contractors are good at doing what they're contracte  with to do. They are generally poorly or non-"

The civilian work force of Homeland Security numbers 188,000, according to an estimate provided to the senators by Homeland Security. In a letter sent Tuesday to the agency's Secretary Janet Napolitano, Lieberman and Collins said the figure ``raises the question of whether DHS itself is in charge of its programs and policies, or whether it inappropriately has ceded core decisions to contractors.'' Although Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, and Collins of Maine noted that contractors can offer a variety of needed assets and skills to federal agencies, they called the current balance between federal employees and contractors at Homeland Security ``unacceptable, untenable and unsustainable,'' according to the letter.

64656,4,"The Homeland Security Department (DHS) is more contractors than any other federal department and they're doing things like guarding illegal immigrants, searching luggage, and processing passports. Senator Joe Lieberman and Representative Susan Collins of Maine are right to question this fact. This is a classic example of poor management and an incentive problem. Contractor's salaries are high and, hence, they are more valuable when working for the federal government than for the contractor. So, why compete for jobs that have high salaries and little risk? It's like paying more to work a job where you're already a good hire. The sad bottom line is that the federal government can't expect private companies to lower their costs unless the government first lowers its costs. If the Senate wants to restore fiscal responsibility, it should end this practice and, instead, encourage a culture of long-term care. It should also eliminate the ""No Child Left Behind Law"". It's a ridiculous law that makes testing in the schools mandatory, regardless of how well the schools are doing. In Texas for example, students have to take the standardized test every year. The idea is to raise the bar of passing the test for each grade. That's good if your bar for success is raising the number of test scores being reported, but for schools"

Asian stocks rise after Fed minutes.
Asian stocks mostly rose Wednesday after minutes of the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting showed officials have started discussing plans to slow the program that has driven down longer-term interest rates.
The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 Index has fallen for two consecutive days on concerns the Fed may start raising interest rates again as soon as this week.
The minutes showed Fed officials may start to discuss reducing their extraordinary support for the U.S. economy, including the tapering of asset buying, before it hikes rates or reduces the program.

North Korea threatens US naval drill

By Jung H. Pak * Associated Press

DANDONG, China — North and South Korea on Sunday threatened each other with “powerful” strikes, each accusing the other of provocative steps including an attack against a South Korean warship and test-firing an anti-aircraft weapon, and a senior U.S. general held open the possibility of U.S. combat troops in the Korean peninsula’s volatile east.

North Korea on Saturday heightened its threats against the military exercises after talks over the sinking of the Cheonan that could derail the biggest annual U.S.-South Korea military exercise.

In a sign of rising tensions, North Korea said one of its air force pilots was killed in the shooting down of the South Korean jet Friday and the government said it may release a video recording of the confrontation, which is widely expected to include North Korean claims that the fighter violated its airspace. The Cheonan, whose sinking has enraged citizens of both Koreas, was struck by a North Korean torpedo"

In an emotional interview on BBC Radio 2, veteran DJ Brian Matthew revealed that he has been forced to quit his on-air duties with Sounds of the 60s following a long battle with chronic illness.

The 74-year-old admitted that after many years of refusing to contemplate retirement, his health, which has deteriorated over the past 18 months, had finally caught up with him.

Matthew has presented the weekend programme for over 26 years - for most of which he had no medical cover for his illness and was instead paying out of his own pocket for private treatment.

Last year he was forced to reduce his workload considerably after being diagnosed with a serious health issue, which required regular check-ups with a specialist.

Matthew was on-air for 26 years, having started his career as a trainee on Radio Luxembourg in 1973.
It is not clear who will take over on Saturday but Sir Tim Rice, who has stood in for Mattu this week, is a former producer of the program.
Matthew's departure comes as a shock to his many fans, although he had already been under pressure some months ago to give up his weekend schedule.
His health was said to have been fragile and he had made plans to step down from Sounds Of The 60s. He was said to have been very ill but, until last year, was able to host the Saturday show.
""We would like to offer our very sincere thanks for Brian's contribution to Sounds Of The 60s, and to wish him well for the future,"" said the executive controller of Radio 2, Mark Linsey, said.

Matthew's replacement has not been officially announced, although Sir Tim Rice has been standing in for him.

The results show that those living with diabetes are three times more likely to have one of these conditions. People suffering from high blood pressure also had an increased risk of mentally Illness.

New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said Wednesday afternoon that ""an autopsy completed today conclusively determined that Mrs. Joan Rivers did die of natural causes.

The circumstances surrounding Mrs. Rivers' death are now being actively investigated by the Manhattan District Attorney's office, and the medical report by the Mount Sinai Hospital's medical examiner has been forwarded to the office to determine whether criminal indictments will be filed.""

The Story: The Super Bowl Is A Super Trip For Father-Son Duo Who Never Stopped Fighting For Release
By Michael E. Ruane

A Missouri teenager and his father can’t wait to go to the Super Bowl. That is especially true for Ryan Ferguson, who spent 10 years behind bars and still can’t imagine how an innocent person could spend so long in prison. For his father, Bill, it is an opportunity to thank his son for never giving up on fighting for his freedom.

“It’s always been Ryan’s dream to go to the Super Bowl,” Bill Ferguson said of his son. “So when he first was released in 2013, that whole year he was planning for the opportunity to go to the Super Bowl.”

The father and son will head to Glendale"

When Ryan Ferguson and his dad travel this week to Glendale, Arizona, for the Super Bowl, it will be a bucket-list experience. And yet for them it will be so much more. For Ferguson, a Missouri native, it'll be a chance to thank his father, Bill -- the man who never stopped fighting for him while he spent 10 years behind bars for a crime he didn't commit. ``Being able to do this with my father after all he's done for me, sacrificing 10 years of his life to prove my innocence -- that's when it became real,'' said Ferguson. The father-son pilgrimage came about last month when a ticket distributor who had heard about his story offered Ferguson an all-expenses-paid trip to Sunday's game. The 30-year-old, who now lives in Florida, was released from prison in 2013. Ferguson's 12-year nightmare began on November 1, 2001. He and his friend Charles Erickson, both then 17, were drinking illegally at a college bar in Columbia, Missouri. Around five blocks away, Columbia Tribune Sports Editor Kent Heitholt turned off his computer after a long night and left the newsroom shortly"

The jury at Bradford Crown Court today heard the 26-year-old had been driven to a remote area where she lived in a dingy studio flat with walls covered in graffiti. A McDonald's worker had been keeping her there on threat of a gang of fellow gangsters threatening to cut her head off when she left. Abdul Hanif, 30, of Bradford, also planned to force her victim into prostitution to help repay his gambling debts. Jurors heard he took away her credit cards and mobile phone, effectively making her a prisoner, while forcing her to have sex with him every day.  The victim said he wanted to use her as a prostitute to pay off his gambling debts, and when she refused he tore a phone charger from the wall and strangled her, leaving marks on her throat.  Jurors were told Hanif forced the victim cook his meals, adding: 'He would fly into a rage if he was unhappy with what she was serving.'

Talks on end to Colombia's decades-old conflict start

56999,2,"Peace negotiators trying to end Colombia's blood-drenched, five-decade old civil war Sunday announced an agreement on land reform between the Colombian government and FARC rebels. The land reform agreement is the first of six points that negotiators need to broker to reach a peace deal. ""It's a historic change, a rebirth of the Colombian countryside which could lead to an end to the conflict,"" said the government's lead negotiator, Humberto de la Calle. Under the agreement, land not being used would be turned over to poor Colombians to cultivate. The government would provide loans and credits to the farmers. Impoverished areas of the countryside would also receive improvements in infrastructure, health care and housing. De la Calle said land that's privately owned would not be affected. ""Urgent changes to the establishment are knocking on the door of the state, demanding citizen participation in political decisions and choices that would guarantee them a future with dignity,"" said FARC lead negotiator Ivan Marquez. Both sides cautioned Sunday that the land agreement would take effect only if an overall peace deal was reached.

Dollars, Not Bullets Could Save Colombia
By JONATHAN W. COOLIDGE
Published: April 11, 2001

COLOMBIA'S government is at a crossroads:  In an election year, it must choose
between its support of Colombia's war on narcotics or accepting more
fiscal responsibilities to confront its high crime rates.  In effect, the
government has made a deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
that would cut off FARC money flows from narcotics and taxes and instead
provide development funds that would end the guerrilla group's arms
transactions.  On some issues, the government and the FARC agree.
``We agree on everything,'' President Alvaro Uribe said last week,
addressing the negotiations held in Havana.  ``We are making very good
progress.''

A police-led sting has seen the capture of an international gang wanted for crimes against the British rail network.
Detectives say that after years of investigation, the group is now being hunted across the UK.
They have been linked to a string of thefts from trains as well as damage carried out to the network's infrastructure.
""This has been a very long-standing and complex investigation,"" said Detective Chief Superintendent Chris Bell, of British Transport Police (BTP).
The raids began in September 2001, when the force launched Operation Quattro, a three-month sting operation in which several people with varying levels of involvement in the offences were identified.
A £100,000 reward was put up.
Six suspects, including a former train driver with links to Irish organised crime, and a woman who acted as a cash courier, were arrested on Tuesday and a court has granted them bail, with no date set for a trial.

Deaths of babies on weekends significantly increase

I have heard that babies born on a sunday do not have the same chance of survival as babies that were delivered on a weekday.

Are you making a case for Saturday deliveries (ie Sunday evening?) or for Sunday (and, perhaps, Monday) births in general?

The answer is both. (In this case, all weekday births, to the extent that they can safely be managed without significant morbidity for women.)
I think that there is at least partial truth to these rumors.
To the extent that they're true, part of the reason may be that hospitals are less likely to schedule doctors for weekend shifts if there are no emergencies (on the theory that those doctors are already committed for the next business day).

The problem with any study is that it does not take into account the impact of poor staff morale on the delivery of care, particularly acute care.
In other words, perhaps the patients in overstuffed wards, the ones that aren’t being given the best care, the ones who aren’t receiving drugs, the ones that aren’t being given the monitoring that their"

It's a major step forward in the county's efforts to promote diversity across all backgrounds. An equally important step was taken in December when the Yorkshire County Cricket Club unanimously reversed its decision to bar Geoffrey Boycott, the former England Test opening batsman, from standing for election, in a vote which brought together members from various parts of the county.

Colin Denton is one of Derbyshire’s most experienced names on radio as he gears up to front a special appeal to raise awareness of early cancer symptoms.

The veteran presenter, of more than 10 years, is appealing for cash for Derbyshire Derbyshire & East Staffordshire Cancer Partnership’s education programme, Skcin. The appeal has been prompted by Colin’s diagnosis with stage four melanoma in 2013.

His openness and optimism as he battles the disease has touched thousands of listeners.

He said the appeal could make a difference in helping fight back against the disease.

The BBC is working with the Derby Telegraph and charity Skcin, which specialises in skin cancer prevention. The appeal has been set up to help educate children in Derbyshire and East Staffordshire about how to stay safe in the sun.

""David Warner was charged with two breaches of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel in an international ODI against India in Melbourne on Sunday. The incident occurred in the 23rd over of India’s innings, when Warner, after the third ball of the over had been bowled, came running in from long-off to collect the ball after the batsmen had run two. He confronted Rohit Sharma and then appeared to say some words which were clearly audible above the sound of the play to at least one teammate in the Indian change room. However, the International Cricket Council found Warner not guilty of a second breach in relation to these words when he claimed that Sharma’s actions were “impossible to see”.

The governing body imposed a suspended charge of “failing to properly appreciate the situation during the event” which, if upheld, would have seen Warner fined half his match fee and also suspended for the next fixture.

This was clearly a very difficult decision for the Lions selection panel, and they picked players from 8 different nations so they have a pretty good case to answer to for the decisions made.
Gatland picked a squad that would win the Lions test series against the All Blacks, he's done his job. The players selected had to give him that certainty, and his selection is hardly 'disgraceful' is it?

To be precise the author was referring to the fact that only nine backs made the squad.

Ah, thanks. For that the writer has indeed misused the word 'disgraceful' :)

Scotland full-back Stuart Hogg will make his first Wales appearance when the two sides meet at Principality Stadium in the autumn.

The Welsh management has made nine changes from their line-up to take on Australia this weekend, taking the total number of changes since Warren Gatland's first game in charge to 15.

Scotland's Stuart Hogg is a late inclusion in the starting team to face Wales in Cardiff on Saturday.

The full-back - one of five changes from last weekend's win against Fiji - replaces Mark Bennett in the starting line-up.

Logan will join Glasgow Warriors this summer and has been touted as a future British and Irish Lions back.

77070,4,"""Pacquiao vs. Mayweather takes place this weekend in Las Vegas. The fight itself is reportedly the richest event in history, with both boxers in line for a reported $100 million each.

What's going on?

The fight has been arranged as part of a $75 pay-per-view broadcast that will be available for $9.95 to online subscribers of HBO, Showtime Sports or other providers. Mayweather will be boxing for the Showtime network.

The fight has also been promoted under the Showtime umbrella, meaning that Showtime is the only pay TV outlet in America, as well as Canada, to broadcast it. The other pay per view outlets, notably HBO and FITE.TV, are also not shown to U.S. residents.

For many U.S. fans, Mayweather vs. Pacquiao is the only way to see the fight.

It has been estimated that more than one in four homes in the U.S. cannot afford Pay Per View. According to Nielsen, 20 percent of those homes with a TV are only available on satellite or digital cable — and of those, 50 percent already have HBO or Showtime. The other 50 percent have a TV only because of their home internet connection."

This week the weather has been like a powder snow maker, when air passes over the snowpack it is cooled and some vaporized into very small particles (snowflakes). Then sunlight heats them. The smaller the particles, the more the sun's energy is absorbed. Eventually ice crystals form -- the largest visible in winter -- and the sun's energy is reflected, instead of absorbed.

This characteristic, too, is known, and it has been used to determine snow's refractive index (1.52), which is about one-half as high as that of water. But what about its optical properties?

December 31, 2013

La Guardia, the third largest airport in the U.S., has fallen on harder times than its namesake.

Over the past decade, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs this airport, has invested fewer dollars in it than it did in any other of its 11 airports. The federal government, meanwhile, has spent $2.2 billion on La Guardia since 2008, most of which went to a series of failed efforts to make the air traffic control system there more modern.

The Obama administration is in the middle of a broad effort to modernize much of the nation's airports. To date, $4 billion of the president's budget for 2013, which is less than this year's investment in La Guardia, has gone to airport improvement programs.

''This is the first time in 20 years that we've gotten significant air traffic facilities funding from Washington,'' said Dan Laustsen, the Port Authority's vice chairman and executive director. ''A lot has changed.''

The Port Authority, which controls the country's largest port complex,"

Stow murder suspect allegedly used knife to kill victim

CLEVELAND - A woman who has been arrested in the brutal slaying of her friend and housemate near Cleveland told police she stabbed the victim multiple times as she lay face down on a bed with her own knife in her hand, but claimed to have no idea where she left the weapon.

Roxanne Buck allegedly told police they would probably find the murder weapon in her car.

Buck, 44, is facing a murder charge in the death of Michelle L. Johnson, 21, whose body was found Friday evening in the trunk of a car parked behind her house on the 6500 block of Westchester Drive in Stow after Johnson's co-workers at the Domino's pizza restaurant where she worked had not heard from her in nearly two weeks.

``

The Photographer says that they were ""extremely lucky"" to witness this hare camouflaging whilst trying to photograph it in its natural environment.

``

They describe the animal as being ""quite difficult to find"" whilst in the snow. The Photographer says that they spent a long time trying to figure out how to approach the animal without startling it.

``

The Photographer spent more than five hours of ""difficult"" and ""confusing"" work observing this animal.

``

The animal was in a difficult position in the snow and it is not known how it found a way to sit up there.

The Photographer says that this was one of the rarest and most impressive hares they have ever photographed.

Mr Howard, 52, of Edinburgh, started photographing wildlife as a child and has followed in the footsteps of his parents, both artists, from home in Scotland and across the world.
An animal lover, he has photographed many mammals, including grey wolves, mountain hares and red foxes, but nothing on this scale, never mind living with it, and he says never has he seen anything quite as majestic as his fellow traveller - the largest hare on record.
''I think the mountain hare is the king of the British hare world, and it's a magnificent animal. The snow changes their colour so they are almost white and blend in perfectly in the snow.'' Mr Howard, 52, has spent the last five days living with the animal to capture his image of a male mountain hare.
His first glimpse of the animal saw him sitting bolt upright in a car, which quickly became a mobile den as he prepared to spend the day with its magnificent presence.
Fully camouflaged
To get the best shots, Mr Howard, who used an old-fashioned camera, left the car and stalked the snow-covered habitat, taking as many pictures as he could."

His mother, Sarah, told the newspaper that her son kept in contact with his friends, played guitar and kept in shape. His father died two years ago.

The Court of First Instance and Appeals have some of the most bizarre rulings of the entire legal system.

It seems that no judge wants to be the one to call it in their system ''Corruption and Deceit''
Here is an example:

Corruption and deception are common occurrences in the UK and across the world, from the world of politics and government to the private sector.  In 2001 the World Economic Forum listed Britain with 47 out of 144 countries as a corrupt country: the first place in Europe after Greece.  British law enforcement has made it its mission to bring down the corruption, and it is working. In 2005, corruption was officially recognised as one of the three major risks for investors to the UK economy.

Despite an increasing success in the corporate world, a survey has found the glass ceiling still looms with nearly a fifth of women (17 per cent) believing it's impossible for a woman to reach senior management. The research also found that more than a third (36 per cent) of women aren't climbing the career ladder because they aren't confident to ask their bosses for more. Over a third of women said their lack of confidence stopped them from asking for a promotion or pay rise. According to the study, which was carried out by O2, this lack of self-esteem is stopping women workers from asking for the promotion or pay rise they feel they deserve.

It's probably the same as the last tour, in that they are going for as many bowlers as possible, although the selection of Rankin and Tremlett at least looks more forward looking than the selection of Prior.

They obviously want to take eight in the end if possible, but they also want to make sure that their pace bowling has some variety to it, both because you can't predict how they may play on particular pitches down under (although obviously they will look for conditions favouring their pace attack) and because you need your seam bowlers to do a role in the limited batting opportunities you will have over the five Tests. So they have decided to take three of those who can bowl accurately and consistently over the old ball and three of the faster, more variable type who can be useful in the tail and make inroads when the wicket has been hard.

In its more than a decade of violence the group has caused
more than 800 deaths, thousands of injuries, and hundreds of thousands
of euros worth of destruction of property.

This is the sixth time that ETA has bombed a building in the same
neighborhood since Spain's Civil Guard killed its leader, Gara Laizaga,
in April of 2004. This is considered the group's most violent
retribution for the killing of its leader.

It has killed hundreds of security forces since then through
suicide operations and ambushes. The Spanish police have intensified
their surveillance of the group in recent months, and have arrested dozens
of ETA suspects after undercover agents posed as terrorists to capture
their communications.

ETA has been weakened by the arrests and the use of police techniques,
but despite these steps, the group remains intact; it is still very active
and the police have been unable to capture its leadership. There are also
indications that the group is becoming more radical, particularly after
being disappointed at the trial of nine ETA members. The court acquitted
the defendants"

The company, Ferrovial Agroman, is involved in building a high-speed train line in the Basque region, which ETA opposes. The attack came just hours after Spain's Supreme Court declined to allow two new leftist Basque parties to compete in the March 1 Basque regional elections in northern Spain. Authorities allege the new parties are simply new names for other leftist Basque parties already outlawed for their links to ETA.

Jim Goodwin led Strathclyde Police for 15 years but, on Saturday, he became the man in charge of the bottom club in Scottish football.
He was the big winner when Ayr United and Queen's Park were drawn out of Conference A at the League Cup draw on Monday - not only for himself but also for Scottish Football League clubs.
Stryker, the official title for the Conference A promotion and relegation play-off final, has been an under-rated one. St Johnstone and Partick Thistle failed to win promotion from Division Two after losing the final in the past two years and even Queen's Park, champions in 1998, came up just once, in 1996/97.
But it has not affected Ayr as they have already booked their place back in the top flight - albeit via the playoffs.

Economist and former Ulster Unionist economy spokesman John McKeown has warned the cost of implementing the proposals could end up being much greater than the £160m figure quoted by the first and deputy first ministers and the DUP's Stephen Farry, the new chief executive of the civil service.

He told BBC Radio Ulster that the report the civil service was expected to produce was unlikely to look at the wider implications of a reform plan on the wider public sector if implemented.

""The only thing we can really conclude so far from the discussions between civil service and political representatives is that there is going to be something like £160m of savings,"" he said.

""But in terms of the implications, we as a political society and as a public sector need to look at how we manage the impact of such a thing.

Leonard Nimoy has died of complications from COPD, his family said. He was 83 and died on Friday at his home in Los Angeles.

He will perhaps be most remembered as Spock, the Vulcan science officer played by the late Nimoy on sci-fi series Star Trek.

He is survived by his wife, Susan Bay Nimoy, who was by his side when he died.

``Indonesia: Obama unlikely to miss speech to top
university.

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The worst may have passed for President Barack Obama's two-day visit to Indonesia, but it remains to be seen whether the ash cloud from an erupting volcano will disrupt his speech before one of the country's largest universities.

White House officials said Thursday that while there is a chance the ash cloud could force officials to shorten the President's trip to the capital city of Jakarta, Obama has no new schedule to announce.

The Mount Merapi volcano spewed ash for a third straight day Thursday, but the winds that carried the fine particles southward were subsiding Thursday afternoon. Flights on the capital's two major airports had resumed late Wednesday following cancellations Tuesday and Wednesday.

U.S. government officials said Thursday that the ash plume was expected to hit Java's south coast or the nearby Moluccas on Friday. They noted, however, that ash clouds are hard to predict.

         The White House is closely watching how long a volcanic ash cloud hanging over Indonesia's capital keeps flights grounded. In a hastily arranged news conference Friday, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters the administration continues to monitor the volcano ash, but a decision on whether the president will leave Sunday, as planned, remains on the table. But, Gibbs said, if the ash cloud lingers, the plan could be altered. The volcano in central Java's Solo has been spewing ash into the sky for three days and a new forecast put the cloud at 7 miles high Friday afternoon. It is still unclear whether it will affect Obama's visit. ""They are working to try to get flights back up and hopefully flights are up and running by"

The government's new funding of £35m will go towards improving maths teaching and making sure that it is understood by pupils from low-income families.
It will be used to establish new maths and computing teacher training programmes for teachers in state-funded secondary schools from September 2012
In the short term, it will support existing teacher training to help schools with specialisms or specific problems with maths teaching

In this year's University Entry Survey (UES), we asked participants what they thought were the advantages and disadvantages of going to university. This article is the first to investigate students' expectations on the two biggest disadvantages of university life- that they pay more than private school students for their uni education, and that they do more groupwork than A-level students, and then compare these to their perceptions of the experience. As a result, students expect their post-1992 university experience to be more like what they experienced at secondary school (including more groupwork and less individual time than in secondary school) and like private school students in how much they paid for their uni education (including more money than private school students). We also compared participants' mental health status and their intended university disclosures of mental health problems, and find that students with a mental illness expect to get worse treatment at university than students without a mental"
30900,4,"After all the effort of getting a university place, the Higher Education Policy Institute study suggests, there can be unrealistic expectations.

Most young people expect to have more teaching hours in university than in school, when the opposite is the case.
The study also found that young people with a mental health problem were unlikely to have told their university.
There have been many surveys of student attitudes - but this is unusual in looking at the expectations of young people about to become students.
The study, carried out by the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) and Unite Students, suggests that as well as being excited and nervous, many students are deeply ill-informed about what to expect.
About half a million new students begin university courses in the UK each year - and an annual Hepi study published earlier this year suggested that only about a third thought they were getting good value for money.
The latest study, based on a sample of more than 2,000 young people, suggests this"

NEW YORK — The stock market climbed on Friday, propelled higher by a better-than-expected report on the U.S. economy that raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates sooner than later.

Investors also bought banks stocks after the latest monthly jobs report showed U.S. employers adding 255,000 jobs in July and revising upward earlier months. The report also showed more consumers are entering the labor force and the unemployment rate is lower than a year ago.

But the job totals are still below the levels of before the 2008 financial crisis in December 2007, and the Fed's goal is to boost employment, not stock values. In a series of press releases shortly after the report was released, the central bank said the jobs market is ""still far from our employment and inflation goals"" and reiterated its promise to be patient with any Fed interest rate increases. The Fed now holds short-term rates at historic lows and has said it will not be raising interest rates until 2015 — at the earliest.

The new laws have left many students questioning the legality of some of their drug and alcohol consumption. ''It's a nightmare,'' said Christopher Whetstone, a senior psychology major at Ohio State.

But what if you could have one or two pieces of cake and then go off and binge-watch Netflix for a while without gaining a pound? A technique called intermittent fasting -- which involves fasting in the early part of the day and eating a high-protein, low-calorie snack -- has shown promise for weight loss. Scientists at Scripps Research Institute in San Diego and Ohio State University have isolated a molecule that's key to this process. In one study, mice fed a high-calorie diet and followed with an intermittent-fasting regimen weighed.7% less than mice fed a high-calorie diet and.8% less when fasting was imposed after the high-calorie diet. Mice who were fed a high-calorie diet plus intermittent fasting ate the same amount per day as non-fasters and lost the same amount of weight. This suggests that people may be able to take advantage of intermittent fasting to kick-start weight loss. A bigger study that followed people for nine months found that the same effect was true"

HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN AUSTRALIA

The Australian government’s decision to turn back hundreds of boats carrying desperate refugees is the tip of an iceberg of cruelty. Now even this country’s asylum-seekers are being denied entry

by

Penny Young

THE TIMES, JULY 25

.

Australian authorities deny that they are turning away asylum seekers. They have called in the navy to intimidate boats, and the army to man an immigration camp near Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. Thousands of people who have dared to come by boat are languishing in detention centres on Nauru and Manus Island. But Australia’s policy is, in fact, de facto deportation, which is what any country would have to do if it was to prevent large numbers of men, women and children from drowning at sea.

The case is a continuation of a legal battle that began when Panetti’s lawyers successfully challenged the TDCJ’s practice of not allowing those with mental illness or the diminished capacity to appreciate the criminality of the offense to be present at hearings deciding their fates.

Abstract
The popularity of augmented reality based games such as Pokémon Go has been growing over the last couple of years. The rise in this interest has led to increased interest in the potential for related crash-related injuries in the real world. However, there is no established mechanism to describe what types of injuries are linked to a particular game.
To examine this, researchers in Arizona recorded a single case of ""Pokémon Go-related crash"" among patients experiencing motor vehicle crashes. The case involved a 19-year-old male who rolled his pickup truck into a drainage ditch adjacent to a road. The driver was found under his vehicle, which was stuck underneath him.
One of his passengers was located underneath the truck's wheel in an unnatural position, with the wheel above his chest.
Two other passengers had lacerations to their faces and were taken to the emergency room."

73743,4,"In 2000, a Scottish Labour MSP, Gillian Martin, campaigned on behalf of her constituents, who were upset when the local authority in her constituency refused to fit seat belts on public transport to children, arguing that the cost of fitting seatbelts was more than the saving to the local authority of the likely reduction in hospital admissions caused by reduced head injuries as a result. Martin successfully campaigned for a law to be passed requiring the fitting of seatbelts on public transport carrying school children.

Martin's first bill in the Scottish Parliament after winning a seat at the 2003 elections failed to achieve much success due to widespread opposition from the transport industry and its unions, as well as from politicians such as the late Gordon Brown who argued that the wearing of seatbelts in cars had been sufficiently proven already.  The original wording of the bill was also criticised as too prescriptive in terms of its details and too prescriptive in terms of its timing. As a result a draft bill was formulated, which was more in tune with the current political climate, and the Scottish Parliament passed this in June 2005.

The original bill was then amended further, with many of the more prescriptive provisions from the original version removed and the provision relating to excursion coaches"

``` 46-year-old Sylvan Parry, of Caernarfon, Gwynedd, denied trying to kill his wife Fiona on 3 September.
But a jury at Mold Crown Court found him guilty by a majority of 10 to two, on Thursday.
Judge Eleri Rees directed that jurors could give a majority verdict after two hours and fifteen minutes of deliberations.
She added that Parry would be sentenced on Friday.
Mother-of-six, Mrs Parry, suffered life-changing injuries in the attack.
Speaking outside court, following the verdict, she said: ""I hope he does get a life sentence for what he has done to me.""
The prosecution earlier told the court Mr Parry used ""considerable force"" and only stopped when on-duty fire officers who had witnessed the attack intervened.

Dear Editor,

This summer's drought has been bad for several reasons. In our area, severe drought conditions have lasted for months. During the early stages of the drought, as the crop failed, we received some rain, but it simply wasn't enough to make any difference. The water tables have become extremely low, so even when it rains, it doesn't help much.

We have suffered severe loss of crops, resulting in large financial losses, high feed costs (hay or alfalfa feed has tripled in price) and poor pastures for grazing. There are also many economic consequences:

First, the cattle have been eating so much grain to try to keep them from starving that when they don't eat enough corn they get very sick because of the lack of digestible protein in their diet. We have to get expensive injectable vitamin and mineral injections to treat them.

The Ivory Coast goalkeeper was on his line quickly to clear the ball, but he had to leave his area to do so.

The game was between the Ivory Coast and Ghana, The Elephants were the underdogs playing at home and the Black Stars were the favourites. Both teams knew that a win was all-but essential and so it proved to be. In a tightly-contested game, neither side was able to break the deadlock and the game looked destined for a 0-0 scoreline. But with 4 minutes of the game to go, Wilfried Bony rose in-field to find a little space, then unleashed a blistering strike which bounced off the post, but Gyan was there at the far post to head into the goal to give the Ivorians the lead.

The only problem was that Bony would have been well offside had he not put the finish behind the Ghana backline -- and that’s exactly what happened. That goal would prove crucial to the outcome, as the Ivorians continued to press. They continued, despite their star striker being ineffective and their captain unable to impose himself. This would prove decisive and the African title was in the Ivory Coast after 120 goalless minutes.

Article:  Social network Twitter has become the first company to be awarded $2m in a patent dispute involving online services like Skype. The US Patent and Trademark Office said it was reasonable that some of the features that now appear in social networks were patented by Twitter, which now owns more than 3,600 patents in total. This could force other competing services like Skype or  Google Plus and, in the long term,  threaten Facebook.  The patent covers ""a user-configured, real-time stream of social network communications that is automatically delivered to a user's device or client machine over a client-to-server communications network.""  In its recent US$1bn-plus cash influx, the San-Francisco based company has started to snap up more of its competitors' patents. Twitter claims it has received approval from ""dozens of companies"" to licence those patents, and that its approach will help protect the broader online communications industry.   ```                        ```"

On the surface, the idea sounds great: Users can benefit from a little nudging of information they might already be interested in.

The problem is that users didn't explicitly choose that information.

This information is determined by algorithms behind the scenes; a product like Google Now represents a major shift in the way we think about news, and represents the future of the world's major news aggregators. What is a News Feed?

Long Island Power Authority is charging consumers double for the

The move was blasted by customers who say the company is
overcharging them even though Sandy knocked out power to
hundreds of thousands of people in the greater New York metropolitan

'LIPA is ripping off people and their customers,' said Ron Fuchs, whose home never lost electricity

Then, in 2015, the Met wrote to Brittan, asking the peer to provide any evidence concerning the matter, and saying he would be arrested if he did not co-operate with their inquiry. In this light, they felt that he too needed to be told the case had been dropped, because as a former home secretary, Lord Brittan could be named and he felt it was important that he was not arrested. The police also apologised for not informing the peer sooner. Lord Brittan passed away before this correspondence reached him, however, so was unaware he had not been arrested. He died in January 2015 and the case was dropped in December 2015.

The Millers are close to completing two double summer transfers to add to their attacking options – and long-serving player Simon Clark, who has been assistant manager to Charlton boss Karl Robinson for three years, is expected to remain at the club.

A deal for in-form Brentford attacking midfielder Michael Doughty could be completed within 48 hours.

Rotherham manager Paul Warne wants to sign Doughty to add some creativity to his side.

Warne is also seeking a right-back and a natural striker for his back-to-basics approach that is seeing his side become an attractive proposition for free agents with offers from as far and wide as Spain.

Warne and Clark are close to agreeing terms with the club and are keen to add experience in these areas. But with wages exceeding the Championship average, Charlton are looking to reduce costs.

The club’s vice-chairman Tony Jimenez said on Wednesday: “We want to improve on what we have achieved at this club in the last two years. And when I say improving on, I mean competing with. We want to be competing with the"

Despite the deal being finalised, the sale of the club from Phil Gartside to the trio of Khaled al-Fayed, Bahrain’s king Abdullah and Prince Abdullah bin Walid al-Saud looks set to be rejected by the league.

However, a statement posted on the club’s official website said Bolton were “delighted to announce the club has reached an agreement in principle for the sale of 100% of the shares to a consortium which includes Mr. Khaled al-Fayed”.

According to the 2011 UK Census 'White British' is the majority in only 3 boroughs of London

White Britons are now a minority in the capital with 620,000 leaving in a decade, according to a report on the findings of the last UK Census.

A total of 8.2 million people were recorded for London in 2011, with 4.3 million identifying as a British white, compared to 4.3 million (62.9%) in 2001.

This means that the white British population of London is down by a quarter in a decade.

The BBC revealed the findings of the report, which it said is to help understand how the ""ethnic make up"" of the capital has changed since 2001.

The Census reveals that the biggest fall in proportion of white Britons in London over the last decade was in Newham, where there was a 37.5% drop in the proportion of residents who described themselves as white British. Between 2001 and 2011, residents also changed their ethnic mix in seven other London boroughs, such as Westminster, Tower Hamlets and Hackney."

It was a detailed, but superficial look at where white Britons go to live across the UK and the United States. On page 10 of the report it mentioned that 620,000 white Britons left London between 2001 and 2011. The BBC did not do any research on where those 610,000 people left to go. It doesn’t say. There was no effort to find out what happened to them. A typical story in the mainstream media, or the media at large, is that white Britons are fleeing London in high numbers because of its rising multiculturalism and increasing crime rate.

The German artist Michael Sailstorfer placed the bars on the beach at the outer harbour of the seaside town Folkestone as part of an art project. The searches started at 4pm on Thursday with 150 people arriving to begin digging.
Sailingtorfer, who is a father of two, is in a long-distance relationship with an American.
The bars weigh 5.6 kilograms (12 pounds).
Sailstorfer is a popular sculptor in New York but his works in the States were bought at auction by art collectors.
The artist has been based in Kent since 2010 when he completed a sculpture of the HMS Warrior commissioned by the National Maritime Museum of Greenwich.
The bars have a face value of £10,000, but Sailstorfer has added to the cache of gold.
Artists have deliberately covered their works with layers of gold, so-called encrustations, in the past to prevent theft or to increase the value of the artwork when they are auctioned later.
Sailstorfer's work in Germany is often the result of collaboration.

A GOLD-rush has hit a seaside town - after a German artist buried £10,000 worth of bullion as part of an arts festival.
Hundreds of amateur treasure hunters flocked to a beach at Folkestone, Kent earlier today in a bid to get their hands on a share of the solid gold deliberately buried in the sand.
Excited children with their parents, hobby archeologists and competitive teens packed the beach at low tide to try and find the hidden bullion.
Scroll down for video.
Some treasure hunters believe that using a bigger shovel is the most effective way of finding the gold. While others have been digging in a more delicate and controlled manner akin to archaeology.
More than 250 treasure hunters tried their luck earlier today digging on their own mini claims on the beach. Sculptor Michael Sailstorfer has concealed 30 24-carat gold bars on the beach at the outer harbour of the English Channel town as an art project."

Following the June 6 jury conviction of former CAA agent Mark Micco following an explosion that injured the legendary producer in 2003, the Los Angeles District Attorney has filed charges against another one of Dre’s business associates, Rick Ross’s former manager, Darrell “Daz” Bennett, the Los Angeles Times reports. Last Friday, Bennett and Micco were each charged with five felony accounts related to the explosion. This includes one charge of attempted murder and one count each of reckless and deliberate conduct likely to produce great and special bodily injury. After the incident, Bennett told TMZ he was in his back yard and his daughter was using some sort of propane tank as a back massager. The propane tank blew up, but Daz was not injured.

Two teenagers were arrested on Thursday afternoon (January 17) and later released, after being charged with incitement to racial hatred.
Colin White, 19, from Edinburgh, and a 17-year-old from the Ayrshire town of Kilwinning, Ayrshire, were accused of posting threatening and intimidating graffiti, which was discovered in a Facebook post, on the eleventh night of the annual Twelfth of July celebrations. The graffiti included references to Islam and Judaism, and contained derogatory and homophobic slurs.
The teenagers, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are expected to appear at Ayr Police Office in March to face the charges.
Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Monday (January 21) warned the teenagers that they could be jailed on indictment in three months after they admitted displaying written material which was likely to incite hatred or cause fear.
Mr Justice Paul Scrutton noted that: ""In my judgment, you are, frankly, lucky that you were not arrested at your homes.

82279,1,"Exile on the moon

In the early 19th Century, the concept of witchcraft had taken on a new twist. Many contemporary intellectuals were fascinated by “magical” powers. Even though the witch hunt had ended, those that thought differently were still persecuted. In a letter to his son published in 1810, Voltaire described a dream in which he went to the moon and saw “witch doctors” performing a ritual to capture children to use for medical experiments. Even though he was not convinced that black magic actually existed, the philosopher was in awe of magic and believed that he could harness the moon’s magic for good.

Jules Verne had written fiction concerning travel to and on the moon in his novel From the Earth to the Moon (1873) and many other novelists began to follow suit. As popular culture became more romanticised, the witch hunt had been replaced with an investigation into black magic and sorcery. In 1761, Madame de Sevigne published the first chapter of her novel, The Vile Village: or, the City in the Country. She wrote that the citizens were still accusing those accused of witchcraft, saying that they “were witches… and were the cause of the mischief which had be"
82279,2,"The witch is seen as a powerful, beautiful woman and, while she is powerful, she is also seductive. The power to enchant men and transform them into animals is associated with the female erotic impulse. This exhibition examines the witchcraft of the Middle Ages, and the fear this fear instilled.  It examines the image of the witch as a young woman, seduceress and powerful sorceress, as she exists in paintings and prints. It examines how the witch has evolved in different cultures through different media - from medieval illuminated texts and paintings, through the Renaissance and Baroque periods, up to the 19th century.  It examines how witchcraft and its representation in media has been a subject of contention and dispute through the centuries and how it has become an object of fear.  It also examines the different social classes and why the persecution of witches has been largely directed against women.  Witch hunts continued well into the 19th century in European countries such as Denmark, Belgium, Spain and France. A few countries, such as Sweden and Norway, became havens for witches after legal persecution of the witch had become increasingly unpopular.  Finally, it examines the witch hunts through the lenses of art, literature, film and mythology.''

A large part of that has been down to the manager''s man-management skills. It can be argued that Martinez''s best work at his previous club Wigan Athletic centered around his man-management skills, too. What was it then that convinced Everton management to hire the Dutch coach as manager in a summer that looked barren, given a number of vacancies in the Premier League''s top flight? The club spent the summer looking for the right way forward, but no top-flight clubs were prepared to part with their manager in the knowledge that they were set to lose him to a European club. It was not that Wigan did not want to keep him, but they believed they could not pay the £2m salary he was demanding. That was the moment when Everton came calling, offering him a cut-price £9m salary package to be a replacement for David Moyes. It was the lowest offer, but they made it to a man they trusted and believed in to turn their season around. If Everton continue in the fashion that they are currently doing under Roberto Martinez, then they will"

38144,2,"Everton have to avoid the trap of thinking they will make early progress if they are to challenge for top four. They have to stop focusing on one target, but think about the long-term progress. The team has played well under manager Martinez, but the manager is aware that in the Premier League anything can happen - a slip-up can change everything. The pressure is on them not to throw away any opportunities they get to achieve the target of a top-four finish; they should not be thinking they are already there. Everton, who are in the final Europa League spot, remain unbeaten under Martinez. Martinez's men have made four signings in the January transfer window, and look set to complete more signings in the coming weeks. Martinez will not be spending heavily on new players, as he had at the start of the season, but will target a player for a small fee with huge potential. The club, though, are not expected to make any major sales before the end of the transfer window.''"

Everton captain Howard, reflecting on the 3-0 Boxing Day defeat by Stoke, said the “calm demeanour” of Martinez, an affable 50-year-old Spaniard, allows the squad to take a deep breath after a poor run of six defeats in the past seven games and he expects the players will do the same when they travel to Newcastle on Sunday.  As Everton prepare to face Newcastle at St James’ Park, they have slipped to 12th, eight points from a Champions League place following some poor away performances in which they have scored one goal in five attempts. They are three points behind Tottenham in fifth, the Champions League qualification berth, and six behind fifth-place Liverpool.  “He’s a calm individual, but he’s passionate,” Howard said. “He never allows anybody out of line, which is great because there’s nobody who wants to do anything out of line, so it just calms the room a little bit. “You have the carrot out here, but at the end of"

The teen triumphed alongside Laura Gratton after a dramatic encounter with South African duo Leana de Beer and Caryn Shinnick.

It was an emotional occasion for both sides.

With the South African flag out flying at the end of the six difficult dives, it had looked like a golden home victory for de Beer and Shinnick.

But a strong final dive from Gratton, who had failed to qualify for the individual event due to poor form, saw her and Toulson finish their routine with a total of 284.55 points.

Founded as the fundamentalist Ulster Unionist Party in 1905, the DUP was a key supporter of the Union between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK from 1921, and has been pro-life since the start.
The DUP's anti-gay policies have attracted criticism and protests and led some to describe it as retrograde.
The DUP voted against gay marriage in 2013, but has since voted in favour of equal civil marriage, though it doesn't recognise it. It was the only party to oppose the same-sex marriage legislation in Northern Ireland in 2014.
Northern Ireland has its own abortion laws that deviate from the rest of the UK. As with gay marriage, its abortion laws have been a bone of contention, even with the party's leader, Arlene Foster. The DUP has previously voted against reform.
Foster has been the party's leader since December 2013 and has been its deputy since 2015. She is also deputy first minister in the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland.

A Norfolk man has had a lucky escape after being on his way to work when he won a multi-million pound fortune on the National Lottery – he bought his Lottery ticket in Norfolk just hours before he won a lifetime's wage.

Michael Carroll, 47, from Hethersett, was working as a crane operator in the yard of a building site in Cambridge when he called off work for the morning and went the shop to buy his ticket – he was so certain he won £6,000, he didn't bother scratching.

But he was absolutely bemused when he checked his numbers and it turned out that with an extra number added, he had a mammoth £9.7million winner.

Helmut Kohl is dead at 85
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl dies at age 85

He is credited with bringing East and West Germany together after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

He was Germany's leader from 1982 to 1998, and his 16-year-long tenure made him the country's longest-serving post-war chancellor.
He led Germany into the European Union - and helped unite his country a generation after the end of the Second World War.

With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, he famously said that the city had been ""liberated"" by East Germans.
The former chancellor also used his position to encourage the EU's expansion into central Europe, a cause he championed for 16 years.
His death was announced by his party, which said he died in ""his home in Ludwigshafen"".
It said the cause of his death would be made public at 09:55 local time (6:55 GMT).

He was born on 22 March 1930, two months after Adolf Hitler's appointment as Chancellor of Germany.

He was appointed Chancellor of Germany in 1982 in an emergency situation – after the then Chancellor, the Social Democrat, Walter Hallstein, had suffered a fatal heart attack and President Franz Josef Strauss, then 83, was no longer able to rule. He stepped down after 16 years in 1998, in the wake of an electoral defeat.

As Chancellor, he presided over the reunification of Germany in 1990 and the subsequent establishment of German-dominated EU structures.

He was a major player in the formation and implementation of the common European currency, the euro.

He was personally disliked by the right wing because of perceived liberalism but, in Germany as elsewhere, his influence will almost certainly be greatly diminished by the lack of an obvious successor to the CDU leadership.

34006,3,"The Cochno Stone  at Faiffley in Clydebank is a prehistoric stone which has been deliberately
buried during the 1960s, under the ground level, in the process of making an
important road from the Clydeside.
This is considered to be the most significant of the early Bronze Age monuments in the
Paisley area, and has been designated a Scheduled Historic Monument.
There is a replica stone, the Cochno Stone, at the National Trust property of Caerlaverock.

The Cochno Stone

The Cochno Stone represents the earliest type of engraving dating from the Bronze Age.
Its unusual appearance is explained by Neolithic, Bronze age, and even some Roman coinage
carved on the slab.

The slab was originally located at
the site of the Cochno Barrow, an earthwork mound associated with the early Bronze Age
people. The barrow appears on earlier and later maps.

The earliest traces of the barrow are from the neolithic period, circa 3500 - 3000 BC.
The mound was abandoned during the middle neolithic period, around 2700 BC.
The mound was re-occupied circa 2000 BC"

In his report published on Thursday 14 June the communications commissioner, Sir Aontán May, confirms that the British Government has powers to conduct surveillance on both UK and international communications to and from people living here and abroad.

Sir Aontán May acknowledges that there can be very good reasons to authorise some of this surveillance.  He has set out very clearly how these powers are exercised and how there is a balance to be struck between the requirements of terrorism, crime-fighting and national security.  But he finds some of the claims made by the whistleblower, Edward Snowden, concerning his agencies’s powers are not justified.

The Snowden disclosures showed that GCHQ is able to tap the vast majority of international communications between or among UK citizens and people overseas.  But the interception commissioner has been able to examine the agency’s operations and has not seen any evidence to suggest that this is being done in secret with very little public understanding.  He says that in GCHQ’s 40 plus year history there has been one exception where some communications have been ‘selectively accessed’.  This limited breach, which involved tapping cables in France, has now been rectified.

To those interested in mass immigration, criminality and pension security, it declares, vote AfD on Sunday ""so that Germany is not destroyed"".
AfD refers to Alternative for Germany, and is a populist, Eurosceptic party, founded just three years ago and already the country's fastest-growing political movement.
If the latest polls are anything to go by, the AfD is, for the first time, ahead of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) here in her home state, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania.
With the CDU also losing support in Berlin, which holds elections later this month, September could represent a significant milestone in Mrs Merkel's long political journey, as she ponders running for a remarkable fourth term as chancellor next year.

Leibovitz, 51, put her art, intellectual property and even real estate assets up for collateral last year when she consolidated her massive debts. Art Capital Group, which restructured the debts, says Leibovitz agreed ""to make Art Capital her `irrevocable exclusive agent' of the collateral... to recover the amount Art Capital was obligated to make under her secured debt agreements for a reduced interest rate.""

Now the company is suing Leibovitz for breach of contract, saying she has ""refused to cooperate in the sale of those assets,"" according to a question-and-answer sheet on the lawsuit issued by Art Capital. It also says she has ""refused to pay to Art Capital hundreds of thousands of dollars she owed as part of the same agreement.""

  This film version will have a new cast, a new director, and a new budget.
  Despite this, some people still claim the ""Thunderbirds"" name is too popular to be associated with a remake.
  Despite being called 'Thunderbirds Are Go!' the remake will not be a cartoon.
  Those claiming this will make the new show 'diluted' in quality are incorrect, as the whole project has been heavily revamped to bring it into line with the original.
  A few people argue the money spent on the remake should have been better spent on the original - specifically the live-action one which still languishes in development hell despite a number of directors taking the project on.

  The new Thunderbirds TV series will be set in the modern day.
  This gives the show more scope to explore the characters.
  The CGI is a vital part of the TV show format, and can be used to tell a different kind of story.
  The CGI characters will look somewhat different to the way they look in the original series.

The alleged chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun on Wednesday - which allegedly killed at least 89 people - was the latest in a series of chemical weapons attacks the Syrian government has carried out in the conflict that has raged for five years.

What is the nature of the conflict?

Syria used to be a relatively stable country. Its government, based in the capital Damascus, is backed by the military strongman Bashar al-Assad, who has ruled since his father, Hafez al-Assad, took power in 1970.

Syria's civil war has morphed into a proxy war between its two main allies, Russia to the north and Iran to the west. US forces are also present in Syria to combat Islamic State (IS) jihadists, who control large swathes of territory in the east.

As well as Russia, Iran and the US, other key players in the conflict are Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which have backed rival opposition groups. Turkey backs rebels of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), while Saudi Arabia supports the Islamic Front (Islamist rebel coalition).

You have seen what they can do in the last 10 days against Celtic but I thought we should have had enough quality to get three from the tie."" After the game, Hamilton manager Martin Canning said: ""I don't think we were overly surprised by that [the scoreline] from what we saw on Friday night, there is no doubt there was an element of us being back to ourselves again after the Celtic game.""

  Hearts v Hamilton               Summary :
    Hearts went ahead through Bobby Zlamal when a Hamilton
    clearance ricocheted into his path, and he had time to control
    the ball and rattle it past McGovern. Three minutes later, however,
    Hearts went down to 10 men when Ian Black was adjudged to have
    brought down Lyon on the edge of the area, after an altercation
    with David Templeton. Bobby Madden issued Rossi with a second caution,
    and then booked Templeton.

It wasn\'t Hearts first game against Hamilton Academical, just their first game this season as opposed to last season. The previous game took place at Hamilton Academical in October 2008, in which Hearts won 1-0. Hamilton scored with an own goal.
Hearts have played Hamilton Academical seven times since their initial match in the first season of the First Division, 1955-56. They have drawn four and lost three of those seven, with one game ending 0-0. These seven games between the teams have occurred across four seasons/four competitive campaigns, which is as far as the record goes.

78686,2,"Manuel Pellegrini must sort out his defence. With City playing poorly at the back this season, they need to stop shipping goals. The main problem is the centre-half pairing of Eliaquim Mangala and Vincent Kompany. These two players need to show an understanding of their responsibilities at the back and be in sync, but that is not happening. Mangala started the season off well and looked the real deal but has since dipped and there does not seem to be a consensus about whether either central defender is good enough to be a regular starter at this level. Kompany is still getting back to form and has not been fit enough to start regularly. Fernando has looked woeful at times this year and should leave the club sooner rather than later. If Mangala was a regular starter, I think he would flourish, but when both of these players are involved the position of the defender at the back is never secure.'' ~~~

The manager has plenty of issues to address if the Citizens are to recover their form this season

Manchester City were on the verge of a great end-of-year run. The Citizens had won 11 of their previous 12 matches in domestic competition, their only poor showing that a 2-0 loss to Arsenal on September 21, to go with their 11-1 aggregate victory over Sporting Lisbon in the UEFA Champions League's group phase. They had not tasted defeat since, and were on the verge of making it a clean sweep, as they headed to Upton Park for their second Premier League game of the month, having seen their rivals, Man United, lose to Aston Villa earlier in that week. They had already beaten Norwich City by three goals with nine men last week—one of three straight wins in October—and looked to be the team to beat.

That's all changed since. City sit a disappointing fifth in the Premier League going into their match on the last day of November. Their home form has been woeful,"

The term ""closet"" is not the same as just calling oneself a homosexual in a world where, according to the US Census Bureau, the number of Americans who identify as homosexual has been steadily increasing in recent decades (see above-right graph).

On October 20, 2010, during a debate between Republican presidential candidates Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney aired on CNN, Gingrich said, ""There's no moral equivalence between a culture that would tell children they should be ashamed of being gay and that would force a 15-year-old to be a prostitute.

The film shows the man approaching Mrs Jodrell Lomas, 41, in a supermarket car park in Stoke Heath, Birmingham. Mrs Lomas is seen covering her children’s faces with her arms and begging the man to stop. As she walks away, she then turns back and tells the man “get off me” as he raises his arm and attempts to pull her to the ground. She then runs towards her car and locks the doors before getting out. The footage was taken in July last year and shows the man, who has now been charged with attacking his estranged wife, walking out of the supermarket to pursue the woman. Although the three children in the video are obscured, they can be seen with Mrs Lomas as they escape the scene.

McIlroy to miss Open Championship

The European Tour is facing a major test with Rory McIlroy threatening not to play the Open Championship this year. Rory McIlroy is the highest-ranked golfer not to be playing in the Open at St Andrews. The Northern Irishman is fourth in both the FedEx Cup and the US Masters. The top four players in each division automatically qualify for the Open as a result of the ranking system. Four other players will pick up berths from the world rankings. For McIlroy, whose win at the US Masters secured him a place in America's top four and a direct entry into the 2013 US Open, the issue boils down to the number of tournaments he wants to play at the end"

The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia recently ruled that the Kennedy family must reveal the identity of the anonymous owner of an old condolence letter from the late Jacqueline Kennedy. The order is a legal first and a stunning defeat for the Kennedys, who fought court after court to keep the mystery man and why the letter?s existence was a secret. The letter, which the Kennedys won?t divulge for nearly a half million dollars at auction, is more of a mystery than you might expect. Though written by Mrs. Kennedy shortly after the assassination of her husband and brother-in-law, Robert F. Kennedy, and President John F. Kennedy, it carries no apparent political significance. Instead, it is filled with a seemingly personal and heartfelt tribute to Mrs. Kennedy?s sister-in-law, Ethel Kennedy, who was the widow of the president?s brother, Bobby. The last line of the letter reads: ""My own thoughts and prayers are with you at this time."""

Censorship: Computer scientists Jed Crandall and Dan Wallach found that some posts are deleted after five minutes of being posted.

In the process, they often undermine the underlying social order by, for example, promoting minority views, fostering social movements, and undermining the government's legitimate policy authority. This in turn undermines the legitimacy of many of the political and policy choices involved in governing China.```

The airline said it was in close consultation with Airbus, though it did not say exactly how many aircraft were affected by the problem. Airbus said checks on affected planes had revealed similar problems, and had identified some additional parts on other models of its passenger jets that also needed attention. The planemaker said that it would recommend the repair plan in an alert to the European Union Air Safety Agency on Friday, and that it would be up to individual carriers to decide whether to fly affected planes or not.

35044,1,"New Urine-Based Tests Can Detect UTI Disease Earlier

Scientists from the University of East Anglia (UEA) say they have developed a urine-based device that can detect urinary tract infection (UTI) more quickly and accurately than existing tests. They say the device could lead to faster treatment and better use of antibiotics.

""If a bacterial infection is detected and treated early, it will usually go away without damaging the renal, reproductive or other health system"", said Dr Justin O'Grady, a researcher at the UEA Norwich Medical School in Norwich. The current gold standard for detecting a UTI is a "" urine culture "". This method can take up to four days before diagnosis can be made, and an infection may have by then spread to the bladder, vagina and/or bloodstream, by which time it is often beyond the control of antibiotics.

The new device was being unveiled during this week's Annual Meeting of the American Society of Microbiology in San Diego. It is based on a tiny cartridge that contains all the components needed to do a 'high sensitivity' rapid diagnostic test for bacteria. It can be inserted directly into patient urine samples and can be applied anywhere in the world. The test consists of three separate reagents that can detect"
35044,2,"Scientists at the University of East Anglia (UEA) say a device the size of a USB stick could replace traditional methods for monitoring and treating urinary tract infections (UTIs) four times more quickly, and could also help identify resistant bacteria. They have developed a new technology that can detect bacteria from urine samples four times more quickly than traditional methods. This could help make sure that the right antibiotic is given to the right patient as early as possible in the treatment of bacterial infections. The results of an initial proof of concept study of the technique are being unveiled at the American Society of Microbiology annual meeting in San Diego this week. The results will be presented by Dr Justin O'Grady and Professor David Livermore, from UEA's Norwich Medical School. Currently the most effective way to treat UTI is to take a urine sample and then use a simple test to identify whether it contains bacteria - and only then begin treatment with an antibiotic. This is the ""carpet-bombing"" approach, but it means patients are often treated with antibiotics that are not as effective against resistant strains of bacteria. Dr O'Grady and Professor Livermore have been working on the development of a device that makes the detection of bacterial cells much faster, even at low levels. By adding"

The device was described at the International Conference on Microbial Diseases held in San Diego on November 22.. UEA scientist Prof David Livermore said they needed to move beyond ""carpet-bombing"" bacterial detection procedures. He said: ""The way to do so lies in accelerating laboratory investigation, so that treatment can be refined earlier, benefitting the patient, who gets an effective antibiotic, and society, whose diminishing stock of antibiotics is better managed.""`

The BBC and Jeremy Paxman have defended the level of difficulty of this year's University Challenge - and insisted claims that it is getting easier are not true.

BBC controller of programmes Jane Turton said the questions had become ""more difficult"" over the years, but was backed by BBC2 controller Danny Cohen.

They argued that the number of questions in the programme - including ""bonus rounds"" - had increased, giving the more than 11 million viewers of this year's version a tougher and more exciting programme.

However, the criticism has raised doubts over the extent to which the level of difficulty has actually changed.

Mastermind contestant Ed Balls - who has been heavily criticised for lacking basic knowledge - is one of 11 contestants who will be competing on the programme. He was mocked for his ""baffling"" answers by the team from University College London, who he partnered with, and presenter John Humphrys.

BBC bosses have now issued a response to the controversy over Balls' answers to questions from the quiz.

Plans for this Spanish invasion were drawn up for King Carlos IV by the Count of Barcelona, Vice Admiral of the fleet and the main naval commander of the expedition. They intended an invasion would be launched from the Philippines. The fleet would be led by a group of frigates and would travel through South America and the Pacific. In early April 1794, the fleet reached the Philippine Islands. They sent messages to Governor Don Pedro de Castilla requesting that he leave immediately. The Governor refused, and so the Spanish decided to make the Philippines their staging post. He sent a letter, which was intercepted, to King Carlos IV pleading his case. In early February 1794, the Spanish had completed the construction of a vessel, La Pinta, as a vessel to land troops.

Bishop seeks answers over death of Australians in Iraq

The Australian government is attempting to confirm reports the execution of two Australian teenagers in Iraq were a ''set-up'' by the Islamic State (IS), Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told Parliament.

However, she insisted Australia had no ''concrete evidence'' to suggest the group had a role in the deaths of 18-year-old Mohamed Khaled Elomar and his 19-year-old brother, Abdul Hamid.

""The Australian government has very serious concerns about those reported deaths, and will continue to investigate further, so we can verify the report with all necessary speed.

On Saturday, the government of Chad announced its withdrawal of troops from the ""Sahara Autonomous"" territory in Western Sahara.
The withdrawal is said to comply with the United Nations mandate. Chad's Ministry of Foreign Affairs cited the ""widespread political sensitivities"" regarding the issue. The Sahara autonomy was set up in the 1990s by Chadian leader Hissène Habré.

The withdrawal of Chadian troops comes a year after the Moroccan army began its incursion into the ""zone of confidence"" between the Moroccan side and the UN forces. The intrusion was deemed by the international community to be an act of provocation.
The UN's efforts in Western Sahara had become increasingly difficult to handle. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who succeeded Kofi Annan last month, repeatedly urged the parties involved to resolve their differences.
The Sahara autonomy, which was headed by Hissène Habré himself, is a self-governance program to deal with the issues of unemployment, corruption, and poverty in the so-called ""Sahara of poverty.""

There is no immediate risk of war or escalation, with the announcement of a unilateral Moroccan pullout that was apparently made in person by King Mohammed VI.
The Polisario has dismissed Morocco's move as ""a gimmick"" and condemned the Moroccan king's move as a ploy to undermine efforts to find a solution for the disputed territory.
""The Royal Moroccan government decision to withdraw its troops from the buffer zone in Guerguerat is but one step in the long and complex road towards an inclusive political solution,"" said Omar Abou El Fadl, general delegate of the Polisario Front.

Chile is aiming to capitalize on a wave of foreign direct investment by introducing its charms to the many business executives and corporate leaders now choosing the nation as a base from which to do business.

""For years we've had the image of only being a great place for skiing,"" he explained. ""But now with this initiative people are discovering that there's a whole lot more to do with this beautiful country.""

Santiago is one of three capitals in the country and is the biggest, but in the past few years it has emerged as a major tourist magnet, boosted by a vibrant nightlife scene that has developed around the city. This boom came about as many expats living and working in Chile left the capital for better opportunities in the provinces and as business people came and stayed for longer periods. Many have now left Santiago, and to attract the best and brightest tourists to the city, the Chile Tourism Commission has opened a new office in the up-market district of Condesa in the heart of the city, hoping that business executives will be enticed to spend more time at home in Santiago by the city's thriving nightlife. In June 2012, the Santiago tourist office was opened at 7th and Zona Central, with the aim of bringing visitors back to the heart of the city.''

  Chile faces a daunting future, and it will need all the tourist dollars it can get. Its economic problems go back to the 1980's, during which successive governments privatized assets at a rapid clip and embarked on a wide range of free market reforms. For example, the country had one of the most liberal and open free trade agreements in history, and the country's free flow of capital helped fuel huge economic growth. This growth was not accompanied by an expanded social safety net however, which resulted in a population whose median age peaked at 41 in 1995, and there is little sign that this age structure will start to change. The result is low birth rates and a huge deficit in the labor forces skills. Furthermore, most of Chile's population live in the south in the Andes, making it very vulnerable to climactic changes. Chile needs tourists badly, and to stay out of the clutches of the criminals who have set the agenda for much of Latin America in the last few years. But how does Chile intend to do this? By having a nice capital, nice scenery, and low prices of everything, which makes it a great spot to work.

  The detailed, and much more readable summary from Wired magazine:

_The United States launched a drone airstrike in Somalia last night against a key adviser to the jihadist group Al Shabab. The military doesn't know how many insurgents were killed or injured in the attack. The target, according to reports, was a senior Al Shabab military chief named Zakariya Ismail Ahmed Hersi, who operates under the nom de guerre of Omar Faruk Hersi, a.k.a. “Abu Usama”. Reports on the attack say the strike was carried out in the village of Saakow, located outside Galkayo, Somalia, near the Kenyan border._

_The attack comes just days after an Al Shabab-allied militia attacked a U.S. military recruiting center in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. Al Shabab has declared war on Kenya during an unprecedented spate of cross-border attacks, as well as on Somalia and Kenya's neighbors, in retaliation for a devastating U.S. drone strike in September that killed the organization's once-powerful leader, Ahmed Abdi-God"

  The strike happened on Monday, January 16, 2000, in the vicinity of Saakow, southern Somalia.
  At this time, we do not assess there to be any civilian or bystander casualties.
  We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information, when appropriate, as details become available. The airstrike may signal a shift toward precision strikes following last week’s terrorist attacks in Kenya.
  The U.S. has conducted at least 15 airstrikes against suspected al-Qaeda operatives in Somalia this year, including the one on Monday.

  A Somali military commander said forces had captured a top al-Shabaab commander, Zakariya Ismail Ahmed Hersi. CNN called his cellphone, but it went straight to voicemail; his voicemail was full.

The United States conducts about 50-50 Predator Strikes in Somalia each year. According to the U.S. Navy there have been 542 Predators flown to Somalia since December 2000.   The U.S. Navy, when asked for an official number of strikes on Al Shabaab, will not provide any"
19650,0,"Argentina's financial turmoil
by Michael Pettis

If you haven't felt the Argentinian financial turmoil, now is the time.
The country's currency, the Argentine peso, has lost half its value against the US dollar in the last 2 months.

What might seem a trivial event like a presidential election is actually huge and very important. It's been 12 years since the left-wing government of Cristina Kirchner was forced from power by a financial crisis in 2003. It was during her first term in office when Argentina's debt grew to about $220bn. It nearly brought down the entire economy.

Now, with elections fast approaching, it's the country's second economic crisis in a decade. One recent development is the rise of the right-populist Macri in the polls. Kirchner's government has lost its populist touch, and its policies have failed.
But it can still beat Macri at the polls. Her government has been able to create a false sense of stability by printing money to finance its deficits. But it can only do this short term.

The next few months will be a big test of whether the left can gain political power in the short term. The country will"

Fernandez wins 2nd term by record margin, vows to work on Argentina's social agenda

By. Leon Watson. Last updated at 1:34 PM on 24th October 2011.

Argentina's fiery president Cristina Fernandez has scored a record election win after her government spread the wealth of a booming economy.

Ms Fernandez won 53 per cent of the vote after 58 per cent of the polling stations reported nationwide. Her nearest challenger got just 17 per cent.

It was the widest margin of victory in the country's history.

Re-elected: Cristina Fernandez waves to supporters at her victory rally in Buenos Aires. Interior Minister Florencio Randazzo predicted the president's share would rise as polls reported from her party's stronghold of densely populated Buenos Aires province.

'Count on me to continue pursuing the project,' Ms Fernandez vowed in her victory speech. 'All I want is to keep collaborating... to keep Argentina growing. I want to keep changing history.'

Ms Fernandez is Latin America's first woman to be re-elected as president, but the victory was personally bitter sweet - the first without her husband and predecessor, Nestor Kirchner, who died of a heart attack last"
26173,2,"Citing figures from the electoral authorities, she went on to triumph and deliver a stern message to her opponents, saying: 'I will continue the project, and continue to cooperate with all Argentines who want to change history, and with all Argentines who aspire to that great country that we will build together.' ``

Fernandez overcame a formidable challenge by her closest competitor, business-friendly independent Carlos Melconian, a former World Bank official who got only 17 percent of the vote and said that ""only when the opposition will be united can Argentina grow.""

Fernandez was sworn in as Argentina's first female president in 2007 and won a first term in November 2009. She enjoyed strong, loyal public support that translated into a massive vote in her favor, according to initial returns that covered over 60 percent of the polling stations. Polls had shown Fernandez winning by 15 points - and one of her party leaders had predicted a landslide. ''This is a strange night for me,'' Fernandez said in her victory speech.

 ` `
There are approximately 3.9 million Americans currently unemployed, according to the Labor Department's latest report.
Today's reading indicates that the unemployment rate held steady at 6.6%.
It is the lowest unemployment rate since October 2008.
December's report indicated a gain of 74,000 new jobs. However, over the past month and a half there has been considerable volatility.
The numbers for January are much more in line with the previous two months.
According to Friday's numbers there were 115,000 new jobs in the private sector while government hiring remained steady.
Despite the improving trend, Friday's numbers were weak.
Economists had predicted the U.S. Labor Department would report an increase of 180,000 new jobs..
However, the unemployment rate fell to 6.6%, the lowest level since October 2008.
Economists say this drop is likely a result of lower than expected participation rates.
The jobless figures will raise concerns that, after strong growth in the second half of 2013, the U.S. economic recovery is beginning to lose its steam.
U.S. stocks shrugged off the news -"
75354,1,"In most countries, joblessness is on the upswing, as the economic recovery falters.
In the US, economists had also predicted that the unemployment rate would fall to around 7% - but it was actually 6.6% in January.
It's the lowest unemployment rate for five years, with the figure dropping in both the civilian and military categories.
There were still some 750,000 people who either weren't working or whose work status wasn't recorded by the labour department as unemployed.
As has been the pattern lately, retail sales and consumer confidence figures have been a little disappointing, suggesting the US recovery may not be as strong as it could be.
And, of course, the government shutdown, which is taking its toll on the US economy.
However the figures for December were revised up from 75,000 to 145,000, so the job creation in the sector is still going on at a modest pace.

What is the meaning of this ""Economists had predicted the US Labor Department would report an increase of about 180,000 new jobs."" phrase? What does it mean that an increase of 180,000 new jobs ""had been predicted""? Why does it mean that an increase of 180,000 new jobs ""had been predicted""? What were the sources of the predictions? What type of research techniques were used to make the predictions?

When people say that they made a prediction, they imply that they made a decision to believe that the prediction would come true. For example, if you predict that something will happen, you believe that it will come true.

It's important that we know which predictions actually came true. Some people predict that they will make it to work on time and arrive on time. But that is a prediction, and it usually doesn't come true.

If people consistently make predictions that aren't true, they should get their predictions wrong more often. But a lot of people seem to make predictions that aren't true and are wrong very infrequently.

Economists often make a distinction between the ""best guess"" and the ""most accurate."" In economics, the best guess can be very accurate, but you"

But the unemployment rate also dropped to its lowest level since October 2008.
The jobs figures are released jointly by US jobs department and labour department.
They will raise the prospect that the US economic recovery is losing steam.
US economic indicators have been mixed throughout 2013, with stronger growth in the second half of the year.
But many economists believe that the economy is due for a ""tapering"" - an easing off of stimulus measures - which could put a strain on the recovery.
However, if January's job creation was as weak as it appears, the effect would probably be small, with many economists suggesting that the economy needs to create 200,000 jobs to cut the national unemployment rate by 0.1%.
The unemployment figure released on Friday also does not include those who have given up looking for a job over the past month and so are therefore not counted in the unemployment rate. About 400,000 people had dropped out of the workforce by the end of December.
Employment in manufacturing rose by 21,000 despite the impact of the severe weather conditions, according to the latest official employment figures.

""Over the years, the PDNPA has undertaken a range of activities including the construction of reservoirs, the provision of visitor facilities in small woodland parks and the construction of an educational centre at Malham Quarry.

These woodlands are small, in nature conservation or geological interest - in the context of the rest of the national park they are the equivalent of the ``meadows'' in The Waste Land; and as the article points out they are often very valuable, being very well maintained, having a strong history of conservation, being in areas of some geological interest, or being valuable to a range of users, including bird-watchers, picnickers, ramblers, and foraging for the local community.

The authority, which has around 110 hectares to dispose of, says it will sell several small areas with restrictions on their use.

The authority says it will also sell some sites in the north Derbyshire area of Brimshire later in the year.

But it has been criticised by the Woodland Trust which says it is concerned about the impact of selling these large areas.

'Not fit for purpose'

The trust has written to the authorities concerned expressing concern.

Its director, Norman Starks, says: ""The loss of such large areas of well-managed woodlands would be a severe blow to the local area.
""This would have a detrimental effect on a whole range of plants and animals who require such lands for their survival.

It has recently concluded negotiations concerning the management of 12 further sites.
The PDNPA is also offering to sell an additional seven woodland sites under its ``redevelopment'' programme, which has been in development for a number of years.
There are three further sites, which have been included in the PDNPA's planning application for a Strategic Planning Reserve, which would be sold under normal development planning guidelines.
The woodlands will be sold, to the highest bidders, with restrictions affecting access and any proposed new uses.
Under the sales, the PDNPA aims to maximise the return to the community and the park as a whole; and protect the remaining woodlands for nature.

Woodlands that have been closed will be closed permanently. The sales would benefit the park authority by ''reducing liabilities'' at a time when it is cutting all public service spending by 36.5%.  No decision has been taken about whether the land would be sold over a period of time or all at once.  The authority also said it had plans to sell more than 60 hectares of woodland next year, and would monitor the sale of Woodland Trust sites closely after their sale for any change in land use or access rights. The Woodland Trust has had more than 40% funding cuts from its government backers.  The Woodland Trust said it would monitor the sale of Woodland Trust sites ''cautiously'' to ensure full controls on any changes in land and access rights for the woodlands.

12006,4,"Conservative Margo Stewart came narrowly ahead of Gwyneth Petrie of the SNP in the Huntly, Strathbogie and Howe of Alford vote.
The turnout was 34.5 %.

  It came after the death of Joanna Strathdee of the SNP and the resignation of Alastair Ross of the Lib Dems due to health reasons.
Margo Stewart got 1,469 votes, which was 36 ahead of Gwyneth Petrie on 1,433. They were followed by Lib Dem Daniel Millican with 928, Labour's Sarah Flavell on 196 and Derek Scott of the Scottish Libertarian Party with 20 votes..

  In our own view, no result here is satisfactory. If only two candidates put their name forward, I feel it is a reflection on the current make up of the council. On the other hand, the fact that two parties stand for election demonstrates the interest and demand in Huntly, Strathbogie and Howe area. I would say the people of this area will now have to settle for one of the following two candidates: Daniel Millican, Gwyneth Petrie or Margo Stewart. In my opinion, all three have proven themselves to be conscientious and dedicated councillors.

A report that the Ukrainian army has recaptured Krasnyi Luch may be incorrect. The rebels do control most of Donetsk Oblast, and control Luzhansk Oblast, where Krasnyi Luch is located.

The report that an “urgent action to avert an impending humanitarian crisis” has been called for by Russia will most likely have no effect on the ongoing developments around Donetsk and Mariupol. Russia has repeatedly made similar calls during the course of the conflict.

If the rebels are already encircled, the Ukrainian Army needs to break through them in order for them to retreat to Luhansk Oblast.

1892,3,"Chris Brown : Ebola Is A Form Of Population Control, Says the R&B Singer

Three minutes after the tweet, following criticism from some of his 13.6 million followers, he backtracked.

By Jason HirschhornLos Angeles Times

August 3, 2014

     R&B singer Chris Brown was ridiculed for a bizarre tweet alleging that the Ebola virus is a ""form of population control.""

A few minutes after the message, with accompanying photo, was sent on Saturday afternoon, following criticism from some of his 13.6 million followers, he backtracked and said: ""Let me shut my black a** up!""

His first post received nearly 9,500 retweets and has not been deleted by the singer.

It did not take long for people to notice Brown's tweet, with dozens of people criticizing his odd conspiracy theory. Comedian Warren Holstein tweeted: ""Chris Brown tweeted that Ebola is ""a form of population control."" He should try it."" Kevin Hildebrand said: ""Let's keep in mind that Chris Brown is a complete idiot, so his theory of Ebola is equal to a rant from a village idiot."" Wayne Durham tweeted: ""The stupidity gene is strong"

The singer tweeted his thoughts on the epidemic, which has killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa as well as one person in the U.S. Brown wrote: ""I don't know... But I think this Ebola epidemic is a form of population control. S*** is getting crazy bruh."" He deleted the tweet and said he had wanted to ""shut my black a** up."" In his original tweet, he said his thoughts were that ""This was planned all along... they didn't have nothing to do with a man dying in America but it was just a good chance for a scare"".

Administrators say the schools chapter of an international organization of Greek-letter groups will be able to continue but are not allowing new members to become student pledges, a rite of passage some say is often abused.

Administrators say they will allow students who have become recognized alumni to rejoin the groups or to start new chapters elsewhere.

The European Tour began in May 1968 in the United Kingdom. This tournament has been held every year except in 2001, when the event became a co-sanctioned event with the US, and again in 2006.

  This year's tournament is the 53rd edition.

  This year's tournament features 132 professional golfers from 42 countries.

In 1998, the French team won the Ryder Cup by beating the United States 19–9.

The Frenchman has been the tournament's most exciting player all week, and his three-stroke overnight lead was intact until he found the water on the 16th hole, dropping him down the leaderboard. Alejandro Canizares recovered superbly - though briefly - to complete a final round of one-over-par 73 at Le Golf National in Paris and finish second on eight under for this year's event, just three shots clear of Steve Webster. The Spaniard has been playing so well this week that there was no need to expect him to lose his lead, and so it proved that he did not even lose any ground to Webbo this afternoon. Indeed, he recovered from his first bogey of the day on the 13th to birdie the 16th before two poor shots on the 18th gave him a double-bogey. But he managed to keep the ball up for par on the last, and this was enough to claim a second consecutive top-flight win in a major.'' See also: [Canizares wins French Open]"

280,2,"The photos show a massive cloud of smoke and ash rising from Chile’s Cordon Caulle chain of volcanoes. Volcanic activity continues today with the possibility that a new eruption could occur.
	The pictures were taken in June by Argentine photographer Francisco Negroni, one of the best-known landscape photographers in the world. The Cordón Caulle volcanic chain stretches over 500 miles from the coastal town of Punta Arenas at the foot of the continent to Santiago, at the foot of the Andes.
	Mr Negroni told the Telegraph: “The plume of smoke and ash was immense, and when it started raining ash you could see the dust falling on the houses in Chile.”
	Mr Negroni, who has travelled the world taking photographs for over 30 years, has been living in Argentina for the past 20 years. His photos are on display at a centre in Buenos Aires dedicated to his work.

280,3,"Volcanic Lightning
On 20 June 2011, Volcanó Caulle, a dormant stratovolcano located at the foot of the Andes, Chile, erupted for the first time in 4,000 years. The eruption was witnessed by tens of thousands of local residents, scientists and tourists in the area.

The following pictures are from the eruption. Note the amount of ash left behind after the eruption, and the way the clouds rise into the atmosphere, and the way that the lightning strikes are reflected in them. We can see both on the right and left of the pictures, and we can see one of the lightning strikes reflected in the cloud.

Note: The following pictures are made before the eruptions. So, these are not the latest pictures of the eruption.

The lightning seems to be produced from the lava flow itself instead of at the top, as in a traditional lightning strike. The lava flows from the top of the volcano, from the surface and flows down. So, if the lava is creating enough heat to create lightning (as it would produce), then the lightning strikes will likely also be coming from the lava. Thus, lightning and lava look like they're in the same place, but are located a few kilometers"

A short, sharp rain made the pitch sticky as the teams came out for the third quarter. The green half of the pitch became congested as the ball remained in long range shooting situations.
Davy Fitzgerald brought on Kevin McKee for Mark Tumilty in the third quarter to give Ireland greater midfield control. Ireland scored the go ahead goal in the first minute of the fourth quarter and although they had possession for only 6% of the period, they worked several good opportunities that went begging.
Pakistan earned a late penalty corner which they wasted. With 11 seconds left, and the referee signaling a short corner, the Pakistan skipper rushed in from full-back and fired an effort that was well saved by Harte.

Afghanistan's first female rapper has proved that she has little interest in the rules of hip-hop. She may be its first female rapper, but Sosan Firooz defies all norms that define the genre. In her music, she raps about the repression of women in Afghanistan, her hopes for peace in her home country and the hardships of life for ordinary Afghans, all with her father as her only accompaniment. Though this might appear controversial, Firooz has actually found support from other Afghan artists, and is determined not to let anything stop her from speaking her mind.

I work at an LWD company which supports BP (we do some of the subsurface stuff for the Macondo well). We are not running anything on the platform just yet, but it's likely that they are shutting down operations on the rig.
It's a pity, since that rig is great for training and getting people used to running rigs before they move over to land-based drilling rigs, which cost a fortune and are very boring to work on.
The rig itself is a semi-submersible, which means it sits on an extremely long (4km) steel barge. Since the Macondo well is around 7-9 miles under the sea (give or take a few thousand feet) it isn't safe to work in that kind of environment with a rig on a barge. On the other hand if you didn't have one this would be a great platform for training.
A rig, as a crude term it sounds a little better than what it actually is --- a drilling platform on the sea floor --- sits at a height of around 200-300 feet, which is very high in comparison to what you would find in the ocean. A drilling platform floats, and is basically just a massive oil rig with a"

The 26-year-old managed hundreds of client accounts at a London branch where clients tend to be wealthy. Prosecutors say the fraud was masterminded by Khan's friend Farah Mahmood, 26. Khan, who'd previously had previous convictions for dishonesty, started at Barclays in September 2009. Barclays managers were only supposed to go and talk to clients in person. But Khan used a colleague's identification to get into the account in this instance. Khan swiped £10,000 from the account of a customer described as 'particularly old and vulnerable' before he was caught. Prosecutors say Khan lied on his CV in order to have this job. He had previously worked for a mobile phone company and had no banking experience. Khan said he was in contact with his account all the time.

What Jose Mourinho is likely to say:
``` If I could choose to take my team somewhere in Europe, it would be to the States, or maybe even China.  ```
“I would be delighted to coach this incredible Chelsea team in Premier League. Every player plays in a great team and plays with ambition to win. All of them understand what winning the title means – it is about pride and that passion is amazing. Now the challenge is to have a consistent season that will see us winning trophies and fighting for the title during the entire season. It is our objective and we will try everything to achieve it.”
“For me, being a coach in England is the most beautiful thing. From the top league in the world, the Champions League is a great tournament to play and Chelsea have qualified in the past, so we have to respect the competition and the level of the clubs we are going to meet now that we played Champions League.

No. It has to be by measure, it has to be perfect,’ Mourinho told Sports Illustrated. ‘So the personal relationship with the players is something very very important.

68415,1,"Thierry Henry should not play unless Arsenal's strikers are in form. So why hasn't he been let go yet? He is one of their best players in every aspect and the fact that he is the club's record goalscorer gives him such a major influence in the way we play. Henry is probably the best in the world right now and at 34 he should not be forced to sit on the bench. If anyone thinks he will ever walk back into our line up he is very very wrong. Wenger will use him at the right time and if we need him so desperately the answer is simple; bring him on. All other arguments against him are just excuses and they are all nonsense.
      The reason he is still at Arsenal at 34 is simple. He is one of their highest earners. Arsenal have no choice at the moment, because there are no ready-made replacements. But, it's still time to end the nightmare that is Thierry Henry.

And we'd rather not have to ban people or have an endless flurry of ""debate me and I'll ban you"" posts. It's been getting pretty bad recently. If people do get personal in a discussion, they should expect to be banned, and if they think they are banned they should get in touch and get it sorted so we can unban them.

75288,1,"Summary: The Brazilians and the Germans have both been excellent defensively in this tournament, which does not bode well for their semi-final clashes. If there's any one thing that could be said to be the main difference between the two sides it is how Brazil have gone about their business defensively, whereas Germany's form has been all about the art of attacking football. But with the game played for the first time in a half-season (a few days ahead of schedule) and a match taking place two days after a week - as opposed to a month - will that mean that the players are fatigued and that it gives Brazil the edge? Or will the players have managed to manage their time off more efficiently and will that give Germany the advantage? We shall have to wait and see. But one thing's for sure: this is definitely going to be an entertaining and hopefully a hard-working tie.''

23775,2,"In 1986, the space shuttle Challenger blasted off for the first space station flyby. Challenger took off from the Kennedy Space Center on its 9th mission, carrying 7 astronauts including an 11-year-old girl who would become one of the youngest to fly in space. Two minutes and 41 seconds into the flight, the shuttle broke apart, killing its crew. The official reason for the disintegration is ''the disintegration of Challenger's thermal protection system"" due to an ''impending"" reentering object, which damaged the fuel tank and caused a breach of the fuel tank.[1] The crash also damaged a number of scientific instruments, and severely damaged or destroyed the gyroscopic stabilizers, roll and pitch control lines, and the main propulsion systems. It caused extensive damage to Mission Control and many of its telemetry systems. In the wake of the Challenger disaster, NASA established the Program Office Safety Review Board and the Independent Safety Review Board. In 1991, a NASA review recommended the replacement of the shuttle's composite structure- a move that would allow the shuttle to safely carry 8 astronauts and a larger payload into orbit.

The lyrics are familiar from a thousand nativity plays and Christmas carol services. But what do the words to Away In a Manger mean exactly? That is the question pondered by television historian Mary Beard after she attended this year's annual carol service at King's College, Cambridge. Confusion: Mary Beard, a professor in classics at Cambridge, wrote about the 'weird' Away In a Manger lyrics in a newspaper column. The historian, a professor in classics at Cambridge University, wrote about how she was struck by the phrase 'no crib for a bed' as she perused the lyrics printed in her order of service. Writing in her column in the Times Literary Supplement, Professor Beard said of the printed lyrics: 'It did make you reflect on what made a good carol, what was the right blend of sentimentality and jolliness. 'It also made you reflect on how weird some of the words were (what actually does ""no crib for a bed"" mean?),' she added. Carols: The historian attended this year's King"
5312,3,"The exact wording of the lyrics from Away in a Manger.

As an alternative, a brief history of the lyrics of the carol away in a manger to Jesus Christ is listed below.

From Away in a Manger in the New Testament Bible

Manger

A manger is a feeding trough, a crib, or an isolated area for feeding livestock. This was a practice that was widespread until comparatively recently.  It is a trough built with three sides, for animals to rest in and eat food from.  The trough can be round or square, and made from a variety of materials. Although the troughs were originally made of wood, the material for these can vary greatly.  They also can include rocks and branches to improve traction and to make footing more comfortable for the animals.  The troughs were built so close together that animals could not enter each other's troughs.  In addition, these smaller pens could be kept within one big space to keep the animals moving and to improve the smell in the barn.  The animals rested in the mangers at night and the mangers were cleaned out and refilled daily. The Romans tended to use the term for the round, trough-shaped containers."
5312,4,"This essay offers reasons for abandoning the search for life on other planets in favour of focusing more seriously on human flourishing, including the potential for self-determination. I begin by drawing on John Bellamy Foster's call for ""an Earth-centred politics"" that would ensure that the earth--and everyone on it--could flourish. I then explore the meaning of the ""good life"" (as distinct from ""good job"" and ""good health"") that I believe is an essential part of any life that is worth living. (...) ```

There is a ``substance'' paragraph before the ``words'' (and underlined/highlighted), but the paragraph that follows provides neither a URL nor lists. Perhaps it is the author's intention to infer URLs (and presumably lists) from other facts or context of the paragraph but not at the sentence's point.

This sentence has many problems, the first of which is that it lacks any sense of reality, for a human being does not live for more than a few decades in what is essentially a prison, which is the case for all condemned murderers. The second problem is that it suggests or at least allows the reader to infer that the crime(s) are recent, while the article reports of the defendant's age, and the date of sentencing is several decades ago, so why is Mr. Ranta leaving the jail today? Is there some conspiracy or a hidden agenda to suggest that someone should commit a crime and spend a long time in jail to get out?

Iraqi Parliament elects Sunni Jabouri Speaker
By Staff Sgt. Daniel M. Davis U.S. Air Force

IRAQ CITY, Iraq (AFNS) -- Iraqi legislators elected a Sunni politician as Parliament speaker Tuesday, finally taking a step to form a new government after two weeks of deadlock while the country faces a powerful Islamist militant insurgency. Lawmakers elected Salim al-Jabouri, the head of a Sunni coalition, as speaker of Iraq's Council of Representatives. The Iraqi Constitution mandates that the job go to a Sunni Muslim. The body also elected two deputy speakers.

Al-Jabouri announced that lawmakers are accepting nominations for president, saying that there are three days to nominate and then the body will reconvene.

It is hard to believe that this happened. I had the privilege to work with retired police officers all the time, serving the city in the same capacity as those mentioned in the article. There was one particular police officer I really looked up to and in no way is he guilty for what he is accused to have done. This is a violation of their sworn duty and duty to protect and serve. And to suggest that they could be blackmailed in their actions is another violation of a persons privacy. Police work is serious business and should be approached by those with the proper standards. It is hard to believe that anyone would think about trying to compromise our officers, but the consequences for anyone in that position of enforcing the law would be disastrous. And a victim would not have recourse for any further wrongdoing. Law enforcement is a tough job and I have a hard time believing that a senior officer would attempt such an action. It is very upsetting to have a public figure commit this type of crime. It damages the public view of law enforcement and it brings dishonor to the position of a police officer.

58232,3,"By. Associated Press. SAN JOSE, Calif. -- President Barack Obama on Friday came to a Wal-Mart store in Silicon Valley to praise new steps by businesses and communities to deploy solar energy, but critics blasted the giant retailer for paying low wages and selling goods at prices that can be difficult for low-income people and families to afford. In a Rose Garden appearance, Obama unveiled his own executive actions aimed at increasing efficiency with a goal of reducing U.S. reliance on foreign-generated energy.

''The commitments the president's announcing today prove that there are cost-effective ways to tackle climate change and. create jobs at the same time,'' Obama said at a sprawling Wal-Mart store in Mountain View.

This year’s Grand National attracted the largest field, the biggest attendance and the highest stakes in the race’s history.

The filly had been the second favourite, but was backed to 6-1 as the favourite, the winner One For Arthur, was not expected to be much race. Atop every poll, the National was, however, the event that was most hotly discussed. The main line of argument was that while the race has lost its luster in recent years, there was no denying that what happened yesterday was, if not a shock, certainly an upset – and that is what counts. So we do have a winner – at 66-1. The National is such a large fixture that it takes weeks for the betting to settle, but even with that it was hard not to be shocked by the final total of the betting: the biggest in the race’s history.

The cause of death remains unknown, but Robinson had recently been seen at the Hudson Lounge with friends like Dr. Oz, who were in New York for the NFL Football 2014 season.

It appears as though Robinson may have been attending the NFL playoff game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs - which ultimately went down in flames for the Kansas City team.

Robinson was a familiar face on TV, having served for two seasons on Drink Up With Darryl Robinson on the Food Network, which ran from February 2009 to January 2010.

He made multiple live appearances and was credited by the network as having 'raised the bar on bartending.'

41658,1,"The author of a new book on America's role in the “Arab Spring” has made a direct appeal to US president Obama to end America's intervention in Syria. Stephen Zunes, at the University of San Francisco, is critical of US foreign policy in the region. He is concerned that an American bombing campaign of Syria would lead to more instability and bloodshed in the region.

The Obama administration is likely to continue its policy of “strategic patience” and continue to support the opposition by providing the anti-Assad forces with training and materiel, such as ammunition and small arms to fight the Assad’s rule. The US should avoid military intervention at this stage. By refusing to intervene in Syria, the US would be supporting the Syrian government which is battling insurgents from a wide-range of Islamist radicals, Al-Qaeda affiliated groups, as well as other armed groups. It would also be avoiding a potential regional conflagration. The US has been taking a more careful approach in dealing with Syria. The Obama administration has been wary of becoming the central figure in the Syrian crisis, or in embroiling itself militarily in a sectarian conflict, especially when its efforts to help overthrow the Gaddafi regime in Libya backfired badly. The administration believes that the"

By Matt Apuzzo and Michael S. Schmidt

In the final moments of a battle, a sniper fires through a glass home, aiming at soldiers in the house across the street. The sniper doesn't know exactly where the soldiers are. The bullet glances off a surface as it travels and ricochets off of something on the other side of the door. The ricochet kills the soldier and wounds four others.

Now imagine something like that happening here.

Syria is often compared to Afghanistan, where a sniper struck the head of a 4-day-old infant in April, killing the boy, a doctor tells The Times.

Sniper shootings in Syria are common and violent incidents are rarely investigated or identified. But in the case of Rena Al-Khadra, a 9-year-old girl shot in the face, an incident that happened in August 2011 is extraordinary because the girl, who was wounded from shrapnel, pulled through, thanks to luck and an extraordinary hospital staff and was reunited with her family shortly before Christmas.

Rena, the daughter of Majda and Yasser Al-Khadra, was playing on her lounge floor, in her mother's lap,"

As the highway network expanded more and more, lanes were removed from busy motorways.... The problem with removing lanes from busy motorways is it left motorways very difficult to police.""

The main problem is that when there are so many lanes, the enforcement is a lot easier, because there's a higher probability that there will be a car in the wrong lane when the cop is patrolling.

The council is set to refund £1.1m in fines to 2,500 drivers for using bus lanes in error.
It is believed more than a dozen fines have been issued incorrectly since 6 July, when a new system of fixed cameras was introduced.
Drivers who have been incorrectly issued with tickets, when they have committed no highway offense, will receive a letter.
Council leader Nick Forbes said: ""I feel a total moral failure on this one. This is the second time in three years that we have mucked up this important new system. I am determined that this doesn't happen again.""
In September 2012, about 2,000 fines were wrongly handed out
About 30,000 drivers in the borough are understood to have received letters since January this year
Under the scheme drivers can expect a letter from a bailiffs service telling them to check their e-mail accounts in the next seven days
The borough's £20m scheme is funded by fines on drivers illegally using the lanes

The state issued tornado warnings for the area for the weekend, but this did not stop some adventurous photographers from capturing the event.

Supercells are known to create large hailstones, damaging winds, and tornadoes, and can last for hours if conditions permit.

```The Death of Joseph Wood

By Editorial Writers

January 27, 2010

The death penalty in the United States is in decline. With just five states — California, Texas, Maryland, Missouri and South Carolina — accounting for more than three-quarters of all executions since the Supreme Court reinstated it in 1976, the death march is slow and inexorable.

But the numbers mask a growing and dangerous trend. Last year, 18 states and the District of Columbia either abolished the death penalty altogether or imposed moratoriums on executions. The next few months could be critical. Governors in California and New Jersey are scheduled to decide soon on whether to abolish the death penalty for good. Meanwhile, in Georgia, Louisiana, N.J., Nevada, Ohio and Arkansas, governors are waiting to see what a federal judge rules before deciding what to do with their capital cases. And in Colorado, the voters will decide in November whether to keep the death penalty in place.''`

The main point of the editorial is this:  ""The Death Sentence in the US Is Declining and the Death Penalty is In Existence, It's Just Not in Use Anymore for Good Reason.""  They argue that capital punishment"

57489,2,Arizona executed Death Row prisoner Joseph Wood this week. Officials said Wood appeared to be in no pain and snoring; although witnesses said he did gasp for breath and snore. He was executed after two hours of agony. `''-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
57489,3,"The background is, the U.S. Supreme Court recently struck down a Virginia law prohibiting execution of offenders under 18. It is claimed that any execution carried out on a juvenile that the family doesn't support or that is against the family's religious beliefs would be against the will of the majority of the family. This may or may not be a problem for any particular inmate; it is the idea of the general idea that is the problem.  The implications may or may not result in some difficulties as this may create questions as to whether family or beliefs play any role at all with regards to a sentence. It may even create questions concerning the possibility of the right to life in the first place. It appears that even if these concepts are not applied to individual cases it is not clear as to how they would not be applied to a society wide basis. It may even bring into question whether society may place any value on the life of a child and its claim to the right to life.

57489,4,"Arizona spent two hours killing death row inmate Joseph Wood this week, an unusually long time for an execution. Wood's death has reopened the dispute about capital punishment and lethal injection. Lethal injection is used in all 32 states that have the death penalty. Some witnesses said Wood was gasping for breath and seemed to be in pain. Others said he was simply snoring. The state of Arizona said Wood didn't suffer. Either way, there are renewed concerns that executions, which are supposed to be quick and painless, are neither. Typically executions are performed using three drugs in stages. The first drug is an anesthetic. The second drug is called a paralytic and the third drug is supposed to stop the heart. For years, executioners used a drug called sodium thiopental as the first drug, the anesthetic, until the only U.S. producer of the drug stopped making it. Then the United States turned to European manufacturers, but they refused to sell the drug for use in executions. Since sodium thiopental was taken off the market for executions, states have turned to a drug called midazolam for the anesthetic. But experts believe there have been problems with the drug in at least three executions. The problems described by witnesses included gasping, sn"

69472,2,"Pinning as a Social Network
The “pinning” of content by users as a form of social networking has been an important part of the growing popularity of Pinterest. Not only are users sharing pictures and ideas but they are sharing ideas of their friends. This is more of a social network and less of a traditional bulletin board system. In order to create a true bulletin board system the users would have to be able to add, delete and moderate new boards on a more frequent basis. This would make it more like a classic bulletin board system and less of an ongoing social network. The ability to add, delete and moderate ideas would also create a more positive environment so people would not be put off by seeing some negative comments. The social aspect of Pinterest is one that will be an important draw for new users. As the site continues to grow and become more common it is hoped that there will be a positive social atmosphere around the site. Because of its popularity and the ease of use of the design of the site it is very likely that the site will continue to experience a growth rate for months to come. The following sections will demonstrate how the design of Pinterest can enhance its potential as a social networking tool."

Blanco was found dying on the ground outside a butchers shop in the city of Medellin before being rushed to hospital. She reportedly had more than $25million (£16million) in cash in her wallet. The three-time murderer was being hunted by police last night after ordering a hit on a businesswoman who allegedly blackmailed her. Blanco reportedly fled the US in 1977 after being charged with the murders of a nightclub promoter and a gang-leader's daughter in Florida. The 'Godmother of Cocaine'was jailed for 20 years in the US for three murders in the early 80s - but was finally deported in 2004. She had been living quietly in her native Columbia, often playing guitar at parties and giving interviews. Today her death has shocked the Colombian city of where she had lived in for many years. It is not known why the 70-year-old was shot yesterday, on a day when Colombians celebrate independence in full pomp. Police have launched an investigation into the killing.

Blanco, a Colombian national and former accountant, ran the Blanco Organization, a large-scale drug ring in Miami. In the 1980s and 1990s, Blanco’s crew shipped tons of cocaine into the U.S. from Colombia. The cocaine was then smuggled through South Florida and delivered to the East Coast in tractor trailers. The cocaine was then packaged and distributed throughout the country. In the mid-1980s, Blanco’s crew expanded its operations by launching the “Miami Way.” This involved smuggling drugs into and out of other U.S. cities. In 1985, the FBI began to suspect Blanco’s operation. During a sting operation, the Bureau was able to buy 20 pounds of cocaine directly from the Blanco Organization. In 1986, a federal judge sentenced Blanco to a 20-year jail sentence. While incarcerated, she launched a series of political attacks on Colombian President Raul Reyes. After being released, Blanco was deported back to the country, where she was placed under house arrest. As a"

Dr. Eric Lofgren, Chief of Emergency Medicine in Salt Lake City, UT says that his cardiac arrest patients who are given cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) do not fare well compared with those who have CPR that does not stimulate respiration. ""The bottom line is a patient that has CPR is not surviving any worse than without CPR, but the ones that do not give oxygen to the brain are surviving a lot worse,""  he said. And that applies even to patients who were unconscious and in cardiac arrest in a hospital emergency room.

A recent study demonstrated that patients who were not given a respirator in the emergency department and subsequently died would have a survival time of 19 days versus those who received a respiratory ventilator.

Studies show that patients who do not receive ventilation"

By Dan Zak, ABC news staff
NEW YORK (AP) -- After 11 minutes of being clinically dead, a Long Island triathlete is talking about his amazing recovery.
Chris LaPak says the day he almost died, he was ready to die.
""It was like looking into my own future,"" said LaPak. ""I don't think I was doing the most wise thing in the world. I don't think I was really thinking.""
LaPak suffered a heart attack and stroke in the Hudson River last August at what he calls ""the most important day in my life.""
He almost drowned in the frigid water. It took rescuers an hour and a half to get him out.
LaPak was out of action for six months. He thought he was going to die.

On August 3, he was swimming in the Hudson River when he developed a cardiac arrest and stopped breathing.

4. But Woke Up Without Brain Damage

Now, it's my job to summarize my findings and then get down to the details about LaPak's ""recovery"" and the reason why he did not die. First, I want to make clear that a ""clinical death"" is different from a brain death or a heart death. If a person's heart stops, their life is in danger and the individual has less than two minutes. If the heart stops, that person's blood is no longer pumping and that person's brain oxygen levels fall. If the heart stops, the body switches to a phase of ""permanent unconsciousness"" or ""imminent death"". The brain cannot breathe or metabolize sugar and oxygen. The heart remains pumping, but the body is no longer providing that oxygenated blood to the brain. So what distinguishes between ""clinical death"" and the other two?"

A mother is determined that no one else will have to

too many energy drinks.

Shani Clarke told Mumbrella that her son was a

lunch break meal.

""I could see when he got a bit of money from his work to go out and have a few drinks at a bar, that's normally where he went.""

Ms Clarke said she didn't realise her son was buying energy drinks until a few weeks before he died.

76390,0,"People are waiting to see, and are not going to be rushing into these new pensions,'' a spokeswoman from the Association of British Insurers [ABI] was quoted as saying by the Sunday Times.

I believe most comments here are misunderstanding this. They are not trying to discourage people from reading this article. But rather they are trying to discourage people from immediately rushing to use the new pensions.
I personally think the ABI's advice was wrong here and is going to make a few people quite unhappy.

Here is a link to a BBC news story on Hargreaves Lansdown's website. It shows that they were the source of this article.

I was surprised that the ABI was behind it. They've been the party that's been most vocally critical of the implementation as a whole (""The government's guidance service has also got off to a quiet start.""). It makes sense that they'd want to keep the media talking about the reforms, they want the reforms to fail, but they're usually good at that.

My first reaction was to check the company's website. The story is on their front page! A quick check of the web cache shows that it was there 2 minutes ago, but now it isn't."
76390,1,"I'm not getting a lot of detail other than that the initial reaction was ''good'', and the first week of the 'new' system may be showing a lack of action. In a sense this is a good thing. People in financial trouble should not rush into decisions to help them get out of it until they can be certain that what they are doing is the best possible solution. They are in the unfortunate position of being unable to defer any decisions for as long as they want, and being able to talk to someone with experience of these problems is a big benefit. One of the reasons for this, though, is that the problem they have is relatively simple to understand. The people who need to contact someone the most, with the biggest, most complex pension plans, probably do not have the first clue about how the pension system has worked for the last quarter of a century.

The pension rules are confusing. They have been for decades and will remain so for years to come. It is not surprising that people want to talk to someone to get clear advice.
Some people are obviously too poor to afford the fees involved.
I am one of these people. I find the pension rules impenetrable and can't really see how to approach retirement"
76390,2,"Examining the Government's 'help' for cash-strapped pensioners

After many weeks of bad publicity about cuts to Winter Fuel Allowance and a lack of pension increases, the Government set itself a clear challenge to help people with rising fuel and inflation prices.

Many were quick to condemn David Cameron's ''Help to Save'', under which most people would be expected to pay a small amount of money upfront to access their pension savings.

Today Chancellor George Osborne said this would be a way of helping the most vulnerable.
He said: ''The challenge we face is to reach those pensioners who will need further support because of these energy price rises and other pressures.

''That's why we are taking action to help pensioners who may be struggling to manage their household costs.''

But what exactly is the ''help'' on offer?

The Chancellor's ''Help to Save'' plan could mean that from 2015 up to 7 million existing pension accounts would be brought out of the defined contribution (DC) tax system.

Up to now the only people who could take their money out of a pension were members of defined benefit (DB) schemes, under which the employer or the Government (through a State Pension)"
76390,3,"The Daily Telegraph article seems to be the basis of that link. But I think they missed out quite a few aspects of the story.
It is all a bit vague what type of pension and how it works. Presumably it is a defined benefit scheme, but can you draw it all in less than 30 years, are you guaranteed an income for life or just some years. We have seen what happens when pensions are sold and the problems are not limited to those affected in work. There are a lot of pension schemes people are not aware of.

I have seen this issue before. Many companies have pensions schemes. They usually are good and most people are pretty happy with them. If you're an employee then you usually get all the money paid in plus a guaranteed income till you die (and in some cases with inflation and rising costs it can rise quite substantially).
Then there are people who don't earn enough to pay in but still have to contribute. This is where the problem lies!
I worked in a building society as a part-time clerk/banker. Those people could contribute as little as £2. They would be hit with 5% tax. I could get £2.70 for every £100 of my salary paid in."

This included the Whitehall car park and a shared car park near the airport with 1 mile of underground passages, and in some instances the customers' cars had been taken away completely, leaving them to find their way to a safe place to park their car. When Mr Allwright's team checked the cars themselves, they said they could not find their car anywhere and, when they rang the company, they said the car was on site. The programme aired on BBC1 on Tuesday, 26 May 2001.

* When you hire a car : Find out what sort of cars the company has. Do they offer cars with air-conditioning/heating that works or not? Did they offer you some insurance like breakdown/breakdown protection, excess insurance or theft insurance included in the price? Where do you park? Find out what is the fee for the first night, the following days, then compare it against cheaper offers: at short-term car hire offices, in privately-owned car parks, or in the airport car park (including Gold Parking).

In a paper published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, scientists from the University of Sheffield say they have discovered some skulls dated as much as 70 years older than previously thought.
The ossuary was built in the mid 12th Century. The bones found date to the 13th through 19th centuries. The oldest were laid to rest just weeks before the First World War, the scientists found.
The researchers were led by Paula Reimer. She said there was a lot of confusion about the remains. ""In many cases, people were making assumptions about the ossuary as a medieval thing,"" she said.
She added: ""People were assuming that nobody in Rothwell had a big brain. We are very surprised about the dates, and that has led to some good research.""
The research found that some of the bones had suffered decay or animal disturbance before being deposited in the crypt.

The prime minister said the House of Commons vote was a ""victory"" for the Conservatives.
But he insisted his government was not going to change its stance on the euro, after some suggested another vote would be held.
The government's key economic advisor - the Chancellor George Osborne - indicated he was unlikely to change direction.
Mr Cameron said MPs had backed a ""more positive attitude"" about Europe and said the government would ""reflect"" on the result.
He also said that, despite a series of polls suggesting otherwise, voters in Britain still supported his position on EU membership.
But Mr Cameron's main achievement on Wednesday was winning over several Tory MPs who had previously voted against a referendum.

MPs pass EU referendum motion
In a landmark vote on the EU, the UK Parliament has overwhelmingly backed an effort to trigger a people's vote to keep Britain inside the 28-member bloc.
The motion, sponsored by two independent peers, was approved by 478 to 111 votes, with all the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP, the Plaid Cymru and the DUP supporting it.
There were 81 Tory MPs who defied the government whip.
The government has ruled out a referendum on membership of the EU.
It says the issue is settled in favour of the UK staying in, but is being kept as a ""policy option"" as it tries to overhaul the country's relationship with Brussels.
David Cameron told the prime ministers of five other remaining countries that they needed to offer Britain a deal to allow the country to be part of reforms of the EU.
The prime minister has said the UK will stay in whatever deal is offered, but the other four governments said that they had not agreed to renegotiate Britain's terms of EU membership.

I'm seeing 'the Conservatives have been defeated in another vote' headline and 'UK parliament to vote on second reading of bill authorising powers to hold a referendum on United Kingdom's membership of the European Union'.
What is the significance of the first and second readings in parliamentary procedure? If not all MPs vote against the bill in their second reading, does that mean we are on our way to a referendum? If the government is still on side, why then are they opposed to the second reading?

It will still be defeated in the House of Lords. And the government is opposed to the idea of a second referendum.

It would appear the government has won this argument with their backbenchers."

“I’m not going to jump out and say the prime minister should give up, I do think it would be far better if we were in control of our own future.”

Australia poised to raise terror threat level to high

 The Australian Associated Press, AUGUST 31 2014, 12:33AM.

Australia on Thursday was poised to raise its national terror threat level to its highest level in more than 11 years, with the threat believed to be from extremist Muslims who have seen their passports blocked by spy agencies.

The government was considering changing the terror threat level it last raised in April 2001, which was later dropped, to the second-level of high, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin told reporters.

""It is now very high. We need to get this decision right,"" Colvin said in Brisbane.

""At the moment, there has been a shift in threat level from what we were seeing earlier in the year.

""That is, a shift from what's been predominantly, what we've seen in the past, of people from outside Australia. Now we're seeing a shift to an increased level of actual terrorist activity from inside Australia, and the threat level has been escalated as a result of that.""

He said the decision is still open, but given the change in threat level, the next step is ""to determine whether what we have in place currently will"

Article: I usually patiently explain that if I knew what was in the chancellor's red box, I probably wouldn't have to work for a living. But there are a few areas where we have a good idea of what Philip Hammond is planning.
Some Budget changes have already been announced. It's always helpful to remember this when MPs start cheering re-announced tax cuts or fuel duty freezes.
In the new financial year that begins on April 6, the amount you can earn before paying income tax will rise from £10,600 to £11,500. The higher rate threshold will rise from £43,000 to £45,000.
For savers, the annual ISA limit rises from £15,240 to £20,000. Corporation tax will be cut from 20% to 19%. Insurance premium tax will rise from 10% to 12% in June.
Petrol duty is frozen until April 2018.
The Treasury has already trailed several announcements that will mean higher spending on technical education and (some) schools in England. The Welsh Government will get a share of increases in comparable spending in England, to spend as it chooses. If the chancellor announces extra cash for social care in England, the same rule"
2854,1,"```

""There is speculation that the Chancellor will announce an extension of the Help to Buy scheme which gives loans of up to 20% of the value of the property, subject to a minimum contribution of 3%.
The scheme was launched in October 2013 to provide housing for young people and first time home movers and ended in September 2015.
The property must be the owner's main residence and the loan repayment cannot be higher than four times an individual's income (including any benefits they receive).""

As the budget comes just two days before the G7 summit and Brexit negotiations begin, there could be a temptation for the Chancellor to look back to the election and try to create fiscal firepower to support future growth. This would, however, be a mistake, even though his current fiscal surplus is very strong compared with his previous forecasts at the start of Philip Hammond's term in office.

The budget will also be the final statement for George Osborne (unfortunately only in a caretaker capacity as he will be out of his post by the summer). The Chancellor is aware that the Chancellor has been under pressure, and this budget will be an opportunity to provide economic stability for the next few years while the UK works out a new relationship with the EU as it leaves on"

Some UK firms have been hit badly by the fall in sterling since the Brexit vote. Their exports are mainly to the EU so the higher costs are reflected in their selling price, which has already hurt sales to UK customers.
Firms are complaining about rising wages, too. This is a big change from a few years ago when real wages were falling. The Resolution Foundation forecasts that the typical worker will have £800 extra to spend on everything from petrol to new shoes by 2019.
So who loses out now? And who may be helped by higher wages?
One change will make it much cheaper for firms to make and sell lots of items to UK consumers, including some consumer durables.

These women, known as ""Pearl Queens"", have since become folk legends with many tales of great bravery and daring associated with them. They were, however, also victims of the cruel and exploitative practice of Japanese pearl merchants.

The Qing Dynasty was the era when China was at its most prosperous, and its ruling family was regarded across the Chinese world as a symbol of good governance and prosperity. The Chinese Emperor had three wives known as the Pearls of Heaven (Pu-kuo-si). After his tragic death in 1796 many of the women were widowed, and became the centre of China's highest society.

The analysis suggests that the cost of buying a home is rising rapidly, fuelled by a decline in the number of first-time buyers.
However, it suggests that the crisis has been worsened by policies since the financial crisis that restrict the availability of low-cost loans and home ownership to wealthier households.
Under current regulations those wanting to buy a first home after saving for five years must find a deposit of nearly 18% of the value of the property.
Using this standard, the average buyer would need to save about £64,800 over the next five years.
This is an improvement on PwC estimates for a house price rise of 3% a year, which the firm says is an unrealistic estimate. Â
The firm says first-time buyers typically need to find a deposit of 18% to secure a mortgage and its analysis suggests this is on the way to becoming the new norm.

Once for the privileged few, flying domestically within China has boomed. Civil Aviation Administration of China figures suggest that in 1982 there were fewer than four million air passenger journeys within the country. By 2016, that number had reached 487 million.
AirAsia said that as well as running the airline, it would invest in aviation infrastructure and set up an academy to train pilots, crew and engineers.
There would also be new facilities to service and maintain aircraft in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province.
AirAsia already has a presence in China, flying to 15 destinations there, making it the country's largest foreign budget airline.

''A pair of French thieves posing as police officers stole £173,000 in cash from a Saudi businessman minutes after he had landed in Paris. The robbers stopped him at gunpoint on a busy motorway at around 11am but he escaped unharmed, police sources said. The robbery is believed to be an isolated incident and is being investigated. The diplomat had landed only minutes earlier at Le Bourget airport close to Paris. 'We did not know who they were or if they were working on a tip off or simply got lucky,'' said a French police spokesman. Theft is the latest in a string of thefts on wealthy visitors to Paris. A group of 23 Chinese tourists were robbed in a restaurant also nearby Le Bourget soon after arriving in France back in March. They were attacked by three armed men who stole their passports and around 7,500 Euros in cash. Jena-Frangois"

Two men posing as French law enforcement officials robbed a taxi driver at gunpoint of about $172,000, the latest in a series of brazen thefts of jewelry and cash at hotels and restaurants frequented by wealthy foreigners. The taxi driver, who was driving the Saudi diplomat late last month, was held up at 10 p.m. on Dec. 26 on a major highway near Paris, where he was robbed of the cash and the car. The men are believed to have also fled in his Toyota, which had blue lights indicating that it contained law enforcement officers.

The Saudi diplomat was returning to Paris from an airport in Lyon, where he had arrived minutes earlier in a private plane.

The robbery appears yet another one in a series of brazen thefts of jewelry and cash at hotels and restaurants frequented by wealthy foreigners.

He said: ""If the European Union is spending billions getting people out of poverty... in these countries it doesn't work. It is as simple as that.""

“What we are going to do is bring this back to Europe and say that to the tune of 1 billion pounds which goes to these African countries does not work. That money is going into some strange place where it is being squandered.”

Mr Bloom then went on to say all the aid money was spent on ‘Ray-Ban sunglasses, apartments in Paris, Ferraris and all the rest of it’.

The BBC is to re-advertise for the job of a representative for Wales on the new, BBC Board.
It has emerged that the BBC's governing body, the BBC Trust, had appointed a preferred candidate to represent Wales on the new board, but the job advert appears to have now been pulled following a disagreement between the BBC Trust and the Welsh Assembly Government.
Last week the Department for Culture, Media and Sport confirmed the four new board members of the BBC, one for England and one for each of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
While the role of board representative for Wales was one of the four vacancies not filled, the Welsh Government, rather than the BBC Trust, has responsibility for appointing someone to that vacancy.
However, the Welsh Assembly Government has been in dispute with the BBC Trust over how the board member for Wales should be appointed in recent weeks.
Both sides seem to be at loggerheads at the moment, so it is not known how long it will take the BBC Trust to re-advertise for a role for a board member for Wales.

Background
Dr Bell served on the BBC Board for four years from 2003 to 2007 and was the only woman representing Wales during that period.
Prior to this, she held a number of senior roles in British Gas, and is a Trustee of the National Museum of Wales as well as a member of Cardiff University's Council.

Controversy

Vetoing a preferred candidate
The appointment for board member for Wales was at the centre of a storm last week, with politicians and BBC insiders claiming they were unaware the secretary of state had made any decision.
It was claimed Dr Bell's appointment was being blocked by one of Chancellor George Osborne's aides, Andrew MacGregor who heads up his Welsh Office division, who had reservations about her background in business and her links to the Conservative Party. The BBC also believed it was unlikely Dr Bell would receive the endorsement of the First Minister Carwyn Jones.

-- Britain will send its ambassador to Saudi Arabia for the first time in a decade after the British government pledged to press the kingdom to release an elderly British man imprisoned on charges of having homemade wine,

The UK said it would also investigate the case of Karl Andree, a 75-year-old retired businessman who was last month sentenced to 12 lashes and 360 days in jail after he was arrested at his home and accused of making alcohol.

Mr Andree was cleared of the charges but remains in prison in the Red Sea coastal city of Jeddah, amid rumours he is suffering from poor health and that his life was at risk. His family fears he could be flogged and his daughter said his hands were bleeding.

Hughes spent two weeks in a medically induced coma before he died and his family released a statement at the time saying: ""As a family, we are devastated today.

Some state corrections officials had warned prosecutors about fraudulent paperwork involving five Florida inmates in the past two years, he said. The DOC is also searching the state's courthouses for other such alleged forgeries. Three of the inmates involved in the escape had used the fraudulent documents to try and get out of prison earlier this year.

This story is a bit bizarre.  I'm glad they caught the men though, hopefully they'll get the proper punishment.  I'm just not sure why an inmate would have any reason to try to get somebody to buy them something on a counterfeit check or use someone's cellmate's cell phone to mail things.  What kind of motive would there be to put yourself in a situation where you would have to fake your own death?  This case strikes me as bizarre.

Thanks for the note Andy. That is, of course, a very relevant and important question — and one that is probably only of historical significance.

Thanks. But it did mention the rape, not her nationality.

This is a problem that will have to be addressed one way or another. Not just in Delhi, but throughout the whole country.

Well, the problem is India will not pay enough attention to the problem (I'd argue there are a lot of other problems right now, this one getting attention only because it is international news).
And I can't see any incentive for other countries to pay attention - why would another country think there's anything that a country like India could do about it? In fact, with some exceptions the Western world seems to have forgotten women are capable of being raped themselves, and the men who do it to them aren't from the West, so they might just as well ignore the problem.

""It had to be a physician that said, did you have sexual abuse in utero,"" says Dr. Stephen J. Morse of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  ``And that's very different than saying, are you a survivor?""

The article does mention the fact that Mayor Ray Nagin of New Orleans is a Democrat, but otherwise the story doesn't make it very clear why the Republicans are the answer, other than the usual anti-government propaganda that gets churned out every election.

Agreed. And I don't think the 'cancer' analogy fits that well either. Addiction is hard to shake and some people have to go to extremes to get sober. But it's pretty much all of us, every day, making a 'bad choice,' to some degree or another. At least that's how I see it.

Seattle, July 20 -- Rescue crews discovered a 21-year-old woman who became stranded on the Snoqualmie Pass in Washington state. Rescuers found a smoke signal the woman had put up while she was lost, as she spent two days and three nights near the snowy forest.

After her rescue, the woman was said to be cold and weak as rescue teams checked her blood pressure and her vital signs at the Summitview Station above Cle Elum. She told rescue worker she'd gone for a hike on July 21 with her two dogs, but because of the heavy snow at upper elevation, they couldn't get back to their car and decided to stay put.

In that case, FIFA said he was suspended ```for life'' as the world governing body investigated the widespread allegations of corruption in its governance and finances. Mutko said he would not be involved in organising football until 2018 because of the sanctions but he has been an influential figure in Russian football, with UEFA saying he would remain deputy president. He was appointed as Vitaly Mutko, Deputy Prime Minister for Sport in the Russian government when Vladimir Putin was elected president in 2012, and was the face for the Russian Football Federation (RFF) as the country worked to win back the right to host the 2018 World Cup. He denied claims by independent investigator Richard McLaren, who said he found secret files in the Moscow State University laboratory that showed athletes were being given special treatment in order to gain the Russian national team selection. Mutko said some of the allegations from the so-called ""McLaren Report"" released in 2016 were ""made up"" after FIFA had already ruled against him.

Part of the report outlines samples taken from two women's ice hockey players that contained male DNA.
''If you have sex five days before taking a doping test, they can find male DNA in you,'' said Mutko.
''If a female athlete undergoes a drug test within five days after the act, then the test will show that she has male hormones - and yet it evokes suspicions of her using different drugs.'
Former World Anti-Doping Agency vice-president Arne Ljungqvist said DNA is ''very personal'' and ''cannot be shared via sex''.
In saying Russian athletes were unfairly treated, Mutko drew comparison with the cases of Canadian pole vault world champion Shawn Barber and French tennis player Richard Gasquet, who avoided punishment after blaming positive drugs tests for cocaine on kissing women who had ingested the banned substance.
''One [athlete] can kiss a girl who has taken a drug. A foreign [athlete] is reinstated based on this while a Russian is punished,'' Mutko told Russian publication Sport-Express.

So the officers took only enough men and supplies to get them through the night.  By morning they had sailed for Iceland where they planned to pick up supplies and help for the men left behind.

Supporters of the deal, however, say it will lower tariffs and promote growth.
Protesters in Frankfurt carried banners reading 'No TTIP, no CETA' and 'TTIP is dangerous'.
Similar demonstrations were held in Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Frankfurt, with many citing the need to keep European standards in place and fight what critics say will be privatisation of health, social and environmental services.

English pair Paxton and Skelton win pairs world indoor crown
By Jonathan Ellington, BBC Sport

Simon Paxton and Robert Skelton took the world pairs crown for the second successive year by beating Scots Paul Foster and Marshall McComb on the final day of the World Indoor Bowls Championship.

World indoor champions Paxton and Skelton lost to Paxton's partner Robert 'Bobby' Foster and Marshall McComb, the world number one pair, at last year's tournament in England.

In 2002, however, they overcame the World Number One pair - who had won the men's and women's competitions earlier in the week - in the semifinal on Saturday and then went on to win the final over their Scottish opponents from Auld Grannie and Billy.

It was the English pair's fourth victory in their last five championships and the ninth in their 10 previous visits to the world final.

""It is the first final for myself and, to win at the first attempt, you can't get better,'' said Paxton."

CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Rolf Harris, the octopus with three legs convicted of molesting four young girls in the 1970s, will appeal his conviction on grounds that some of his accusers didn't know they hadn't been sexually abused, an appeal lawyer said Tuesday.'s lawyer said her client is filing a single appeal on all the grounds to the Australian High Court, which has 15 days to accept or reject it. Her statement gave no date for the appeal.Harris was sentenced this month to five years and nine months in prison. He served two days in a Melbourne prison during his trial last month.' was convicted of 12 charges of indecently assaulting girls ages 8, 9 and 11 and a 16-year-old at London's Westminster Magistrates' court. The charges were considered unrelated by the judge and were tried separately.His appeals lawyer, Lucy Oughton, said Harris wants the High Court to review his convictions on the grounds that some of the girls didn't realize they had been molested at the time, or that they ""misunderstood the context in which events were occurring"

Australian pedophile, 84-year-old Rolf Harris, should face the first of three High Court hearings as soon as possible as the Crown Prosecution Service has until the end of January 2012 to make their case in detail. The Crown is expected to outline a dossier so comprehensive and detailed that Harris could be hauled away to jail for many, many years. In another High Court hearing - likely to be held later this year - Harris will argue that two trial judges should not have been given his name, and the details of his defence team (which was made up of David Allen Green QC, David Sherborne QC and Jonathan Rees QC). In that hearing he will also dispute the judge's decisions to dismiss some of his challenges as unreasonable - and will seek an urgent judicial review of the decision to ban defence evidence relating to a series of secret witness statements.

John William Goodwin's crimes, spanning 2001 to September 2012, left the women and their family members traumatised and caused them to feel unsafe in their own homes. Prosecutors had claimed Goodwin's offending was motivated by an insatiable desire to watch images of young female bodies undressed and being sexually stimulated. The 41-year-old was also ordered to serve a minimum of eight years in jail when he arrives before the Brisbane District Court next week, but Judge Christopher Ryan said he may never be freed. Mr Byrne said it was ""unusual"" for a court to record a sentence for a non-sexual offence of a child but defence advocate Damien Carlton described the judge's hands as tied - he agreed that there was sufficient evidence for a sentencing on Goodwin's offending to proceed. A search warrant was executed when a child pornography website notified police about child exploitation images of an eight-year-old Brisbane victim being sold in Russia around December 2011. Police found more than 1.5 million files of child pornography, including"

In Summary

When people are talking about global warming or climate change, they are talking about the fact that the overall atmospheric temperature is now hotter than in previous years, and higher overall over the past 100 years than in the last 1000 years, especially in the past few hundred years.

When most people ask what can we do to stop global warming, the response is usually to reduce our overall fossil fuel consumption. Some people even say that because of our use of fossil fuels, we may even be causing climate change: the atmosphere is now warmer than it should be, because of fossil fuels, because of carbon dioxide, because of methane gas released from melting polar icecaps, etc. So, the question is, can we limit our use of fossil fuels?

Fossil fuels are just a word for energy that comes from naturally occurring materials like oil, natural gas, coal and biofuels.

In order to extract these fuels, they are first extracted from the earth using the process of “hydraulically fracturing”, or fracking. Fracking involves drilling into the ground from thousands of feet below the surface, releasing pressure that allows natural gas and oil to be extracted. The process is extremely energy-intensive"

The Forney police had been looking for the car after receiving a report that someone had been waving a gun out of a stolen getaway vehicle.

Orange Says: ""I do not wish to commit to recording and promoting a new album"".

What is implied is that while he has no problem in making the album himself it would not be to a promotional standard the five band members would want.
What Orange should have said is: ""I do not wish to make the music for the new album to be released.""

And that would not be true because I have bought some of the greatest albums ever and still play them today - it's all about personal choice.

Why did they have to leave such a cryptic comment? All this suggests is that we are going to have a new album from the remaining three as the other three have no interest whatsover and the same song and dance will happen as with Progress (Robbie returned for one song).

Just put another album out and promote it fairly as the others did.

In a statement on Saturday morning, it read: ""The five remaining band members have spent some of the best years of their career together making music with their fans and after much consideration they agree they would like to continue as a five piece.
""This is now their focus and is where their energies and attention will continue to be dedicated to.

The band was started in 1990 by all five members, Nick Carter, Brian Littrell, AJ McLean, Howie Dorough, and Kevin Richardson. They recorded several albums together, the best-selling of which is Backstreet Boys, which was released in 1998.
In 1999, Nick Carter's twin brother Aaron was brought in as the manager. The band's song ""Larger Than life"" was a huge success, reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and spawning five official remixes, two of which were by McFly. The song also reached number five in the U.K.
The Backstreet Boys went on a hiatus in 2002 to allow all the members to pursue solo careers. The members kept in touch by phone and occasional visits. In 2003, McLean, Richardson, and Littrell performed a joint show, ""Back Home,"" which was televised on the Home Shopping Network.
In the fall of 2005, all five reunited to make a Christmas record through BMG Records. They continued to perform concerts both abroad and at home.
The two ""best friends"" of the band (AJ McLean and Howie Dorough) left in 2010.

In a heartbreaking piece about her late mother, a California woman shares a photo of herself looking forlorn and pregnant in a hospital bed as she lay across her dying mother's hospital bed. The heartbreaking image, snapped by her mother before she left the house and headed to the hospital, has gone viral, with more than two million shares on Facebook by Wednesday morning. The powerful post was prompted by her mother's last hours as she spent the evening, September 7, at home, telling family members and friends goodbye -- which included hugging them all, the girl wrote on her blog. But as the evening went on, her mother's health changed and, despite the efforts of the family members who were trying to hold her down, she went into cardiac arrest and stopped breathing -- and never regained consciousness. By the time they rushed her to the emergency room that was three hours away, doctors could try no more.

Doctors at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children and the Royal Victoria Hospital have warned that many women are suffering postnatal depression in Northern Ireland's health service and are not receiving the care they need.
The doctors say that the number of women being diagnosed with the disorder is rising but that there is a lack of specialist expertise and no mother-and-baby unit in the province.

Post-natal mental illness, or as it is commonly known, post-natal depression, affects around one in ten mothers here.
Dr Janine Lynch said the current situation is serious.
Post-natal mental illness can be chronic, even life-threatening, when a woman is not offered specialist treatment in either a hospital or by specially trained staff.
Dr Lynch says the current situation is serious: ""Women's lives are being put at risk due to the lack of specialist care. And none can be treated alongside their baby when they are feeling at their most vulnerable. Mother and baby have to be separated.""
At the moment Northern Ireland does not have an inpatient specialist mother and baby unit. In fact there is only one specialist psychiatrist for the entire region.
Therefore when a woman is admitted to hospital for post-natal depression treatment they are separated from their baby.
According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, on average, 75 Northern Ireland mothers per year require admission to hospital.

Ask her if she's been to see the hospital and been given an intake assessment.
She may not realise how little time it takes even with a busy life.
If she hasn't been told how postnatal depression is treated in hospital after birth, let her know she can see a team of specialists who will care for her and her baby together.
Encourage her to seek help. Ask where she's been. How often she's gone for help
How far along is she in her pregnancy?

Last month, West Virginia's governor is asking federal authorities to do more study on the possible health effects caused by a chemical spill near Charleston.

""It is critical this study is funded and that work begins immediately,"" wrote Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin in a letter Tuesday to Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

On January 9, the chemical company Chemguard spilled 100,000 barrels of a coal-cleaning chemical into water in Charleston's Elk River. It remains unclear what the spill has done to area waterways and wildlife.

The spill of the chemicals from a fertilizer plant spilled into the Elk River after a construction crew hit a gas line, setting off a series of explosions and a fire that burned for two days.

It remains unclear how much of the leaking 1,500-gallon drum of mixed ammonium nitrate went into local waterways, how toxic it was to fish, and what health hazards, if any, might result.

Hospitals in the British Health Service NHS are offering refresher courses on the highly-rated lifesaving procedure at little or no cost in a bid to boost survival rates.  According to the British Heart Foundation (BHF), there were some 5,800 cardiac arrests in Scotland in 2010 with only about two-thirds of patients surviving to see another day.

Research released by BHF scientists revealed that even one-in-10 people resuscitated on the floor outside a cardiac centre had a chance of surviving their heart attack. The new findings showed that the chances of survival increase when a bystander performs CPR within 5 minutes.

To help overcome this problem, the NHS across Britain is stepping in to ensure CPR training is being given to thousands more people.  The BHF, the national heart charity, will also offer a new series of courses on public access telephone systems to raise awareness of the importance of CPR.  The phone-based courses will use an automated system to train patients and relatives in CPR at home under the guidance of an instructor."

I'm so disillusioned with our situation that I'm even starting not to feel sorry for the Toon faithful and I've been one of their staunchest supporters. I hate the idea of Alan Pardew leaving...but where will we look to replace him now??

You don't go into a new league with a new manager with only a limited budget...the best example would be Wigan, and that was only possible as their owner is a fucking billionaire. We have Mike Ashley and I wouldn't even pay him a speeding ticket! We can't even attract a manager of any calibre...and if we get one we'll have to pay through the nose.

For a team of what looks very much like the same old faces, the performances have gotten an awful lot worse than they used to be.  But maybe that's just because Pardew is the manager.

I have to say that the club have made some good signings under Ashley-Pardew, and Pardew is a good manager, but the new signings aren't really up to scratch, and haven't meshed well with the team.  What I'd like to see is one or two young players brought in to play alongside the old boys - the club haven't made a good enough job of replacing the likes of Duff (who joined Liverpool when Pardew took over) and Shearer (who moved on to play for England, in the meantime).

On a positive note...

The team and the support seem to be pulling in one direction now and in this area the club must feel encouraged for the first time"

Pardew is considering Palace move from Caribbean holiday home

Newcastle manager Alan Pardew is hoping to be allowed to leave St James' Park by mutual consent if he is told by Mike Ashley that he wants to quit.

Pardew played more than 100 games for Palace during a four-year spell at the south London club.

The 56-year-old former defender, who scored eight goals for the Eagles, made 128 league appearances between 1987 and 1991, although his highlight was the FA Cup run in the 1989-90 season when the club threatened to overturn a 2-0 first-leg deficit in the semi-finals by beating Liverpool at Villa Park.

However, in the replay Pardew, along with Gary O'Reilly, Andy Gray and Mark Bright, scored the winning goal in a 4-3 win.

Meanwhile, former Palace chairman David Blitzer, who oversaw a rebuilding job at Selhurst Park between 1996 and 2003, is a possible replacement for Neil Warnock at Crystal Palace if he leaves the club, according to The Guardian.

Subject : Richard`s replacement on Top Gear

Hello Eric

I hope the weekend has been as fabulous as you are.
On a different topic the BBC are finalising Richard Hammond's replacement. So far the list includes Chris Evans, Chris Hoy, Matt LeBlanc, Matt Scott and Chris Packham. I think it is an easy choice for the BBC because Top Gear is the show that has sold the BBC. It is the BBC's main asset when trying to sell TV and film rights internationally. So the BBC have the top drawer talent of Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond and it is up to Chris Evans to sell the programme. I just hope that Matt LeBlanc hasn't signed a 10 year contract with the US network, USA Network, which has rights to the show. Chris Packham is"

67740,1,"Background :
--
The case started with the erection of a large outdoor LED Screen on the junction near and very close to the Cathedral, the installation taking approximately one month to complete. In effect, the screen had been built as a structure that appeared to stand alone within the right of way of Hill Street. The church at the back of the screen was an annexe to the Cathedral. The screen consisted of a number of large individual screen units that could be erected when required. The screens were mounted on wooden poles and supported with metal brackets. Metal edging was fitted around the screens.
The screen provided a blank background with darkening effects to give it prominence. The effect was to enhance prominence of the large street signage at the junction, and to reduce glare and visibility of the Cathedral.
The screen did not obstruct sunlight and would appear to be relatively invisible on a sunny day.
The council planning department had granted planning permission. Despite many objections, including one from the City and Strabane District Council, in January 2017 no applications to seek a Judicial Review of the planning permission were made by any local body.

Newry - Ireland (Press Association) -- The Catholic Church sought a judicial review after the screen
was installed on Hill Street close to Newry Cathedral in December 2015.
The church said it was not consulted about the screen - and that was a breach of planning rules.
The Newry Reporter said that the court overturned planning approval on Monday.
The church was also awarded ""reasonable costs"" to cover its legal fees.
The screen had caused controversy when it was installed because of its close proximity to the cathedral.
Canon Francis Brown, from the cathedral, told the BBC that the church and parishioners were ""delighted"" with the court's decision.
""We had a number of issues with the screen,"" he said.
""For one, it was in front of the most historic building in the city. It was also distracting from Masses and services held in the cathedral.
""Another issue was that people driving down Hill Street were seeing flashes on the screen and it was distracting drivers."""

The screen, a modern construction, which resembles a billboard, displays messages about events in Newry and County Down.

It has been described as a ""jaw-dropping"" move by a local historian.

The council say it had complied with its own planning procedures, which are aimed at protecting monuments, by having first taken permission from Newry Heritage Committee before applying for pre-planning permission.

It was initially refused by council planners on the grounds that there was already a permanent signboard outside the church, but an independent planning officer ruled that there was an unmet need for advertising in the town centre and granted permission for the temporary sign.

She will become the first woman to read the classified football results, which are broadcast  at 5pm on Saturdays, when Gordon retires after 40 years on the programme. Some listeners expressed mixed feelings when the decision was announced yesterday. Writing on Twitter one fan said ‘Charlotte Green is a funny name for a bloke’ while another asked: ‘A woman? Reading the football?’ Others were more supportive and celebrated the appointment of a woman. One posted: ‘Charlotte Green will be reading the football results on the BBC.

  The Magistrates' Association will debate plans to remove God from the oath sworn by witnesses and defendants at courthouses. A report prepared by a lay member of the association said that witnesses and defendants could say ```not lie at all'' ``` or ```tell the truth'' ``` without mentioning God. Critics say that change would undermine the country's Christian heritage.

It is a centuries-old tradition, but the Magistrates’ Association is expected to debate whether to scrap the oath to uphold the law.

The Magistrates’ Association, which represents 23,000 lay magistrates, will this month discuss concerns that many people do not take the oath seriously.

If its policy committee approves the changes it will draft proposals to send to the Ministry of Justice.

Ian Abrahams, 62, a Bristol magistrate who proposed scrapping the oath, said: ‘More and more I see people shrug their shoulders or say “whatever” when asked to take it.

‘I’m suggesting we take holy books out of the process. Instead, people will have to show they understand they could be sent to prison if they don’t tell the truth. ‘I don’t intend my motion to make any comment on religion. It is certainly not anti-religious.’

There is already an option for non-believers to take a secular oath, while those of other faiths can swear on their own holy texts.

71186,4,". ` A new proposal on oath-taking in court is raising concerns about the UK’s Christian heritage. In a series of debates this month, the Magistrates’ Association is considering the idea of scrapping the traditional Bible-swearing. Ian Abrahams, 62, a magistrate who proposed scrapping the oath, says a lack of faith is making people take it less seriously. If his proposal is adopted, judges and defendants would make sworn pledges not to lie. They would have to mention God – and could be jailed if they are caught out. Critics of the proposal argue that, by removing the public’s historic Christian beliefs, the UK is moving away from a more secular society.
