Like Google and Apple the social networking site is said to have used its headquarters in Ireland to avoid tax liabilities in the UK before directing earnings to a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands. British companies that buy advertising on Facebook must do so via Facebook Ireland Ltd which entitles the company to sidestep HM Revenue and Customs and authorities in other higher-tax jurisdictions, reported the Sunday Times today.

  Facebook 's tax affairs have been criticised, following a Sunday Times report which suggested it had paid $2.9m (£1.85m) in tax last year, despite generating $3.5bn earnings.
  The social network routed the majority of its overseas profits through an Irish subsidiary, which then redirected to a company in the British tax haven of Cayman Islands.
  This meant Facebook Ireland only reported a £15.1m loss in 2011, less than 0.2 per cent of the £448.2m it shifted to the Cayman unit.
  The US company's aggressive tax avoidance is believed to allow it to pay a corporate tax rate of less than 0.5 per cent.
  In comparison, Google had paid 1.6 per cent on a similar figure of profits, and Amazon 2.9 per cent.

This proposal, along with further plans for cutting jobs and a wage freeze, had worried trade unions and was vigorously opposed by campaigning politicians - including Nicola Sturgeon and MPs in Glasgow - as it would have cost thousands of jobs. The new investment means two new warships will be built at Govan and Scotstoun - where the first of the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers is currently under construction. Following a new assessment of the potential facilities options, BAE Systems has decided to retain and invest in both of its Glasgow shipyards.

## What do we mean by ""Cardinal""?

Cardinal is an official ecclesiastical title for certain members of the Roman Catholic (RCC) clergy. In English, the word cardinal takes its origin from the Latin adjective cardinalis (source and see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(Roman_Catholic_Church)) and has a meaning close to 'essential' or 'fundamental' or even 'indispensible'; the name of the bird comes from the same source.

In the RCC the cardinal is an important person, a Pope's helper who represents the Catholic Church within the world, so as to give support and advice to the Pope in his role of being the leader of the Church, and who elect the new Popes in the conclave.

But most analysts reckon Podemos will face a fierce battle for third place with Ciudadanos.
The PP has accused the left-wing party of supporting terrorism. Ciudadanos has played on the PP's problems of corruption, while Podemos has accused it of wanting to continue austerity policies and of being too close to the Vatican.

  David Cameron could hold a referendum on Britain’s future in the EU on the same day as the next general election in 2015 under an explosive plan being hatched by senior Conservatives. The Prime Minister yesterday opened the door to giving people their first say on Britain’s membership of Europe since 1975, although he insisted now was not the time for such a vote. Mr Cameron said he agreed with the ‘vast majority of the British people’ who were not happy with the UK’s relationship with the EU. Critics said his ‘definitely, maybe’ stance on a referendum was too vague to convince voters and appeared chiefly designed to appease Conservative MPs, who have been agitating for a referendum. But Mr Cameron said ‘tactical and strategic patience’ was required, insisting an immediate ‘in/out’ vote while Europe was in a state of flux and uncertainty was not what most people wanted. He intends to spell out this autumn a swathe of areas where he wants powers returned from Brussels to Westminster, including home affairs, employment law and social issues.

If you try to summarize the most important thing that both sentences say, you might find two major reasons for Cameron not to use the referendum on EU membership
1. it would be only weeks or even days before next month's EU summit to put all changes/return of powers to national parliament into practice (and this will never happen, so in a way, it would be just another lie to get more time to negotiate), and

It is also widely expected that the first increase won't signal a rapid tightening cycle to follow. Goldman and many other economists think that June is likely to see a 25bps hike to the range of 1-3.25%, and if we are correct in our forecast with the Fed, then we will see a total of three rate hikes this year, bringing us to 1%-1.25% by the end of the year, and a further two in 2016 before the Fed considers raising rates again.

She added that once rates started to rise, any increases would be gradual.

The upshot is a vastly superior menu for Virgin's upper class passengers and rejuvenated meals for children throughout the cabin  but  no change for those in standard class. Lorraine's upper class dishes – inspired by her love of healthy, light eating – will include Thai beef salad with roasted pine nuts and chilli dressing or a warm salmon and lentils with chorizo dish with asparagus and balsamic dressing. The children's dishes, on rotation over the next 12 months, will include 'marvellous' mac'n'cheese with pancetta pieces, crispy tender chicken strips with potato wedges and crushed peas, sweet and sour"

  ## How good is AI at writing these?

  The AI has to be at least as good as a human, if not better.

  And how useful would it be in journalistic terms? It could perhaps be used for summaries, as mentioned in other replies.

  It's unlikely to replace journalists, and it would depend on the topic and the specific style of writing.

  In some cases, AI can be surprisingly good at generating text that is highly similar to human writing.

  However, it would always be a good idea to double check the information before using it.

  ## ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI.

  It was designed to generate human-like text in natural language.

  It can be used to generate text in a wide variety of topics, including articles, stories, answers to questions, descriptions, poems, jokes, etc.

  ## Is it possible for GPT-4 to write news articles?

  Yes, it's possible.

Disability is a complex issue, and there are many ways for disabled people to be treated differently in society.

Wondering why it is hard for you to keep your eyes off the porn. The most likely reason you have a porn problem is, that you are a little too excited about it. Your hormones are constantly on the lookout, ready to react when it's time for action. Porn is like a big red button that triggers those hormones, makes your body release chemicals and makes your heart race! The problem starts when your hormones are out of balance and trigger chemical secretions which don't calm down after use. The effect of these are on your nervous system is the same as on your body.

It's not just the killing but what is seen as a clear double standard in the US justice system which makes people feel a grievance and act on it. The riots may be small in terms of the areas that have been affected and the number of people engaged but they have highlighted the extent and level of dissatisfaction in a number of cities, they have been a catalyst for a wider outpouring of emotion and they have revealed the extent of disaffection amongst blacks and other minority races.

The United States is exploring ways to cut off Iran's central bank from the global financial system and reduce the country's oil revenues, Geithner said at the briefing. Washington is in ""the initial stages of consulting with allies around the world about how best to achieve those goals,"" he said, adding that Japan's support was appreciated.

They did this analysis in about 180 samples of leukemia cells and found that the mutations were different than even in a single cell. They did this analysis in 5 children with leukemia.
This will have wide implications for how we use chemotherapy in children with leukaemia. A single dose of chemotherapy kills most of the cells in a tumour, but there is always a small percentage of tumour cells left over that may not have been killed or are too far from the chemotherapy. They are also the most probable source of mutations that allow the leukemia to grow back and resist future treatments. If these last few cells are found and killed the cancer might be gone forever.

  Although ALL is the most common type of leukaemia in children, it is actually made up of many subtypes. ALL is difficult to cure, and patients often relapse after seemingly successful treatment. One of the reasons why this type of leukaemia is resistant to treatment is that when a single leukaemia cell develops, it starts to mutate, so that a whole new population of leukaemia cells springs up. Because leukaemia cells are constantly under strong selection pressure, the leukaemia cells will rapidly diverge in a process called clonal evolution and will not respond well to therapies that are targeted to particular versions of the disease.
  To understand this process, we have compared the genes of leukaemia cells from five patients to see whether the patterns of mutation they had in common indicated an initial ""trunk"" from which the disease diverged.

59206,0,"The war in was one of the most controversial in the past half century, with questions raised in about almost every aspect of it. At the outset, several major intelligence failures related to the case for war, particularly the assessment of Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) program. The intelligence failures were at the top of the U.S. intelligence community and, in part, the products of a dysfunctional and bureaucratic community. However, the intelligence failures were also at the lower levels of collection and analysis, where human resources were inadequate. As the war progressed, there were a number of intelligence failures relating to operations in Iraq. These failures led to several fatalities for coalition forces. After the war, intelligence on the size and strength of the insurgent movement was grossly inaccurate. As a result, the U.S. military underestimated the strength and the numbers of the insurgent forces. Finally, intelligence collection from electronic-signals and the intercept community were inadequate and resulted in a number of U.S. casualties. ``` . .

43661,1,"Few of our actions in the global war on terrorism are as fraught with controversy, or as sensitive, as the employment of armed drones. Our government uses armed drones frequently, and often with deadly efficiency. Few other actions in the war on terrorism, and the war in Afghanistan, are as sensitive as targeted killings. If this is a war with conventional rules, and the drones represent one leg of the triad of special ops, surveillance, and drones that is now engaged to end this war as quickly as possible (and without the cost, in terms of lives, that previous US armed forces operations incurred), then our society does in fact have a serious stake in understanding the rules. And not just the legal, or ethical, or moral rules, but also the strategic rules. When President Obama took over as commander in chief, he promised to use drones sparingly. That hasn't happened, and while there is an important debate going on about whether our government should be spending this much money on a new kind of warfare, there are many more questions we should be asking. ```

Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) Three U.S. drone strikes killed five suspected al Qaeda militants after hitting two vehicles in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, two local security officials told CNN Thursday.
    The first strike killed three militants in al-Saeed district, the officials said. The other two strikes were in nearby Aal Mahdi district.
    A local government official who works in the governor's office in Aden confirmed the strikes.
    The military officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media.
    The deaths came a day after a drone strike in Yemen blew up two cars carrying suspected al Qaeda members, also in Shabwa province, killing one person, the officials said Wednesday.

Toxicology is a key science to apply in the care of the emergency patient. Understanding the basic principles of toxicology and the physiological effects of commonly encountered drugs and pharmaceuticals on the human body enables the practitioner to provide critical, time sensitive interventions, which in many cases may help prevent or delay the onset of permanent organ damage. Toxicology can be studied as a subset of emergency medicine or integrated into the study of toxicology in the undergraduate curriculum. The study of clinical toxicology includes the following topics.

The answer to this question is :
```The man who was at the head of the government of France during the French revolution is Louis XVI, the King of France from 9 May 1774 to 21 September 1792. He was born on 23 August 1754, died 21 January 1793 and ruled for his father who was then King at that time. On 21 September 1792, he was tried and convicted by the National Convention of treason against the French people. He was later executed by guillotine by the authorities of French Republic.

He tried to bring about a compromise and end the revolution by dissolving the States General in July 1789 which resulted in the formation of the Paris Commune and ultimately the storming of the Bastille.

PC Mark Goodlad was killed last night when his police BMW X5 was hit by a lorry driven at speed on the M62 near Leeds.

The two cars involved had stopped on the motorway as PC Goodlad, from the Greater Manchester Police's traffic unit, helped one woman after her car broke down.

Eddie Martin, a colleague who was in the police car behind the stricken vehicles, said Goodlad had just started to change the wheel when he heard the collision.

'It was like a gun going off, then all you could hear was the screams,' he told BBC Breakfast.

'There was no impact, no bang - the vehicle was just engulfed. He was just trapped between the lorry and the other vehicle.

```1.  India says it will allow family visits for death row prisoners

17 January 2016
From the section Asia
India's Home Minister Rajnath Singh
India will for the first time allow family visits for death row prisoners, officials say.
Cases of violence against prisoners, including against women, are rising, Human Rights Commission Chairperson Justice HL Dattu said on Thursday.
Mr Singh, who was chairing a two-day meeting to deliberate on reforms in the prisons, said jail officials have been asked to ensure the safety of female and weaker prisoners. The new guidelines come after several instances last year, including reports in northern Haryana state of women being subjected to sexual violence and of women dying in custody."
56377,4,"Prisoners in India - especially the poorer ones - will be given more access to family and legal support, the Ministry of Home Affairs announced today.
Last year alone, there were 400,000 inmates in the country.
Inmates will also be provided with better health care.
However, the plans have no mention of the controversial death penalty.

22083,3,"On the subject of Silvio Berlusconi Italians and non-Italians are, to paraphrase George Bernard-Shaw's famous quip about Britain and America, divided by a common political language. We think we share the view that in a political world dominated by mass communications, there is little room for forgiveness about scandals, or other personal failures, or a poor record in office. Yet on those grounds, Berlusconi should have died a political death long ago, rather than coming a very close second in this week's Italian elections. Foreigners, perhaps, will always remain baffled by Berlusconi's success in continuing to attract voters. But Italians, horrified by him though plenty of them are, tend to be a lot less surprised. That is because they think of him in context, rather than in isolation. In Italian politics, the context is all.

The text for the abstract is as follows:

The recent investigation of the Garda Síochána has been of interest to many, due to its complex nature and numerous allegations against the Gardai (the Police of Ireland). The investigation was carried out after certain senior Gardai attended a 50th birthday party, despite them being on duty that day. This has then lead on to many controversial allegations about the Gardai, including the murder of a 16 year old youth. To this day, the investigation of the Gardai has not been resolved, although the Gardai will remain as one of the most important aspects of our society."

Anne Cleary and Denis Connolly were inspired to make the helmets after exploring the pioneering experiments of psychologist George Malcolm Stratton in the early twentieth century. They wore special glasses that inverted images up and down and left and right for more than a week and discovered that the human brain could adapt to newly altered perceptions with practice.```` The link to the paper : `https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04620`"
18903,1,"The helmet is a piece of scientific research that seeks to change your point of view, literally. The idea is that it changes the way we view a horse's race, inverting the images so it's as though we were stood sideways. The idea of changing the way we perceive a race is the inspiration for this project. The first horse helmet was made by Irish artists, Denis Connolly and Anne Cleary in 2006. They took the idea and developed it into a new piece of art for the National Art Gallery in Ireland in 2009, and it has since been shown at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich and the National Museum of Ireland. Their research led them to discover that horse racing is actually really hard to see, which is why there are so many accidents - the inability to see what's going on around you and how fast you are moving. So now, using the helmet, the Irish artists have found that we have changed the way we perceive a race, the way we see the speed, the race itself, the other competitors and the crowd. But what about the race itself? Well, the horses don't notice a difference at all. That hasn't stopped"

# Vitamin D supplements for the primary prevention of disease: an update of Cochrane reviews

#### Autier P, Boniol M, Bougnoux P, Bucolo C, Bonafe M, Reid IR, Chang Y, Liu J,

##### Abstract

Vitamin D supplements are widely used worldwide and are usually taken orally, at doses from 800 international units (IU) to 2000 IU per day, or as monthly injections of 10,000 IU. Dose response curves that relate vitamin D intake or serum concentrations to clinical endpoints are essential to derive the doses needed to obtain benefits and minimise risks while avoiding unnecessary overdosing. We have searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 04, The Cochrane Library 2007), MEDLINE, EMBASE and other sources for randomised trials or observational studies of vitamin D and"
85272,1,"There is little evidence that vitamin D supplements could ward off a series of health problems, cancer, heart disease, stroke, dementia and osteoporosis. The French scientists who studied 462 studies involving 1 million people, now suggests low vitamin D levels occur as a result of a disease rather than the other way round. ``` I also tried to write article specific title and description, see below:

Vitamin D is taken by millions of people worldwide to protect against a wide range of diseases, for example cancer, heart disease and stroke, but a new study led by the International   Prevention   Research Institute published in The Lancet has shown   they have   little effect, at least for older people.   The   results reveal a lack of evidence that supplements containing vitamin   D protect against more than 17 diseases, for example cancer, heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s disease,    multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. The   researchers, led by Philippe Autier from the International Prevention Research Institute, have carried out a meta-analysis of 462 studies involving more than a million adults using vitamin D supplementation during a minimum follow-up of one year.   They concluded that further high quality studies are needed before supplementation can be encouraged in healthy people.

22748,3,"In the 1950s and ’60s, with smoking and drunkenness on the rise, firefighters became concerned that public facilities were not being built to deal with the increasing need for fire safety. By the 1970s these fears had not been allayed. Fire exits were poorly signed and the fire-resistant materials of the 30s and ’40s had fallen into disrepair.

Around 1975, a 97-year-old woman was killed when her house caught fire, and the fire service had to fight the blaze with the help of three brigades, a special appliance, and water carts; one fireman had to make his way through the house with just a hosepipe. This was clearly the result of lack of investment [in fire safety]. In 1976 a committee was set up under the chairmanship of MP Sir John Burn, to look into the problem of fires in public buildings.

After its inquiry in 1983, the Burn Committee called for a radical overhaul of how building regulations worked. The government should provide more fire-fighting teams,"

The NFL has many other rivalries that are great to watch, one of the best is between the New England Patriots and the New York.

    Giants have gone the length of the division but it’s still early days. We are still half way through the season, so teams can take control or go in any direction. I’m expecting a really close game on Sunday, you can’t ever predict what way an NFC East game will go because on any given Sunday someone can beat both of those teams.

Endeavour has been sitting there since this past spring, when shuttles previously on the two launch pads were moved back and forth as needed to accommodate both Discoveryâs May 2009 mission and STS-127 mission in mid July.

Mission Manager Pete Nickolenko said, even with Atlantis's successes, Endeavour's presence is appropriate. ""We have worked over the years to develop a culture for backup space shuttles,"" he said. ""You just can't assume it's okay.""

NASA engineers and flight controllers say that if Atlantis runs into trouble, it will need to remain docked to the Hubble space telescope through to the end of Atlantis's 11-day mission, ending on 26 May. To avoid leaving Atlantis high and dry, shuttle managers, in effect, are keeping Endeavour chained to Atlantis.

It takes approximately 2 1/2 seconds for a tree to fall, so after 1 second of observation in a public pavement situation where people are rushing to get to work, it would be more likely for pedestrians to attempt to cross the tree by foot. There should have been better protection put around the tree, with a tree protection officer being involved as well, as well as a tree felling officer. The root ball was the size of a small car.

The victims were either shot dead or beaten to death, Dong-A said, adding he was later shot and captured by Chinese authorities.

He said some of those places would be filled with people from camps on the border of Syria rather than those already in Europe. Mr Cameron said he wanted to see more safe corridors created as a way of getting more help to people, saying there are more than 20 refugees or asylum seekers arriving in Europe per day. He said any refugee who arrived in Europe should get the same kind of treatment and protection ""wherever they choose to start their journey in Europe"". He added that the government was working with the French to find ways of tackling gangs helping people traffic themselves across the Eurotunnel, saying: ""I am keen to work with the French government to see what more we can do to crack that, to cut off that route that people are using so dangerously and so illegally.""

Britain will take in 1,000 migrants from refugee camps, Cameron says.
They will come from in or near countries affected by the war, rather than those already in Europe.
Aid organisations estimate 5 million refugees are displaced in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey and 1.2million have arrived in Greece and Italy in the past six months.
Mr Cameron said the UK had always accepted asylum claims from Iraqi, Syrian, and Sudanese refugees and there was no reason to change that, though it might take time to put measures in place.
The PM said other countries should do more to help migrants in Europe and he has invited EU leaders to discuss the issue at a summit later this month.

Our ambition is to help a million refugees in the region find security and opportunity, not come to Britain. This means helping to build a better future for people in neighbouring countries and tackling the threat that causes so much of this migration in the first place. This Government will fund a new £100m Refugee Support Strategy. The UK has so far contributed £730m to support the refugees, but we can do more. The strategy, run through the Department for International Development, will help displaced people in camps in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, where millions are unable to get jobs or a decent education. That means better shelter, medical care, schools and support to rebuild their economies. It will help with the education of two million children and ensure three million have access to clean water and sanitation. That support for refugees is vital, because we are at the front line of a growing challenge that is overwhelming border controls in Europe. The numbers coming is putting huge pressure on the camps to the south of Europe where millions of people are struggling to survive and more migrants are arriving every day. The more people come"

The aim is to relieve the pressure caused by such large groups of people. The refugees will be given refugee status for one year and will get financial aid to move to the UK to get an asylum for humanitarian reasons. UK will receive 4,500 refugees from Turkey, with 2,500 of those coming in the first six months of the Syrian war. Other parties and refugee NGOs have expressed that the help is welcome but that is should be more. There are a lot of refugees in Turkey and the Turkish government is struggling to offer help with the Syrian refugee crisis. Many refugee families have fled their homes, taking only the belongings they can carry, leaving their homes and belongings behind. Turkey has responded by providing a significant level of humanitarian aid but this needs to be further supported. In addition, thousands more have made the long journey to Greece, seeking a safe place to continue their journey into Northern Europe.'' ```

The man was shot with an arrow when members of the isolated Mashco Piro tribe invaded his village, Shipetiari, in the rainforest. It is the third time this year that the Mashco Piro people have been seen. Anthropologists say they were probably looking for tools or food. However, it is not known why the Mashco Piro attacked. The group is estimated to number around 600 and they live in separated  groups, constantly moving through the forest. They occasionally make makeshift shelters along river banks and dig for turtle eggs. Peru's government has forbidden physical contact with them and another dozen or so ""uncontacted"" indigenous tribes because they have little immunity or resistance to illnesses that other humans carry. Anthropologists say that in the area of jungle where they have been seen, near the Madre de Dios river in southern Peru, some locals have been trying to tempt the Mashco Piro out of the forest with rewards, pitying what is seen as a primitive existence. The Peruvian government has been financing a group of indigenous specialists for some time in the area to deal with contacts between settled communities"

In this article , we show that the semigroup . of partial permutations with an antisymmetric accessibility relation is finite if and only if it is isomorphic to a subsemigroup of . $M1$ $*$ $M2$ $\cong M1 \oplus M2$, where $M1$ and . $M2$ are finite inverse semigroups with the trivial or identity condition. $*$ denotes the product of semigroups.

Pig farmer hits cop; goes to jail

SUMMARY

A police officer is in a critical condition after the car he
collided with was struck by a Volkswagen Corrado which drove
into his lane and hit him while he was riding a pushbike..

The car crashed into the traffic island and overtook it to
head into a ditch...

The damage to the Volkswagen from the crash is severe enough
that police are trying to ascertain the owner of the vehicle
involved in the accident.

As the car had only been recently purchased, police believe
the purchaser may have been aware of the damage to it and is
trying to track them down in the hope that they may lead to
the driver of the car involved...

However, the car is an automatic vehicle and police are not
able to establish whether the driver could have caused the
accident or it merely being driven into their lane."

He asked President Sergio Mattarella to allow another six weeks for passing the budget bill. President Mattarella agreed to the request for time on practical grounds. Mr Renzi’s centre-left Democratic Party had pledged to hold general elections within six months. However, the anti-establishment parties such as the Five Star Movement have called for early parliamentary elections even though it is difficult to implement them within six months. Prime Minister Renzi campaigned extensively to pass the referendum. The approval would have streamlined the Senate, Italy’s second house of parliament, which has a limited role. It would also have made it easier for the government to pass reforms. However, the vote has ended his premiership and he is likely to be succeeded by a care taker government.

TANDEM-X could not detect features with height below threshold of 0.5 meters above the mean sea level. The other type of error is caused by the so-called “double pass effect”, which is not possible to eliminate completely - because SRTM orbit direction is not always the same, we can obtain different results from the same area which may add together to result in doubled DEM. These errors are caused by different factors, but they can both result in high noise level in the SRTM/TANDEM-X DEM. This means that no accurate analysis of this DEM can be done unless the errors are reduced or eliminated. ```

This is due, in part, to an alliance between the Labor Party and the nationalist Scottish National Party (SNP). The SNP currently holds the largest majority of seats in the Westminster Parliament, but does not yet have a majority (65 seats in total). If Labour is able to win seats due to the support of the SNP in the 2015 parliamentary elections, we could see a power shift of the SNP supporting Labour, which may cause Britain's Labor Party, which will lead to the possible relocation of the submarine facility.

5808,3,"The curved rod discovered in Romsdal province, Norway, in 1894, has long been a curiosity: it seems to be a rod or spit with a hooked end, suitable for roasting or spearing fish or for catching fish. The shape of the object has led to the suggestion that the hooked end represented a head and thus suggested a link with a staff of office rather than fishing. The staff was published in the context of discussions that placed it in the category of magical objects. A recent examination of the object noted its shape: the curve being a recurve similar to a harp bow. The suggestion is that the object's hooked shape resulted from a deliberate shaping to be ineffective for fishing. An examination of similar objects in the British Isles reveals that the staff probably does have a magical association, and a further consideration of archaeological parallels in the British Isles and Scandinavia has led to the conclusion that the object's magical function is that of a staff of office. Runes carved on stone crosses indicate that magic was associated with Scandinavian paganism, and the owner of the staff was probably a 'sieve-woman' (a common woman of"

And if you remember the previous example, you’re going to get absolutely and completely NOTHING back if it involves drugs or the police say that it was suspicious.

Atlético Madrid lifted the UEFA Super Cup in style, beating Inter Milan 2-0 in Monaco courtesy of goals from Jose Reyes and Sergio Aguero.

Defeat was compounded for Inter on a miserable night for the Italian champions after new manager Rafael Benítez was sent off with eight minutes remaining.

Inter also had goalkeeper Julio Cesar to thank after making a string of impressive stops in the first half to keep his team in touch with their opponent but it"

### Summary

The UK does not even rank among the top 10 countries for producing billionaire entrepreneurs. Although it has a higher number than countries in the Eurozone it still lags behind the likes of Hong Kong, the USA, Australia, Canada and Ireland.

### Motivation

The purpose of this article is to show how UK ranks is low the number of entrepreneurs with the wealth above $1 billion. Also to show the comparison with the rest of the countries, which are more successful.

### Introduce

Entrepreneurs are people that start businesses and take major risks to develop and grow that business into a profitable venture.
As it says in the Wikipedia  article, this entrepreneurship is vital for economic growth due to the risks that they are willing to take to start their business and also since they create jobs for many people.

### Method

Mr Belhadj is taking legal action against former British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw over claims that Mr Straw signed papers authorising the move.
It is thought to be the first time civil action of this kind has been taken against a former foreign secretary.
Mr Belhadj - known in the jihadi world as Abu Abdullah al-Sadiq - commanded the now defunct Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG).
The group was formed in 1990 by Islamist Libyans who had fought in Afghanistan against Soviet forces in the 1980s.
The LIFG waged a three-year low-level insurgency mainly based in eastern Libya, and staged three attempts to assassinate Col Gaddafi in 1995 and 1996, according to Middle East analyst Omar Ashour of Exeter University.
By 1998, the group was crushed. Most of its leaders fled to Afghanistan and joined forces with the Taliban. There, Mr Belhadj is alleged to have developed ""close relationships"" with al-Qaeda leaders and Taliban chief Mullah Omar, according to an arrest"

The president-elect is due to hold a news conference on Wednesday, nine days before taking office, according to reports.
But it comes at an awkward time for the Republican president-elect as reports of alleged wrongdoing and corruption continue.
The president-elect and his predecessor have been said to have heard about his alleged conduct through reports.
They were presented in a wider classified report on alleged interference by Russia in the presidential elections.
For more than two months now, the President-elect has been under pressure to agree with the conclusions of the U.S. spy agencies, which says Russia was behind the hacking of the Democrats' election campaigns.
They said that the order came from Russia to sway the election for the Republican candidate, and against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.
The Russian government has denied involvement in the hacking, and accused U.S. of political persecution.

Caglar continues by pointing out that the number of people who will read the IEEE paper is much smaller than those of the ArXiv, and that while the IEEE is publishing 14 papers, they have published some 1.2k+ papers this past year. I would like to point out that it seems to me that the people who are interested in computer security are mostly not interested in the papers themselves, but in the underlying system, and there has not been a lot of research on this since the 1960s. To my mind, there are a number of reasons for this: the computer science field is largely dominated by the computer science departments at elite institutions, and those in the field today can only view the field in terms of the way that their graduate coursework is taught. Many academics who are writing papers on computer security today have not had the benefit of a formal systems education. For instance, many of the people involved in the SCOX trial in the 1990s had received graduate degrees from"

After the match, Southampton's Mauricio Pellegrino criticized Nigel Clough for comments that were made during the match, while the Sheffield United boss was equally angry with the Chilean's remarks.

Southampton's Jose Fonte: After a tough time we wanted to achieve something special... it's a disaster. Jose Fonte has condemned Southampton's League Cup fourth-round exit to Sheffield United . The Portugal international defender felt the Southampton players had responded positively to a torrid sequence of results, but they blew a golden chance to reach the last four, instead losing at a wet and windy Bramall Lane on Tuesday night. ""After a tough time we wanted to achieve something special,"" said Fonte, who watched as Marc McNulty scored the winning goal 16 minutes inside the second half. ""It's a disaster because there are five or six clubs who would really have liked to have been in the semi-finals. ""We had a great opportunity but we couldn't take it. Everybody should be very disappointed.""

Specific actions are not specified, but the author calls for ""a pledged money for nets, anti-malarial treatments and research for a vaccine"" - a fundraising effort. The initiative is said to ""raise awareness of the disease and efforts to control malaria around the world.""

50691,2,"Roll Back Malaria is a global campaign established in 1998 by the United Nations, the World Bank and the World Health Organization, as part of a Global Millennium Project. The goal of the partnership is to control malaria by reducing malaria deaths by 50% by 2010 through the implementation of strategies to control, prevent and treat malaria. April 25 is the World Malaria Day established by the Roll Back Malaria partnership to bring attention to global malaria issues, the ongoing efforts to eliminate the disease and the resources needed to fight it. Malaria is a preventable and treatable disease caused by parasites transferred to people through the bite of infected mosquitoes. People suffering from malaria typically develop high fevers and severe flu symptoms, and in severe cases they develop coma and experience multiple organ failure and death. A vaccine to prevent malaria has been researched and developed by Glaxo Smithkline and was tested in 1987 in an African field trial in Tanzania and Malawi. The vaccine did not prevent malaria in adults or young children but in children older than 5 years old the vaccine prevented 30% of clinical malaria cases."
50691,3,"The article discusses World Malaria Day, which is held on April 25 to raise awareness of malaria, an often-deadly disease preventable and curable that has plagued every country except Antarctica, and to generate funding to eradicate it. However, despite the disease being preventable, it continues to be a public health threat, with 2015 statistics revealing that it disproportionately affects those in developing countries, causing an estimated 584,000 deaths. In 2000, WHO Member States had committed to reducing deaths from malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis by 2015. This article discusses how the international community pledged money to combat the malaria epidemic by donating funds towards treatments and a vaccine. The World Health Organization established the Roll Back Malaria strategic framework, which aims to reduce child and maternal malaria-related deaths. The article also examines initiatives like the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which has supported malaria programs that have impacted more than 700 million people and saved more than 6 million lives."

US President Obama took a humorous, playful approach in delivering the final State of the Union speech of his nearly 2-term presidency on Tuesday (28 Jan).  In this 78-minute address, the President outlined the state of the country and addressed an array of contentious topics including healthcare, education, climate, energy, terrorism, racism, sexism, LGBT discrimination, immigration, economic inequality, middle class, minimum wage, manufacturing, free trade agreements, and global power.   This speech was widely described as one of the most personal and emotional of his White House tenure as the President focused on the changes and impact his Administration has carried out during the past 7 years and the achievements and gains of the country over the past 8 years.

The President began by referencing the most recent school shooting in Oregon that just took place 2 days prior to State of the Union and urged lawmakers not to give up in their attempts to prevent such massacres in the future.

According to this article, Warner Bros. has announced that their release date of ""The Great Gatsby"" has been pushed back one year from December 25th, 2012 to a as yet unspecified day in Summer 2013.

The move, which seems to be a common theme regarding this film, follows the release of several trailers, the most recent in May. In addition, the movie had received a PG-13 rating from the MPAA on May 20th.

A more interesting question is why. Firstly, the main cause seems to be the desire to release the final movie in summer. This indicates several reasons. The most obvious is to appeal to a wider audience, particularly older male viewers, who might have been attracted to the Christmas release.

Fair enough. It does exist. This is the only caliphate today.

I do not agree with their version of islam, but I am sure that there are millions who do.

Islamism has not even been able to conquer Spain on two attempts, even with cannons. All islamist terrorism is still based on these two failed attempts.

It is one more example of this religion gone mad. And if you are not with us, then you are against us.

I really hope that they will be able to defeat them soon.

Lomas, 21, of Munno Para West, pleaded guilty in the Adelaide Magistrates Court to causes serious harm to Luke Coburn on 9 January 2013, and was remanded to stand sentence on 26 September in the district court.

BACKGROUND:
Luke had been 16 years old at the time, and was at the home of a friend when the pair were approached by Lomas, one of two people who set fire to Luke by pouring a flammable liquid over him.

Luke sustained third-degree burns to his ears, neck and arms. He was hospitalised for five weeks, where he had to undergo a skin graft surgery.

Luke says that the reason he was chosen was because the attacker was jealous of his girlfriend.

55447,2,"Fair play to Everton. They've had the refs against them all week. On Boxing Day Lee Mason refused to send Stoke's Jon Walters off when he pulled Leighton Baines back when clean through on goal -- Everton lost that game. Then on Sunday, with his Everton team a goal up, Papiss Cisse clearly elbowed Seamus Coleman twice while waiting for a corner to be taken. Newcastle forward Papiss Cisse (circled) was lucky to stay on the pitch after elbowing Seamus Coleman . Coleman holds his face after being hit with a elbow by Cisse during Newcastle's win over Everton . Referee Craig Pawson appeared to be looking towards Cisse but he must have looked away, twice, to have missed the clear violent act which should have resulted in a routine red card for Cisse, who then scored Newcastle's equaliser. Former Newcastle manager Graeme Souness said Coleman might have broken his jaw. Gary Neville added: 'It's the most certain red you will ever see.' They were both right! That moment proved to be the turning point as moments later Newcastle equalised through Cisse'"
55447,3,Refs are getting it wrong again!!```
55447,4,"Martinez has been unlucky with referees over the festive period. First, Mason did not send off a player although he was pulling a man back when the attacker should have been rewarded with a red card. Coleman was the next victim when he was hit by an elbow which, had it been any other player, would have earned a red card. However Coleman was the victim of one of the most obvious decisions missed by a referee this season. While the decision did not cost the team the game, the manager questioned the referee's decision, which cannot be disputed.```"

It was used initially as a shelter for the cats but there is no sign of water or electricity and it was very difficult to escape in the winter months due to the ice on the ground so it is hard to escape. The cats are quite lucky though in that they haven’t had to go hungry. The cats are fed by the people living there and it is a nice situation because they can just go and play outside when they need to.

The cats are in good condition and they make excellent companions. The ones that are left over are kept in kennels in case they need a home. If you find a cat that you think is a cat or if you know someone who has a cat that is in need, please take a few moments to let us know. The cats need to be given to us so that we can pass them on to loving families that will give them as much attention as they need.

Cat rescued after being trapped in flood waters in the United Kingdom
A family returned to their home town to see the damage to their house after flooding. They heard the faint callings of a cat trapped in the attic. It took a team of 4 firemen to rescue the trapped animal. The cat was reunited with its owner but had suffered a broken leg.
The flooding caused chaos to the areas. Cars were floating and people were told to evacuate. After the flooding cleared a small cat had been left stuck in the attic of a house for 3 days. They heard it calling for help. It had been drinking after the flooding had started to recede. Firemen were able to rescue the animal without injury. (Daily Express 1618-072)

This was to be expected, given his love for the army and his extensive travels. Among the stops on his itinerary were the Near and Middle East (now the Islamic Republic of Iran) as well as Turkey. And when he made his final visit to Turkey in 123 AD, he took with him a monumental statue, representing the goddess Artemis, to be placed in his newly built temple at Ephesus in Asia Minor. Unfortunately, the 8.2 m tall headless statue was badly damaged in the earthquake that destroyed the temple in 178. The statue,"

Marines diagnosed with same kind of cancer.

When their two-year-old son was diagnosed with a life-threatening brain tumor, Devon and Valerie Morse didn't think it could get much worse. But just weeks later, Devon, who is a Marine, also began feeling sick and doctors revealed the unthinkable: that he, too, had a brain tumor.

Now the family, who live at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in Havelock, North Carolina, are trying to come to terms with the news as they attend medical appointments across the state.

33654,1,"Painted Lady butterflies make an epic intergenerational migration that stretches 6,000 miles each way. Painted Lady butterflies make a spectacularly long journey each summer from breeding grounds in Africa to their overwintering sites further north in Europe. They cross the Mediterranean to breed in the Mediterranean basin, and make a return journey heading north to Britain in July, sometimes in staggering numbers, like in 1992, when one million landed at St Austell in Cornwall, where they stayed for two days. From there they are seen heading north all over the country, including in my back garden. A Painted Lady butterfly sits atop lilac flowers.

It has a variable appearance and can be brown, greenish or orange/yellow in colour. The sexes are similar. Up to six generations are produced in the temperate north, but only two or three in more southerly latitudes. The butterfly migrates to the north in the spring and to the south in the autumn. In Europe the butterfly is found locally in most countries except Germany, Poland, Scandinavia and most of the British Isles. ``` _more summaries available!

# The Migration of Painted Lady Butterflies!

- The Painted Lady is a beautiful summer butterfly which has a distinctive black tail with a white edge and two orange bands across the black wings. It is considered by some to be Britain’s favourite butterfly. Its Latin name is Vanessa cardui and it is often referred to as the Thaime (also spelt Thyme!) by many. The Painted Lady is a member of the Nymphalidae, or brush-footed butterfly family. This family is characterised by the way it walks by having the forelegs adapted with stiff hairs and pads so it can grip things like bramble stalks to climb with ease.

In a row over the Welsh finance secretary's budget speech, Mr Price said investment in mid and west Wales would be less than 30% by the end of the current financial year.

On Tuesday's budget, Mr Price claimed the Welsh government's capital spending in mid and west Wales would be less than £1,000 per person, while spending in the Valleys would top £3,000. Plaid secured £30m for a bypass in its constituency when it supported the budget. It was Mr Price's tweet about the bypass that provoked a sharp rebuke from Mr Waters. Asked if he regretted the tweet, Mr Price said he didn't but ""regretted the attitude"". ````"

## What is cancer?

Cancer is the uncontrollable growth and spread of cells in the body. These cells are called tumors and are generally found in the brain or the bone, but can also develop in blood vessels, the liver, the pancreas, the lungs, the ovaries, and the kidneys. They can also be found in the skin, bladder, prostate, stomach, bowel, and the bladder.

## What causes cancer?

The majority of people with cancer develop it through lifestyle factors. Some of these include:
1) Smoking
2) Alcohol
3) Infection
4) Vitamin C

Mr Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, said there was an ""absurd"" gap between what the poorest families received in benefits and those of their well-off neighbours.   In recent years, the Labour Government increased public spending on tax credits to offset rising costs and to provide extra incomes for poor families. However, the benefit system was blamed for trapping people in unemployment by failing to provide adequate incentives for them to work. Benefits will be capped next year, with the limit rising yearly in line with inflation.
Working people were also being squeezed in the economy, which was ""at serious risk"" of double-dip recession after the slow pace of growth during the past nine months, the Chancellor said.   This is ""an unacceptable situation"" as the economy relies on the spending of the working majority who pay their bills and put money back into"

Her diagnosis was made public during an on-air mammogram, and she has been the subject of several GMA stories since, as well as giving interviews to other news shows and magazines. When she learned she had breast cancer, she decided to go public because she saw a gap in the knowledge and communication of the disease and needed more information.

Robach was recently named the co-anchor to GMA alongside George Stephanopoulos; however, she has been reporting on the daily show for the past several months and it was previously known that she would be replacing Josh Elliott, who left the show abruptly last month.

The law applies to all 50 states and U.S. territories where hate crimes -- inappropriate violence by people motivated by prejudice -- are not specifically outlawed. The new addition of sexual orientation opens it up to more areas of prejudice in our society and will help those who are attacked because of their sexual orientation or gender expression. I believe the addition of sexual orientation does not open the doors to attack those who preach against homosexuality. Those who try to use the addition of sexual orientation must think logically and realize that there is a huge distinction between homosexuality as an action (or behavior) and homosexuality as an orientation (internalized sexual identity).

HealthDay Review, June 21, 2008

``` If home is where the heart is, a new survey suggests that most people aren't sure exactly where they live.

More than half of people cannot pinpoint the exact location of the human heart on a diagram, and nearly 70 percent can't correctly identify the shape of the lungs, according to the survey.

This lack of knowledge isn't just embarrassing -- it could lead to a poorer quality of health care, some experts say.

In the study, published in the journal BMC Family Practice, a research team surveyed 722 Britons -- 589 hospital outpatients and 133 people in the general population. They gave the volunteers four diagrams of human figures and asked them to choose the one that showed the correct size and location of a specific organ.

A questionnaire was developed to measure the awareness about eight body parts (the heart, lungs, stomach, thyroid, pancreas, kidneys, bladder, and brain) out of the 589 participants recruited from hospital outpatient departments, and 133 subjects from the general population. Subjects were presented with four drawings depicting the size and position of each body part within a frontal view of a human body in various positions (e.g. an organ drawn in the middle of the left chest cavity, an organ on the far left, and an organ on the right-hand side).

Everton boss Ronald Koeman will continue to assess his options but is not panicked despite not buying last summer.

The team has started the season well yet a couple of injuries have put his plans out the window, or so it may seem.

The manager had hoped to sign at least two more players by now and the January window will be crucial yet he will not get carried away in his haste to buy simply for the sake"

Democrats and Republicans alike will join voices and sing ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" ""God Bless America"" and other patriotic songs.

Sometimes it means things are about to fall apart.

The health department has contacted 430 people who may have been exposed and need to be tested as a result of exposure to the three, the officials said. Health officials declined to say whether the three were students or teachers. They also said they did not know what strain of TB the three contracted. The first case of tuberculosis at Robert E. Lee High School was diagnosed in December 2012, and the health department opened and completed an investigation, the agency said. But because two more people from the same school were diagnosed with it in June, the department re-opened the December case and is investigating whether they are related. TB bacteria usually attack the lungs, but they can also attack other parts of the body such as the kidneys, spine and brain, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If not treated properly, TB can be fatal.```"
74664,3,"The article presents a news brief about a Tuberculosis outbreak in Virginia. Fairfax County in Virginia has reported three people testing positive for tuberculosis (TB). The affected people are three out of 430 people who may have been exposed to the disease. Health officials have not revealed the identities of the infected persons. However, they have stated that the TB infection was detected in December 2012 and an investigation was opened and closed soon after. The outbreak has prompted a health department to intervene and investigate the matter. Health officials stated that it is difficult to determine whether the new cases are related to the older case. TB is a contagious bacterial disease that mostly affects the lungs. If untreated, it can lead to death. Health officials have advised people affected by the disease to get tested so that a proper treatment can be started to prevent the disease from spreading among the infected people. People with compromised immune systems, such as infants and young children, the elderly, and people with serious health conditions, are at higher risk of developing TB infection. The article further highlights the importance of timely treatment to prevent the spread of the disease.

Dear Members
Past outbreaks have devastated great ape populations, particularly gorillas, where the virus is estimated to have wiped out a third of the primates. A scientific team now says that wild gorillas could be vaccinated to protect the critically endangered animals from further losses. However some conservationists warn that this would be difficult and has risks. The study is published in the journal Scientific Reports. Dr Peter Walsh, from the University of Cambridge, who led the research, told BBC News: ""Now that we have shown this is a safe vaccine, it's really a moral imperative that we use it. ""The disease is a huge threat to gorillas right now.  We vaccinate our children, we vaccinate livestock, we vaccinate our pets, we vaccinate wildlife  - why aren't we vaccinating our closest relatives?""

60256,4,"Chimps were chosen, rather than gorillas, because they are physiologically more similar to humans, and so the vaccine's safety was more closely modelled on humans.
The vaccine, which had been tested on humans before, was given through an injection into the back of their neck.
The scientists then waited to see if it caused any problems - from swelling round the injection site to allergies or fevers.
They found that the animals did have immune responses in the first few days after vaccination but no ""adverse events"" on the day or in the following days, and no one was found to have antibodies to the Ebola virus before the trial vaccination.
This finding, say the scientists, suggests that the vaccine will pose no risk to humans or apes.
So, if the vaccine could be given to gorillas, could it help them?

Parma Bertoli, 59, met Stephanie Nickles, 43, while they were both men in 2004. Stephanie had a procedure funded by the NHS in 2006. Parma followed with her own procedure in 2008. The couple's birth certificates were updated to reflect their new female identities. The couple are planning to tie the knot next month. Unfortunately, due to Parma's recent diagnosis of a terminal brain aneurysm coupled with complications of his diabetes, the couple have chosen to move forward with the wedding quickly so that they can be married - as their relationship spans back from when the couple fell in love as men and plan to continue that loving relationship as women.

He met his partner Stephanie Nickles at a pub four years ago when he was still a man. Parma is also a former meat inspector and had spent time serving as a soldier in South Africa. He started the procedure after he noticed some issues in his sexual identity at the age of 18. The NHS provided Parma with £10,000 and covered about 90% of the total cost, which included hormone therapy and surgery. The couple now live together as a woman and their relationship lasted for about twelve years.

It's not a meme post, but an article post.

5162,2,"Steven Gerrard spoke of being a better man after private sessions with psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters. Changed: Steven Gerrard praised the appointment of psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters to the team staff . 'I had one-on-one meetings with him,' revealed Gerrard ahead of Wednesday night's clash with Denmark at Wembley.'I understand the different parts of the brain, how they work, when they function and why you think certain things, why you bite your children's heads off from time to time, blame Alex for everything - blah, blah, blah.' There will be scepticism about Peters' appointment for the World Cup, but this is a smart move. Gerrard was brave enough to confront his demons at a time when he wondered whether he would ever play for Liverpool or England again. 'I'd seen three or four surgeons and they weren't really convincing me that I could play again so I turned to him. 'He helps you with positivity, the power of thought and staying upbeat, that sort of stuff. Without being a drama queen it was a very important stage in my career.' He said. ```





Keywords: psychology,"
5162,3,"text In England, former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was in a bad mood and he took it out on his wife Alex and his kids,
  Lilly-Ella, Lexie and Lourdes. He was talking in terms of biting her head off, and they were the recipients of any sort of frustration. He blamed her for everything. And those situations were, obviously, in a domestic setting, behind closed doors. That is when he first realized he might need some help, and his physio told him about Dr. Steve Peters, who helps athletes with their mind, and has been working with England’s national football team for a while. And so he sought him out. As Gerrard said, there are some times when he thinks everyone is against him; like when he had a groin avulsion, which was career-threatening. He went to three or four surgeons, and they were not very convincing to him, as in that he really could play again. And then a physio mentioned Dr. Peters, who is known for the best, and so he sought him out eventually. Peters helps these footballers with positivity, staying upbeat, and that sort of thing.

They could go further and get into the Premier League by winning automatic promotion. However, it could all come crashing down when the Football League rule-makers slap them with a transfer ban in the New Year. This is a very fair and important rule - one that was clearly needed when you look at the fact that the two most successful clubs in the Premier League in the last three seasons were Chelsea and Manchester City, who have spend hundreds of millions of pounds to make sure that they stay in the rich English top flight - but for this rule to be effective the punishment has to be fair and effective. A ban on transfer activity in the final months of the regular season is a major blow, for obvious reasons, because the squads were already made when they were banned. Some teams might actually benefit from this ban, because the managers now have more freedom to use their own judgement about who needs to be kept and who needs to be moved on.

Jones was not in favor of the Iran rescue mission. When his recommendation to postpone was rejected by Carter, he reportedly went to work drafting his resignation.

Jones was also reportedly out of favor with President Reagan at different times, including being replaced as the chairman, after he clashed with Reagan's chief of staff Donald Rumsfeld and defense secretary Cap Weinberger (who subsequently served in the same role under the younger Bush). Jones was also out of favor with Carter for his reluctance to take the rescue mission forward, and he reportedly had to accept the job in Weinberger's Defense Department as Chief of Staff after his plan to retire was disrupted by his wife's terminal illness.

Jones is described as quiet and unassuming, but also as tough and stubborn, with a strong sense of fairness. He was reportedly able to be very blunt with the president, without losing their respect.

The mother of missing teenage girl Charlene Downes has criticised “horrible” social media trolls who have targeted the man leading the investigation into her 10-year-old murder case.

Charlene vanished after a night out in 2003, her naked mutilated body may have been disposed of by gangs who groomed her and she could have been turned into so-called “kebab meat”, detectives believe.

Karen Downes, 48, from Blackpool, said the public response to the re-opening of the murder investigation had been “absolutely fantastic”, but she condemned the taunts being posted on Facebook and on The Bolton News website.

Talk on the webboards: Hundreds of posts on The Bolton News website have been made about the Charlene Downes case

Charlotte Downes, 14, went missing from her home on 13th January 2003, in Blackpool. Her body was never found and on 6th November 2013 an inquest ruled that her death was “unlawful killing”, 13 years after her disappearance.

On 14th January 2016, Lancashire Police set up a hotline for anyone with information about her.

On 15th January 2016, a woman came forward and told police that Charlotte had been murdered and the gang in question had chopped her body into small pieces and fed them around Blackpool in kebabs. (see story)

On 4th February 2016, police said they could not rule out that Charlotte's body could have been fed to homeless people as kebabs, but that this claim was from information that has come from another source. (see story)

As of 27th April 2016, the police have no suspects.

But Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy told reporters that the vote was not ""compatible with the Spanish constitution"". Hundreds of thousands of Catalans joined a protest in Barcelona recently, calling for their right to vote. Unhappy at Spain's refusal to give Catalans more powers, protesters have been energised by Scotland's recent independence referendum, and many also waved the Scottish flag.

  I am having trouble making some sense of this. In order to make a self portrait, a Martian robot would have to be able to detect itself, take care in pointing in the right direction and taking it, and then send the picture back here - as a picture is a set of data packets rather than an actual object.

  The human robot Mars rovers have cameras built into them so that they can take pictures of wherever and whatever they land on as well as transmit those pictures to Earth.

  So, in order for me to take a self portrait, I would have to be able not only to pose just right, I would have to be able to use some sort of camera to take the picture and then some way to send it to NASA. So I don’t even think this robot is capable of this, and I am pretty sure that any sentient beings on Mars that would be able in some way to take these pics would not be that interested in posing to send a pic to some place out of their home universe to the Earth.

Summary/Thesis: “This week the Associated Press revealed a new U.S. cyberattack against Iran as part of its “long-running effort to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program,” adding a new facet to the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran.

The computer, which is part of the plant’s safety system, was destroyed in such a way that U.S. officials could then prove Iran had shut off the safety mechanism when attempting to enrich uranium.”  Not surprisingly, the Trump administration denies involvement in any recent attacks against Iran, but the AP cites cybersecurity experts who say the malware points to U.S. fingerprints"

Article: Venezuelan authorities have arrested two suspects accused of shooting U.S. officials in a strip club earlier this year.

Prosecutors charged Carlos Mejias Blanco and Windy Fabiani Mejias with attempted murder, alleging that they got into a fight with two U.S. embassy officials at the club and opened fire, ""leaving them wounded,"" Venezuela's Information Ministry said in a statement Tuesday.

Police said the May shooting occurred in the early morning hours at the Antonella 2012 club, located in the basement of a mall in northeast Caracas. Mall security said the establishment is a strip club.

In May, the U.S. State Department said two members of the embassy suffered non-life-threatening injuries but did not provide details. The injured officials worked with the embassy's defense liaison office, according to two U.S. officials who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation.

Background: Venezuelan-U.S. relations have been rocky"

What's wrong with it? 1, the first sentence, there are words. The two underlined are weak because it is redundant in the sentence . 2, the second half of sentence 2, `` It is really sunny'' is a fragment because it has no subject after the word ``when.'' 3, sentence 3 is a fragment because there's no complete verb after ``. This '' . What makes this wrong is the verb ``is'' is not an independent verb form, it should be ``make'' 4, sentence 4 is too long. According to the requirements for this essay, each sentence should be about 20 words. You should use fewer words to better describe your idea. In this sentence ``Making me really happy'' is kind of complicated because it's saying you like summer here (Making me really happy) but it's kind of saying it in a long way.

Girl Scouts' membership drops 6 percent

``` ""

For the second straight year, youth and adult membership in the Girl Scouts has dropped sharply, intensifying pressure on the 102-year-old youth organization to find ways of reversing the trend.
   According to figures provided to The Associated Press, the total of youth members and adult volunteers dropped by 6 percent over the past year — from 2,994,844 to 2,813,997. Over two years, total membership is down 11.6 percent, and it has fallen 27 percent from a peak of more than 3.8 million in 2003.
   While the Girl Scouts of the USA have had an array of recent internal difficulties — including rifts over programming and serious fiscal problems — CEO Anna Maria Chavez attributed the membership drop primarily to broader societal factors that have affected many youth-serving organizations.

Coventry have one of the oldest League One squads and the average age of the forwards is a whopping 30 years, a good five years over average. That is not going to be improved by losing Clarke.
And if the rumours are correct and he has a deal with Brighton on the table, the Sky Blues will look to sell now, if the price is right.

The Bishop of Blackburn dedicated a memorial garden at Wainwright Way

The skeletal remains of an estimated 1,967 people including 800 children were unearthed during work to build a road in Blackburn.

The bodies were discovered in January during work to build the Freckleton Street link road.

A service led by the Bishop of Blackburn to mark the reburial of the remains has been held in the town.

An estimated 1,700 remains were reburied at Wainwright Garden of Remembrance last year.

Four months of excavations uncovered 489 adults, 1,077 children and four babies at the now disused burial site, which once served a church called St Peter's.

About 200 bodies were not buried because of poor condition of the bone.

The discovery sparked fears that the remains of up to 2,000 people were buried at the site, where there were only six burials on an official list, but officials believe between 1,00"

Then when comparing this type of star with other stars it is found that the temperature is much hotter than a star would be, and so it rules out a star. Then there is the luminosity. When considering a star as the source of the object, it would have to be quite close to the solar system, otherwise it would not have been detected. Since it is in the visible area it is likely to be on the same plane with the solar system and hence probably be close. The luminosity of the object is such that the closest star to it would be on the order of a light year away, which is quite small (if this is the distance in reality which is not likely to be the case). In the case of a planet it is highly implausible, although still possible, that the surface would be hot enough to give off such an intense light.

GPs in England already keep a register of patients with learning disabilities, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence thinks patients with autism should be easily identified by health care professionals too. NICE says a register - which would be anonymous outside a patient's surgery - would help staff to adapt their approach to suit patients' needs. For example, doctors might need to take time to explain information clearly, nurses could vaccinate children at quieter times of the day, and surgeries could turn down lights for those with sensory problems.

But they can also be creative and artistic thinkers.
And a lot of people are undiagnosed - a survey of young adults estimated that just 6% of those diagnosed had been so from childhood.
Adults with autism are less likely than others to receive an annual health check and treatment for long-term conditions, says the government.
In England, this NHS screening programme for adults at greatest risk is currently aimed at people with learning disabilities.
That register is based on primary care data, and updated by people with learning disabilities and/or autism when they see health and care professionals.

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for nearly 1 of every 4 deaths according to the National Cancer Institute. Because of advances in research and in medicine, however, more people now live longer after they are diagnosed with cancer. More advances continue to be made and offer promise of better treatments in the future.

The number of women who died from cancer and other diseases in the U.S. has increased since 2008, with cancer deaths rising by 1.5%, according to a 2015 annual report on cancer. About 585,390 cancer deaths are expected this year according to the report, which was co-released on Sept"
81666,1,"Detection of cancer is often possible only by means of specialized tests and instruments. The early symptoms of cancer are so general and nonspecific that they may be mistaken for signs of other diseases. Cancer may be difficult to treat and is often life-threatening; it is caused by out-of-control cell growth. The uncontrolled growth of cells leads to the destruction of healthy neighboring tissue. Cancer is usually detected by some imaging procedure (such as X-ray examinations or computed tomography scans) or by biopsy. Depending on the type and the severity of the cancer, the growth of the cancerous tissue can be slowed or halted by chemotherapy. Sometimes, particularly with skin cancers, simple excision of the growth is the best treatment. Occasionally, when the growth is extremely small, killing it with heat (cryosurgery) or destroying it with a high-energy beam (radiotherapy) is an option. Cancer can sometimes be completely cured with surgery to remove the cancerous growth. In some forms of cancer, such as leukemia, chemotherapy is the main approach to therapy. A combination of surgery to remove the immediate danger of the cancer and chemotherapy is"

43672,2,"A trade deal is the ultimate outcome of diplomacy and trade negotiation between two or more states or blocs. Typically, each side is looking to reduce the tariffs and duties, increase market access and achieve a balance of trade where more imports from the other side are exported to the domestic market. A trade negotiation will likely only commence once there is a strong appetite to do so, for instance when there is a mutual understanding by both sides that a new trade regime will be in their interest. This may be triggered in the event of a perceived threat in the short to mid-term that an existing trade relationship will be disrupted as a result of one or more of the following: · a trade dispute, typically a long-standing issue that has yet to reach a resolution · a significant change in government or government policy · the failure to complete a multilateral trade agreement with several or all WTO-member states · an escalation in the ongoing trade wars/tariff conflicts.

So I started an appeal on GoFundMe and within three days it was reported to Facebook's Trust and Safety team and GoFundMe pulled the plug on it. In response I have now set up a GofundMe page for my dog, the reason being that they do not yet have a Trust and Safety policy for mental health.

A couple of things here...

1) Is it a one punch KILLING or death? Killing = the person or persons doing the killing are/is guilty of pre-meditated murder in which they have knowingly chosen to kill the victim which is indefinitely different to accidental 1 punch 'murder' in which one person did not intend to kill or seriously harm someone, ie, it was accidental...

2) It makes me wonder what punishment Mark Donnelly would have got had he been convicted on manslaughter charges.

(AP) — Marlon Samuels was unbanned by the International Cricket Council on Friday, with the off-spinning batsman cleared to resume bowling in international cricket.

The ICC approved Samuels' bowling action after testing at Loughborough University earlier this month showed his elbow extension was within the permitted 15-degrees limit. Samuels said he made big changes to his game during a training session with a Sri Lankan spin bowling coach in South Africa to fix his action.

""This has been a very difficult few years, especially trying to convince myself I could get my action back,"" Samuels said. ""But this was my main aim when I resumed bowling in the domestic competition ... to clear my name.

""I have tried many remedies to regain my bowling action, but it was very hard. I'm happy that the hard work has finally paid off and"

16712,3,"I guess the question is what would be the best way that the police can use to prevent these groups from gathering and doing further damage? AFAIK , in the 1980' I was involved with several protests that didn't seem to get the police attention. Even though there were some serious incidents that required police assistance. I think that the main concern of the police was to keep this from spreading to other locations and keeping order in general . So with the EDL taking a stand at the Woolwich site a good location choice to get lots of media attention I say that police presence will be low but close and will allow them (EDL) to do as they wish as long as they don't disturb the peace (not causing serious damage, like setting a fire) . It's up to the EDL to keep their members in check or deal with them quickly if they run amok. If it wasn't for the EDL I see the same scenes (as in the picture above) going on at other sites as well I guess . If they'd only go to jail then it would be easy to solve.

    In the first hour after marijuana legalization, authorities handed out just three $100 tickets... for public consumption.

Marijuana is finally legal for recreational use in Colorado starting at 12:01 AM today (January 1), prompting a flurry of sales across the state.

Authorities have warned that marijuana use in public remains illegal, and at least three adults so far have been stopped for smoking in the open.

Denver Mayor Michael Hancock also warned that a public  party planned for today had been cancelled.

Police plan to use a no-tolerance policy on public consumption of cannabis, meaning the tickets handed out at midnight have been for low-level offenses according to a spokesperson.

'The intent is to make people aware that just as alcohol there is a time and place for [marijuana] consumption,' the spokesperson said.

    In Denver the consumption of pot in public will go from an infraction (worth only $100) to a misdemeanor that carries a six-month jail sentence and a more than $900 fine.

The 1986 amendments to the act specifically stated that hospitals are required to stabilize patients who come in as a result of drug overdoses or alcohol poisoning, or are suffering from mental illness. In many cases, these patients receive painkillers, even as the law states that, “There shall be no treatment of patients in the emergency department or stabilization unit for mental health conditions.” That’s why many people come to the ER. The emergency room is the go-to for anyone who needs immediate help, no matter how serious the problem. But there’s also a downside to the emergency room.

##### The New Summary of Article Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been frozen in the public mind by four images. There's the surveillance photo that the FBI says shows him carrying a backpack among the people who thronged the finish line of last year's Boston Marathon -- a backpack that federal agents say held one of the bombs that killed three people and maimed more than 200, severing limbs from many of them. There's the one of a blood-smeared Tsarnaev staggering from beneath a tarp on a trailered boat as a small army of law enforcement holds him in its sights. That ended the pursuit that began when the FBI handed out the first picture. Then there's the gauzy image of a placid, tousle-haired teenager that appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone three months later. That one sparked outrage among many of the survivors and prompted numerous outlets to pull the issue, which featured a lengthy profile of the suspect. And there's the one from his last public appearance -- a sketch of Tsarnaev in an orange jumpsuit standing"

23027,3,"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's defense case has been built upon the argument that Tsarnaev was controlled by his older brother, Tamerlan, who died in a confrontation with police following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.
Tsarnaev's defense, led by Judy Clarke, has maintained that Tsarnaev is not guilty and should be treated as a juvenile whose age and the influence of his family played a major role in the decisions he made.
Tsarnaev's defense team has made this case from the outset, arguing the younger of the two brothers wasn't at all like his older sibling.
They have focused largely on Tsarnaev's life in high school, telling the jury he was something of a ""good kid.""
But the defense has failed to move the jury.
It might not be possible to convince the jury to not think of Tsarnaev as a terrorist, as 45 minutes of television are about Tsarnaev, and the jury will never know any of the detail given at trial.
There are still some jurors who have not been convinced of the defense's argument.

A 24-year-old Russian citizen is facing deportation next week after enrolling in a high school in Pennsylvania under a pseudonym.

Artur Samarin was arrested in February for having sex with a minor, but now faces the additional charge of having used a false identity to gain entry to the Harrisburg School District.

His visa expired in 2012 and he faces deportation on July 27 under a name he provided to the Department of Homeland Security to gain a work permit.

Samarin reportedly faced no consequences due to a legal loophole regarding a state law known as the Tierney amendment, which requires school districts to deny enrolment to foreigners.

But since Harrisburg School District was closed, it did not have to adhere to the statute, according to the Patriot-News.

The newspaper said Samarin was a very active member of the district who was even involved in its food banks and cadet programmes.

The Denver Post reports the study by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found about one out of every eight Colorado residents older than 12 had used marijuana in the past month. Only Rhode Island topped Colorado in the percentage of residents who reported using pot as often, according to the study. The study averaged state-specific data over two-year periods. It found that, for the 2011-2012 period, 10.4 percent of Colorado residents 12 and older said they had used pot in the month before being surveyed. That number jumped to 12.7 percent in the 2012-2013 data. That means about 530,000 people in Colorado use marijuana at least once a month, according to the results. Nationally, about 7.4 percent of people 12 and older reported monthly marijuana use. That's an increase of about 4 percent. In Washington state, which also legalized marijuana use and limited possession for adults, monthly pot use rose about"
70065,3,"[...] The results [...] shows that while a few states have high prevalences of past-month marijuana use, only Colorado had significantly increased prevalence from 2011 to 2013. This increase is driven largely by residents of Denver, Colorado. In addition to increased prevalence of past-month marijuana use, the survey also finds significant increases in use disorder-related indicators.

The study by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that during 2011-2012 about one out of every eight Colorado residents older than 12 had used marijuana in the past month.

The poll win puts an unpopular, lame-duck coalition government in the history books and has ensured that the LDP will take back the seats of power. The LDP was seen as the natural party of government after its near 50-year stranglehold on power was loosened by scandals and a slow economy, but it was still unpopular at the start of the election campaign. The BBC Asia editor Rupert Wingfield-Hayes says the LDP's victory is a major boost for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is seen as a hawkish, right-of-centre leader who has led his party to an almost unbroken run of success in national elections, including eight general elections since 1955.
```"
82151,1,"` The LDP, which enjoyed almost 50 years of unbroken rule until 2009, is projected to have an overall majority in the new parliament.
Mr Abe has already served a Japan's Prime Minister between 2006 and 2007.
He campaigned on a pledge to end 20 years of economic stagnation and to direct a more assertive foreign policy at a time of tensions with China.
He is seen as a hawkish, right-of-centre leader whose previous term in office ended ignominiously amid falling popularity and a resignation on grounds of ill health.
But Japanese media project big gains for his LDP who they say are on course to win between 275 to 310 seats in the 480-member house.
Its ally, the small New Komeito party, looks set to win about 30 seats to possibly give the alliance a two-thirds majority in the lower house.
That would give Mr Abe the power to over-rule parliament's upper house and help to break a deadlock that some say has plagued the world's third biggest"

DOWNLOAD LANDMARK PAPERS AS A SINGLE PDF LANDMARK PAPERS (EBOOK) On a clear, warm and sunny Saturday afternoon in August of 1913 at 3:30 pm, a tremendous bolt of lightning struck the second floor balcony of the Hotel Biron in New Bern, North Carolina. The lightning struck the top support beam, just above the doorway from the stairwell, burned a hole in the floor approximately one foot wide in length (from where it had entered the structure) and several inches deep. The beam was split down its length by the electricity. This lightning strike in 1913 is important to our landmark papers because what happened next has not been documented in the scientific literature. This bolt of lightning started a chain reaction of events that included people suffering from a variety of medical symptoms. Many of these people believed that they were suffering from “electric shock,” even though they did not receive a direct electrical shock. What they"

ExoMars will be assembled at the Airbus space facility at Stevenage, UK. And it will be launched by a Proton-MT from Baikkouran, Russia. The launching time is scheduled for Nov 15, 2016. This is considered as a challenging mission, and will be the

The man also called the cops to his home to report a fire which was a set up by him. He also declared secession from the country. The police were aware of the trap and kept themselves away from harm’s way. He attempted to enter the house, but he faced refusal from the nanny. The nanny took a child to a safe place in the home. Finally, the police officers entered the area and took the man into custody. Leguin took the child and placed an explosive device on the child but police officers saved him before he came across any harm.

PUBLISHED: . 16:28 EST, 27 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:28 EST, 27 March 2012 . Shock waves from comets bombarding the Earth may have helped to build proteins and set the stage for life, scientists have learned[1].

Comets, giant snowballs of ice and dust, are known to have carried organic chemicals and water to the early Earth[2].

But just what caused life to spring out of nowhere on a barren and desolate planet billions of years ago remains a mystery[3][4].

Rock on: It's thought that comets were responsible for kick-starting life on Earth

Now scientists may have part of the answer[5][6][7].

Laboratory experiments have shown that amino acids - organic molecules that are the building blocks of proteins - would have survived violent comet impacts[8].

What is more, the shock of a large comet impact would have provided the energy needed"
48723,1,"A team of scientists recently found that the organic molecules which are the building blocks of life can survive impacts by large meteors and comets, providing the energy and the water needed to start bonding amino acids together and creating proteins. Proteins provide the raw material that allows all living things, from microbes to humans, to exist and function. Their creation by comets may explain how life appeared so quickly at the end of a period 3.8 billion years ago called the ‘late heavy bombardment’. Dr Jennifer Blank, who led the U.S. scientists from the Nasa/Ames Research Centre in Moffett Field, California, said: ‘Our research shows that the building blocks of life could, indeed, have remained intact despite the tremendous shock wave and other violent conditions in a comet impact. ‘Comets really would have been the ideal packages for delivering ingredients for the chemical evolution thought to have resulted in life. We like the comet delivery scenario because it includes all of the ingredients for life - amino acids, water and energy.’ Dr Blank described the experiments at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Diego, California. https://phys.org/news/2012"

48723,3,"Amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, could survive large comet impacts, researchers are claiming. They said this showed how life could have began on Earth. Nasa had found signs of the impact of comets around 3.8 billion years ago. They believed this created proteins as a result of the impact. But they weren't sure if those amino acids would survive the aftermath. Research was able to simulate a comet impact by firing a projectile into a box full of silicon carbide - a solid like sand. They could then monitor the amino acids present in the box - by using a technique called vibrational spectroscopy - for two weeks before and after the impact to see whether it damaged them. The data showed that the amino acids survived the impacts but were transformed into other forms. So they concluded that a comet impact was likely to be the cause of proteins on Earth.```

13502,1,"The latest installment in the global scramble for economic influence in Asia was played out Friday in Tokyo, where a Chinese delegation led by Vice President Li Yuanchao met, in a friendly fashion, with new prime minister Shinzo Abe, who was elected on a campaign to reverse Japan's downward political and economic spiral.

China's recent diplomatic charm offensive in Asia is aimed at extending the economic and political influence Beijing already enjoys in the region and strengthening its influence against that of the United States. It should be noted that as part of his economic diplomacy campaign in the region, Li, who is the fourth ranking member of China's government, met earlier in the week with the prime ministers of Pakistan and Mongolia.

Mr. Abe, a conservative nationalist and unabashed admirer of the economic model of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, who returned to the prime minister's office this week after first holding the post in 2006, is a strong supporter of the United States. He appears to welcome a greater American profile in Asia, not as a counter to China's rise but as an enabler. In his 30"

China on Friday criticised Mr Abe after the Washington Post published an interview quoting him as saying Beijing had a ""deeply ingrained"" need to challenge its neighbours over territory. Japanese officials said the quote was ""misleading"" and Mr Abe had not said China sought conflicts with other countries. Mr Abe came to Washington seeking to erase a perceived ambivalence about Japan's relations with the US that was created by the previous centre-left government, which Mr Abe's Liberal Democratic party defeated in national elections in December. Japan has swapped prime ministers six times since Mr Abe first held the office in a short.

  The Department

  This is the story of the biggest case of British corporate criminal negligence of our time, and how the guilty ones got away with it: HBoS was the biggest British bank failure, and Andy Hornby was the chief executive who presided over its demise. But for reasons the British public may never understand, and which go into its DNA, he got away with it. Hornby and his two ex-chiefs, Sir James Crosby and Lord Stevenson, were not even referred to the Serious Fraud Office to begin a criminal prosecution, although the case for that was made. Even an official enquiry that spanned three years and cost £26 million has not called for their head. I think this has been a systemic failure and has revealed the weakness of one of most important institutions. The UK is seen as a beacon of probity and transparency in the world, and for good reason. But when it comes to corporate criminal negligence, and when the banksters have friends in high places, the system just hasn't worked.

51732,3,"In a world of increasing complexity, our financial system must ensure the efficient allocation of ever-dwindling resources to their most effective and ethical uses. This requires a healthy, honest, transparent and trusted financial system, one that serves the needs of businesses, investors and consumers alike. At the same time this system must be robust enough that its failure will not inflict catastrophic damage on our economies.   When the financial system is operating correctly, it performs many essential functions in a modern society and is a vital tool for improving the prosperity of its citizens. This is possible because of the essential roles it plays in allocating, measuring and monitoring the distribution of capital, risk and information.   But when it is not operating correctly, the financial system performs a wholly different role: it impoverishes those on fixed incomes, including the elderly; it wastes capital that could have been invested in new jobs or productive infrastructure; and it diverts economic opportunity to groups such as the corrupt and organised criminals who manipulate the system for self-enrichment or for their own purposes.   In the worst of cases, it can also subvert or destroy the moral fabric of a wider society, as has been seen in recent years; these"

  Africa's cultural legacy is everywhere in Brazil. The cultural elements began with the roughly four million slaves who were brought to Brazil over a 300 year period. Brazil was the last to abolish slavery in 1888.   Brazil now has the most famous carnival in the world, attracting an estimated 1.1 million visitors to the city this year and with 5.3 million people taking part in the street parties. Carnival is celebrated across Brazil. Carnival combines samba - music and dance which grew out of Brazil's black neighborhoods - and the Catholic tradition of celebrating the run-up to Lent brought by Portuguese colonialists.

There was more to it than that - such as what it was carrying.
2) Yes, Roscosmos has made improvements. They have had to since the last Progress vehicle made a spectacular collision with MIR. No-one has died in that incident, though.

33271,3,"----------------------------------------------------------------------- John Terry stripped of England captaincy after FA's probe into his alleged racism on the pitch A panel including former English striker Les Ferdinand decided the decision over stripping John Terry of his England captaincy should be left to Fabio Capello. But the FA confirmed, along with the decision to strip Terry of the armband, that the Chelsea defender was told the decision was final. Terry, 31, was stripped of the captaincy pending his trial in July over alleged racial abuse of Queens Park Rangers' Anton Ferdinand. The 31-year-old, who appeared in court again this week, had said he was ""surprised"" that he had been stripped of the captaincy. He and the FA are embroiled in a legal dispute over the matter, with the 31-year-old claiming his suspension was unlawful and a breach of contract. On Monday, the FA said it had taken its action to allow football to ""focus on playing and coaching"". Mr Capello, his coaching staff and the FA will now focus on preparations for next summer's European Championship in Poland and the Ukraine. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ```"

Gareth Thomas, human resources director at Arriva Trains Wales (ATW), said: ""We are disappointed that train driver union members have rejected the current offer of increased pay and improved terms and conditions by supporting a ballot for industrial action.

The 11 things every adult should know about dating a single mother.

The things you think you know about dating a single mother are probably untrue so let’s discuss some of the issues that come up when you add a mother into the equation. If dating her mother doesn't scare you away, you two are definitely a match because that is just how she gets it on.

Suddenly after years of no romance, you become a part of the picture and this is something that will not be easily forgotten. In fact, if you want to make this a lasting relationship, you need to remember those days when you had no one—no one but your mom, who will be there by your side when you're down and out.

This means a lot when you're just starting out with her mother and if there are any problems between you two, she will be there to help you out."

The Seahawks were down for most of the game, and it looked as if they would not make the next Superbowl, after they had made it last year. However, in the last quarter and in overtime, the Seahawks were able to capitalized on the Packers mistakes. This win made it the fourth final game the Seahawks have ever played at home, with the previous three being Super Bowl appearances. Seattle's record is 4-0 for championship games that they have played at home, with the last two of these four being Superbowl appearances. The Seahawks are now going to the Superbowl for the second year in a row, and it will be played in Phoenix, Arizona on Sunday February 1, 2015. ```"

   The Seattle Seahawks, bidding to become the first team in a decade to win back-to-back Super Bowls, will now play the New England Patriots after they hammered the Indianapolis Colts. Trailing 19-7 the Seahawks scored 15 points in 44 seconds late in the fourth quarter - Wilson and Marshawn Lynch each powering their way into the end zone for touchdowns and adding a two-point conversion to surge ahead 22-19.

72810,3,"Russell Wilson hit Jermaine Kearse with a 35-yard touchdown pass in overtime , putting Seattle Seahawks past  Green Bay Packers (28-22) and on to Super Bowl appearance. In what had been a funeral atmosphere much of the game as the Seahawks looked headed to an end of their reign , with the score just 12-19 coming into the last six minutes, Wilson , who had misfired most of the day, flashed champion pedigree with a 35-yard touchdown pass to Jermaine Kearse  to put Seattle in front with less than two minutes left. At that point, Seattle had scored 15 points in 44 seconds , but they still had 35 seconds left to the Green Bay with the home crowd going into overtime stunned. The drama was far from over , as the Packers' Mason Crosby booted his fifth field goal of the day to send the game into OT. The contest had been billed as one of the best matchups this season, and certainly lived up to that hype, with some clutch plays from two champions that will meet each other again in Super Bowl XLIX"

When customs officials in Sydney scanned the parcel, they found instead five pythons and two venomous tarantulas. On Tuesday, authorities raided the house in Sydney to which the parcel had been addressed. Officials seized evidence but expect to file charges later, the customs agency said. Importing live animals without a permit is illegal in Australia and can yield a 10-year prison sentence and a fine of 110,000 Australian dollars ($92,000 U.S.). The parcel was sent from the United States last week, but officials would not say specifically where it had been mailed from. The snakes were wrapped within white calico bags and the spiders were packed in clear plastic containers, the customs agency said. The creatures were later killed because they posed a quarantine risk, the agency said in a press release. It typed the press release: ""Spiders and snakes on a plane."".

### Fact:

- The UK’s population has grown considerably since 1990 ( 15.4 million ). Much of the increase has been due to immigration ( 3.9 million ) and to natural growth due to births exceeding deaths ( 4.6 million ).
- Immigration continues to add to population growth – of every six babies born in the UK, one is to an immigrant mother.
- England’s population increased by more than 2.5 million during the 20 years from 1991 to 2011 , with 91 per cent of new residents born abroad ."

27271,3,"Lampard's loan is due to expire on January 1st, which means he is technically now a ""free agent"" in the Premier League.

 As per Premier League rules he must either re-sign as a free agent, or sign as a transfer with his old club, who must then either accept a loan return or pay a transfer fee. As a result of a disagreement between New York and MLS as to whether or not Lampard is allowed to go back to Manchester City for the rest of the season, and between New York and Manchester City on the terms of any loan agreement, Lampard is currently not a member of ANY club.

 Lampard is currently in the MLS as per his current contract, but is not permitted to travel internationally for MLS business.

 New York are prepared to sign Lampard back as a free agent and have said in the media they will work on an agreement for a loan back to Manchester City, provided his contract is negotiated out.

 Manchester City have no formal agreement with their sister club, but the two clubs have agreed a ""gentlemen's agreement"" to make him a Manchester City player starting on January 1st."

- Do not make your thesis statement the last paragraph
- Don’t use the passive voice: “An experiment on the effects of cold in 1960 by scientists at …” vs. “Scientists at the U. of X demonstrated the effect of cold in an experiment in 1960.”
- Avoid contractions (i.e. don’t vs. do not), unless they clearly refer to the past
- Avoid unnecessary words, long sentences and clauses (i.e. one dependent clause can be replaced by a shorter phrase, using a verb and a gerund)
- Avoid long quotes (3-4 lines in normal text)"

65325,3,"Suez Crisis Background Winston Churchill had sent in troops to seize the canal in 1956, when Egypt nationalized the Suez canal. He did this, he said, to prevent the Soviets from ""playing the Egyptian card"". The American reaction was quick and unambiguous: ""We condemn any aggressive and unauthorised intervention by our allies into the affairs of a sovereign state."" They suspended arms supplies to France and Britain as a result. The French President took Britain aside and told them that if they did not give in to the US and pull out then they would be ""unworthy of our friendship"" This time the American response was muted - but they made it clear that they would not provide any help. The war was halted within five days as the Soviets threatened to intervene on Egypt's behalf. It was an extraordinary outcome: the two big colonial powers had been brought to their knees by the USA and one of their former colonies. Implications The Suez crisis was the biggest diplomatic embarrassment in British history. But it did at least provide an opportunity: for a change in the way that Britain saw the world - in more than fifty years Britain had lost just about every territory it once"
65325,4,"Britain and America were at each other's side for the duration of the Second World War, but in the decades that followed, things became more complicated. The US had become the 'indispensable nation'.  Washington had been frustrated at the British - and their European allies - attempts to undermine the emerging rapprochement between France and Germany. By 1952, the White House was already getting a headache.

  All of this came to a head with the Suez crisis, which would mark the end of Britain's imperial influence."

79728,1,"There’s a new paper in the field of computational social science that is attracting all sorts of attention: “Social Structure as a Cause of the Great Depression.” That’s great. The research is of sufficient quality that it has sparked an intense dialogue around how best to think about the role of social networks in explaining economic outcomes. While the paper is highly empirical, with a new approach to measuring network structure with a detailed micro data set (from a 1937 survey of American farmers called the 17), and with some sophisticated econometric technique, the paper is also quite conceptual and theoretical. So, it’s a great model (and a great discussion). But, as a friend told me, if you want to write a paper in this area – which is my research area as well as my academic and personal interests – you are essentially required to read this paper.

China is North Korea's main trading partner, and the only country that is allowed to have a diplomatic mission in the capital, Pyongyang. China is North Korea's most important ally, a fact that complicates efforts to bring Kim Jong-in to the negotiating table. The two countries have been at odds for some time, over nuclear weapons, North Korea's human rights record and Chinese claims over the disputed island of Senkaku, where Japan says China's fishing boats have encroached on the waters controlled by Japan.

It would look to increase the amount of bottle plastics which were being recycled. The initiative will be run by Zero Waste Scotland. Coca-Cola told BBC Scotland previously it was keen to see how the system might work in Scotland. An industry spokeswoman said: ""The Scottish Government is looking very seriously at ways the drinks industry can support its plans to tackle the litter.

        Half the fun of Halloween is coming up with new, creative outfits that will blow your friends' minds and maybe scare a few impressionable children. (The other half, obviously, is candy.) Technology can help. Take, for example, that classic Halloween accessory, the realistic festering wound.

Put your iOS or Android smartphone in a special fleshy case, add a carefully bloodied, ripped T-shirt and you have The iWound. There is also a moving eyeball outfit and a new effect that makes it look like a hand is ripping out your guts from behind. Rober first got the idea for mixing Halloween and smartphones in 2011

The decision has been widely criticised as unnecessary and potentially insulting to Cornish people, in light of Cornwall's already-secure protections of their culture.
The announcement has been widely seen as a gesture to the Liberal Democrat members of the coalition government, with the designation being announced by a Lib Dem minister and appearing to satisfy one of Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg's stated desires.
As the two coalition parties continue to clash over policies, it is becoming increasingly clear that the Liberal Democrats are placing a high priority on maintaining a large degree of autonomy from conservatives.

Rescuers were forced to wait until the building was declared safe before they carried out their search, but they later found parts of the building had collapsed on to the ground.

Susan Norman has been declared missing after a building where she lived collapsed after heavy flooding in Looe, Cornwall .

The building, located in Sandplace Road, collapsed late on Easter Sunday due to flooding in the West Country town.

  This is the first major clash between the US and Russia since Trump took office

  The claim comes as the first meeting between NATO and US Defence Secretary James Mattis and Nato allies will discuss the allegations and how to respond

  A similar missile violation allegation was made during the Obama era

  The US claims the Russian cruise missiles are new and therefore violate the terms of the Intermediate range nuclear treaty which is designed to remove nuclear capability from Europe

## Analysis: The big winners are the losers

- It's a poor result for the Conservatives. David Cameron's failure to give a pledge to renegotiate membership of the EU in full and put it to the British people resulted in them missing out on UKIP's vote. That said, Nigel Farage and UKIP's support remains patchy - they failed to challenge the status quo in London due to the London-list system and did not top either of the North East or the South East regions. The Conservatives won a convincing victory in the South East, with 16.9% of the vote, meaning they are in a strong position to challenge UKIP in any by-election.
- It's a bad result for the Labour party. UKIP's vote split the Labour vote, in some areas more than 50%. The party will have been disappointed with Scotland, where they came a distant third. The party"

When my daughter was born 10 years ago, I started blogging.
 I found that writing helped me remember all the cute things she did.

 I had a few friends and family who would read my posts, but other than that, it seemed like hardly anyone knew about my blog.
 A few months ago, a friend introduced me to the concept of social media.
 I quickly jumped on the bandwagon and started using Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Pinterest.

The spokesman said, ""The ambulance involved was carrying out a routine patient transfer – and so was not travelling with blue lights or sirens as these were not needed for the patient on-board. ''There were no injuries to the ambulance patient or crew, but we would urge any witnesses to the collision to contact the police to help with their investigation,"" he added. The police and paramedics arrived at the scene after the incident, which took place just before 6pm.

Japanese auction fish buyer pushes record to $1.76 m
Sun Jan 9, 2011 9:03pm EST
TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese sushi restaurant chain owner paid $1.76 million for a large bluefin tuna at Tokyo's Tsukiji fish market, smashing the previous record by nearly $1 million in his third consecutive bidding triumph at the annual sales spree.
Kiyoshi Kimura, who runs over 40 Sushi Zanmai outlets, made the winning bid of 155.4 million yen ($1.76 million) for a 222-kg (486-pound) tuna at the opening auction at Tsukiji early on Monday morning.
The previous record was set at the same auction by Kimura at $882,000 in 2010 and his top price in 2009 was $733,000, a spokesman for the fish market said.

A man whose son was killed at a school in Newtown, Connecticut has filed a lawsuit against the retail chain Walmart for selling guns that were used by Adam Lanza (the deranged student) to gun down 27 people last year . The lawsuit claims that Walmart knew that the guns it was selling to the man who shot them were going to be used on mass killings, but it knowingly chose not to do anything about it. This is the best thing that ever happened to Walmart. It is the best thing ever to have happened to a company. I am not against guns, but I do not believe they are good for anyone. I strongly believe that the U.S. Government needs to get guns out of schools.

96582,4,"The Argentine Dictatorship: An In-Depth Analysis

The Argentine Dictatorship, or ""Proceso"", lasted from 1976 to 1983 and marks a dark period in the country's history. During this time, state repression and human rights violations were widespread, resulting in the disappearance of an estimated 30,000 people.

The Proceso was led by a junta of military leaders, who seized power in a coup d'état in 1976. They maintained control of the government until democracy was restored in 1983. During the dictatorship, the military took a hardline approach to political dissent, carrying out extrajudicial killings, torture, and disappearances of left-wing activists, trade unionists, and other political opponents.

One of the worst examples of human rights abuses during the Argentine Dictatorship was the clandestine detention center known as ""El Vesubio."" This facility was a former mental health center that was converted into a prison and torture chamber. Hundreds of people were held and tortured there, and many were never"

Article: A two-year study of 92 different countries found that people living in regions with greater income inequality were less trustworthy than those living in less unequal countries, according to a study in Psychological Science.
Across the world, wealthy people often view less wealthy people with suspicion and resentment. This feeling is called ""structural anger"" and may be driving inequality up.
Structural anger is associated with higher levels of greed, resentment and discrimination among high-income earners, says lead researcher Sam Sommers, assistant professor of social psychology at Tufts University. People with this mindset have more negative feelings about others. When these negative feelings are directed towards the less wealthy, they may vote for politicians and laws that support policies to protect the wealthy, he says.

Made from bronze, the almost 2-metre tall statue was created by sculptor Robert Rattray and cost about $250,000. The money to finance its creation came from residents of Windsor with a further portion of the funds raised from the Queen and the Duke of Edinborough's charitable trusts. Since the Queen came to the throne in 1952, she's had various horses drawn her carriages throughout her reign at events such as Trooping the Colour and Royal Ascot. The statue was unveiled to celebrate her long reign.

SUMMARY -
A homophobic attack in Manchester's LGBTQ+ district over the weekend has led to the death of a 20 year-old man after ""receiving a serious head injury"".
Two other men, both aged in their teens, were also hospitalized in a stable condition. This came after a series of attacks in Canal Street, Manchester's LGBTQ+ district, involving more than one victim, over the weekend of July 11th and 12th.
The Manchester Pride Foundation has responded to the tragedy, saying that we are “devastated by the tragic news”.
“Our thoughts and condolences go out to the victim’s friends and family who are devastated by this news,” said Samantha Manns, Manchester Pride's co-chair.

The detailed report says that, despite the complex water flow system installed, one of the aerial watertowers failed while fighting the fire. The firefighting operations had to adapt, and the fire was brought under control by 7.00 am. The Superbowl was a modern complex which had won many national awards for excellence in operation and construction. Its size was large, and despite many fire fighting appliance pumps and water towers, and firefighting operations taking place over several hours, the fire did considerable damage. We may learn much about what went wrong, and how operations might have been improved and lessons learnt. It is too early to give an opinion, but it would seem that the complexity of the firefighting operation was the main issue, as were the water towers, or lack of them in certain places.

82823,4,"summary : What you see here is two very different images of Jackie Kennedy that appeared on the cover of two separate issues of Life, a magazine that had been very enthusiastic about JFK but lost interest in Camelot after his death. The images represent two things. The first is a portrait of Jackie as a lady of the social and political elite with a special place in JFK's inner circle. The second is that same lady in a very casual moment, a lady who, as wife of one of the most powerful men in the world, has few reasons to smile and still manages to. I can't decide which I like best. As a photographer I really admire the first one for its composition, how it plays with the lines and contrasts. In the second one I find the composition a bit busy and I have a feeling it's more a reflection of what the magazine wanted at the time (a couple days after his assassination) than any actual portrait of Jackie. So I would definitely choose the first one. But I like the second one more, because it really does capture a smile you won't find anywhere else. I like both of them a lot.

In 1849 The Prince Regent of Piedmont commissioned a violin from an up - and - coming member of the Guarneri dynasty, the 22 - year - old Giuseppe Giovanni Battista Guarneri del Gesu.

65855,4,"The Prime Minister has called for parliament to debate voting at 16 after an internal poll found the 50% of Conservative supporters support extending the electoral franchise for the first time. According to the Prime Minister, the decision on whether or not to move to a 16-year-old electoral franchise is one for Parliament to decide. In the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, 18 to 24-year-olds voted 1.8%, twice that of over-75s. Labour's acting leader Harriet Harman has stated that the vote should be held after debate in Parliament. The current franchise consists of UK citizens over the age of 18 who are registered to vote, and those temporarily abroad (military members and other) are eligible to vote. The Prime Minister believes that extending the electoral franchise will help in the long-running argument against student votes being allowed in local elections. This would help to boost local government party support. This decision may not be made until a review of all the evidence is complete. The EU referendum date is likely to take place during June 2016."

The current therapies for HF management involve mainly long-term drug treatment or implantation of a mechanical device, such as a left-ventricular assist device. This review presents a new strategy for HF management: stem cell-based therapy.  Brief Report:  Clinical trials of stem cell-based therapy have demonstrated the efficacy of injecting exogenous stem cells into the myocardium to alleviate HF and to improve the cardiac function of patients.  Conclusion:  Stem cell-based therapy has the potential to replace existing therapeutics, improving prognosis in patients with chronic HF. ```

 She was a mother-of-three and a survivor of a brutal and horrific attack that was broadcast worldwide, who went on to help countless other women cope with their experiences.

 Clare, not her real name, her daughter was attacked in broad daylight in 2012. The offender has never been found. She said she saw her daughter go from being confident and happy to frightened and introverted.

 But they found Jill to be consistently supportive - which has led to her daughter changing her career choice to follow in her steps as an advocate for women who have been raped.

 Ms Saward did not hesitate when asked to help with the fund, the family say.

 She was instrumental in working to change the law which allowed victims to waive anonymity and help other cases.

About one in five households experience severe levels of financial hardship as a result of energy costs. People who own their homes are five times less likely to face this than people who are renting, while people on low incomes are twice as likely to experience this. The report, from the Fuel Poverty Advisory Group, also finds that people who rent are twice as likely to experience cold at home as a result of unaffordable energy costs compared to homeowners. Fuel poverty is where a household spends more than 14% of its pre-tax income on energy. More than 10% of British households are classed as fuel poor.

   BA will use the staffed planes to minimise flight cancellations and passenger disruption from Saturday.

   The 16-day strike was prompted by what Unite union calls BA's ""poverty pay"".

   The long-running industrial action concerns around 2,000 of the airline's mixed-fleet staff who, if they joined since 2010, fly short and long-haul routes mainly from Heathrow airport and earn less than cabin crew on earlier agreements.

   The airline has already cancelled a small number of flights from Heathrow and merged others, but the leasing deal with Qatar means BA will be able to get the vast majority of passengers to their destinations.

Unite also wanted the Civil Aviation Authority to recommend blocking the deal as it was said to break European Union regulations - but on Friday the union's general secretary, Len McCluskey, urged BA staff not to strike during the summer holidays. Unite had previously called off planned action at London’s Gatwick airport. It accused the airline of removing concessions and perks for staff that took part in previous strike action.

48150,3,"FFP has been part of UEFA’s agenda for several years and is the process of bringing the spending of clubs in-line with the income of a club. The concept was that teams should not live ‘beyond their means’ i.e. have income that is sufficient to fund their playing expenditure. This is something that had been enforced from an administration viewpoint. In my view this was needed, some clubs such as Portsmouth had over stretched and got into financial difficulties. However we must also remember that FFP was introduced in a more stable period economically. It is also worth noting that FFP is not new for UEFA it has been present for years in their youth teams competitions.   FFP was introduced for all UEFA clubs in 2012. Club’s first season’s results were used in 2011-2012 (referred to as the Break Even Point or BEP). The concept of FFP was that a Club’s BEP would provide sufficient money to cover their expenditure.

48150,4,"In a nutshell, Financial Fair Play (FFP) is a set of regulations, which the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) adopted in 2011, which restricts clubs' spending depending on their revenue and wage bill. FFP is part of UEFA's efforts to stop clubs overspending, and ensure that their books are in order. The policy was a response to the deep financial crisis suffered by clubs in Spain and England due to the financial crash of 2008-2009. When FFP was adopted in 2011 it was hoped the policy would help to bring an end to some of the financial irregularities which had become common place in some football clubs across Europe. Initially, a soft sanction period was in place, where clubs were penalised with a partial prohibition of the sale of club's players to a certain transfer window, depending on how much they were out of the profitability requirements. For the 2013-2014 season, UEFA tightened up the policy, bringing in the following sanctions for clubs who have breached FFP requirements: * €30 million fine and 1-year prohibition for sale in transfer market"

  ## What is the African Diaspora ?

  African diaspora, broadly, is defined by the African Union Commission as ""peoples of African origin living outside the continent, irrespective of their citizenship and nationality and who are willing to contribute to the development of the continent and the building of the African Union."" Globally, Africans in the diaspora are spread out across the continents. In North America, there are 39 million from the African Diaspora; 113 million in Latin America; 13.6 million in the Caribbean; and 3.5 million in Europe, the World Bank estimates. The African Diaspora is not a monolithic group.

  ## Economic impact of African Diaspora

  The economic impact of the African diaspora is vast. In 2020 alone, African diasporans sent in $88 billion in remittances home, according to the World Bank's latest diaspora remittance statistics. These transfers help stabilize livelihoods, maintain families, build communities and contribute"
58267,2,"A study with two simple questions asked respondents about the nature of their contact with Africa, the level of contact with people in Africa and the type of exchange. It concludes that although most diasporans have contact with their home country, not all are engaged in any form of civic engagement, and there is a clear disconnect in the degree of contact and the nature of that contact.

```

``` - Africans living in countries with fewer political and economic opportunities make greater efforts to stay connected to Africa.

```

 - Almost 60% of those living in Europe and 91% in North America visit Africa only on vacation.

```

 - Young, married respondents make a conscious effort to stay connected, although there is no significant difference across income levels.

```

 - Many diasporans are not involved in business, development, volunteer or any other form of engagement.

```

 - Those involved in business activities are more likely to be men.

 - Women respondents are more likely to be engaged with friends and families, volunteering and are younger than men.

During the Enlightenment, however, the focus switched to exploring causation. The Enlightenment brought with it more complex theories about society and humanity. Geography, then, was enriched with this new perspective, and the discipline started to investigate how and why things were as they were. [1]
The main geographers of this period were the philosophers and writers Montesquieu and Rousseau, who focused on the idea of society and how geography had shaped it. They, however, worked in an epoch where travel was very difficult and most geographical ideas and facts came solely from books. The worldviews of the ancient and medieval worlds were not really present during this period, at least not in a direct way. The philosophers thought that humans had always been present from the outset, and thus thought that the ancient world was always very human in its character. To some, the most important aspects of their thought were that societies were to have their ""roots"" in the climate in which they lived and the geographical characteristics of that area - ["

81360,0,"""The latest figures on the economic costs of unpaid care in Britain reveal more than £87bn is lost annually due to caring duties - £436 per week for each unpaid carer."" ``` [2015-06-20 Sat 01:35:25 PM] https://bbc.in/1K3Tc06"
81360,1,"The Age UK report says a failure by government to provide adequate social care has cost the economy £177 a week per carer. The figure, based on lost earnings and forgone taxes of more than 300,000 unpaid carers, is the latest in a series of reports highlighting the scale of unpaid care being provided in the UK. It equates to £9.1bn over the course of a year and makes a mockery of the prime minister's pledge that no-one under the age of 75, no matter how wealthy, can meet the cost of residential or care home fees. The government says its long-awaited white paper on social care is ""imminent"" and will include funding changes to ""transform care"". The report coincides with a new survey by the National Children's Bureau suggesting more than 200,000 children could be providing vital unpaid care for a family member or friend.

A figure calculated on lost earnings and forgone taxes of carers. It is a costly task for the carer. Forfeit of their day's work.

Article summary: It says an unfit care system means people often have to give up work to help the elderly or adult disabled. The figure was calculated on the lost earnings and forgone taxes of more than 300,000 unpaid carers.
The government says its long-awaited white paper on social care is ""imminent"" and will include funding changes to ""transform care"".
Michelle Mitchell, charity director general of Age UK said: ""For many people, caring for a loved one is second nature and they wouldn't have it any other way. But carers should never be forced to sacrifice their own financial security and wellbeing due to the lack of service provision and support from public services.
""Care cannot wait any longer - this is the government's last chance to get it right and set their political legacy for generations to come."" A Department of Health spokesman said: ""We agree that helping people to stay in work alongside caring not only helps carers' careers and family finances but is crucial for our workforce and economy.
""The government has committed to working together with the business community to help carers manage work and care.

The Welsh government has asked the Auditor General of Wales to review its anti-poverty programme Communities First

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-41282583"
83871,1,"Andrew Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives have called for the Welsh government to review the spending of its Communities First programme. He said salaries costs were high and too much money is going into offices and salaries instead of the project. He has asked for a review of the spendings to be done by the Auditor General for Wales or by the government itself. He also said that the Communities First programme is essential for the areas in Wales with the highest rates of child poverty, especially in the north-east. Merthyr Tydfil's Communities First Trust spent nearly £1.3m of its £1.5m budget between 2012-2015 on salaries, £41,000 on training and £347,000 on ""publicity and promotion"". Lesley Griffiths, the Communities Minister said that the program and its spendings are transparent, it is one of the most effective anti-poverty program in Wales, they monitor the program and there is financial audits as well. ```

The £30 million a year spend on Communities First continues to help transform the lives of hundreds of people, families and communities. “The programme provides a range of different services that seek to address a range of social issues such as poverty, isolation and the lack of access to good facilities and services. “The key to its success is the ability of a wide range of agencies and communities to work together in delivering the best outcomes for individuals and families in our most deprived communities.”  Wales Office Minister Guto Bebb MP, said: “Gurnos was one of the worst postcodes in Europe when the Communities First programme was brought in. “The latest figures show a major turnaround under this Conservative Government as one of the former areas was deemed no longer in need of the programme. “However in the Gurnos area in particular there are still issues that concern the local community and I will continue to work with the Gurnos Community Forum to address that.  ````"

Welsh Communities First programme spending
The Welsh government has spent more than £1.3m on Communities First in Merthyr Tydfil, according to Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who called for a review.
The Communities Minister defended the spending on the flagship programme but an investigation revealed a project spent most of its £1.5m budget on salaries over three years.
The 3Gs Development Trust spent £1.29m on staff and other costs over 2012-13 to 2014-15.
Mr Davies said salaries in the Welsh programme were ""disproportionate"" compared to similar initiatives in England.
He called for more detailed reporting so taxpayers could be assured money was being spent ""effectively and efficiently"".
The 3Gs Development Trust, based in Gurnos, Tydfil, served an additional 500 children and young people in its last year of funding (2014-15), according to its financial report.
It provided activities such as ""positive young people's groups"" such as after-school clubs and holiday clubs"

91843,1,"The main argument: The latest work, published last night in the journal Nature Medicine, may lead to bacterial treatments in which germs are intentionally fed to infants... Asthma rates have been rising for decades. One likely cause is that we are living in a sterile medicalised world in which our immune systems are developing differently from those of our Stone Age ancestors. The rise in obesity, autism and the decline of children playing in parks combined with the increase in CSection births and antibiotic use could help explain some of these worrying trends. The new research confirms that a diverse germ-rich environment has a positive effect on the immune systems of our babies, increasing their resistance to allergens, and thereby also reducing the likelihood of asthma and auto-immune diseases in later life. If we believe this argument is well supported, then we might look to change our practices with a view to increasing diversity, which in turn will increase resistance to auto-immune diseases. A small amount of the right diversity (bacteria) will help to protect our children from allergies and asthma, while a massive and randomised amount of anything (in vaccines) will likely cause harm.```

It is believed that the perpetrator was a member of a group known as the “E-Ajmani,” which is linked to a number of terrorist groups. He had previously been connected to a militant group in Syria. This was a frightening incident and it has highlighted what is happening in our societies.

## Health leaders plan to boost mental health care

Health leaders, including NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens and the Care Quality Commission's chief executive, have pledged to put mental health on the same footing as physical health.
Speaking at the launch of a mental health taskforce report commissioned by NHS England, Mr Stevens said: ""It matters for the NHS, of course, but it also matters crucially to each and every one of us.""
He said the NHS England's five-year plan would ""fully endorse the report and the measures it recommends"".
The health services taskforce report says an estimated three-quarters of people go without help.
The report says urgent improvements need to be made, and suggests better mental health care would save £8bn a year.
Around three-quarters of people with mental health problems receive no help at all.
Prime Minister David Cameron has said more needs to be done, committing £1bn extra a year by 2020.
The government says this will help treat more than a million people a year.
The funds from the £8.4bn a year"
93325,3,"Mental illness is a leading cause of disability and a major driver of inequality in this country. More people than ever - about 1 in 4 - say they have experienced a mental health problem at some point in their lives, but most get no help - only about 17% of those who have a problem go to the GP for help, or see a mental health specialist. Even for those with severe and disabling problems - the report says up to 20% of the population - they face a postcode lottery and a system that is more geared to crisis intervention rather than prevention and early intervention. The taskforce suggests that one in 20 people with mental health problems would have to die to reflect the disparity between their treatment and treatment of physical illnesses. As well as money, the report also focuses attention on the shortage of mental health staff - with only 244 more per each million of the population than in 2007/8. The report is the fulfilment of a commitment by the government - as outlined in the 2010 Coalition Agreement - to prioritise mental health care. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt has already called it ground-breaking - and a ""huge leap forward"

  What we know:

   • The play, written by Peter Morgan and directed by Stephen Daldry, depicts the meetings between the Queen and her Prime Ministers as both 'intimate' and 'explosive'.
   • It's the first time Tony Blair has been in the play.

  What is new:

   • The most controversial scene is when the Queen (played by Dame Helen Mirren) asks Tony Blair (not specified who) in a fraught private audience at Buckingham Palace to call off the planned 2003 Iraq invasion.
   • She argues that he should seek a diplomatic solution from the United Nations.
   • But with British forces poised to join the US in bombing and ground assaults the next day, he says ‘The right thing to do is to go in hard now.’

  What we know still:

   • Royal experts denounced a scene suggested the Queen had a negative view of the invasion.

67747,3,"I was just about to sit down for the evening.  An explosive scene as portrayed in a new play depicting meetings between The Queen and her Prime Ministers (including Winston Churchill and David Cameron) has attracted criticism.  Helen Mirren has won rave reviews as The Queen, and this is her first US engagement having been hugely successful in London.  The scene which has caused such controversy apparently places The Queen against Tony Blair and his plans for a war  in Iraq.  Blair states that such an action is what the people want.

  Royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams said that the scene is totally contrary to everything we know about The Queen's view of Iraq.  Also, the play seems to suggest that the invasion of Iraq never took place.  Another Royal expert, Peter Hunt denounced the play, and criticized the playwright Peter Morgan.  The play is a two act, 150 minute drama, and seems to be based on documents and interviews.  So far Morgan has resisted all criticism.  The play will open again in London, and then go on to New York in the Spring

Judge at High Court tells British woman she faces jail if she fails to obey court order over daughter's name

The Telegraph
Tue 21 Dec 2010 10:02 AM
The Daily Telegraph

A British mother is facing the prospect of spending Christmas behind bars over her daughter's name after a judge warned her that she would be jailed in the New Year.

The woman, who lives near Oxford, appeared before Judge Simon Oliver today at a hearing at Reading Crown Court.

She had been issued an order by Oxford county court last month, preventing her from calling her teenage schoolgirl daughter by her chosen nickname or from revealing any personal details about her.

Oxfordshire county council applied for her to be sent to prison for breaching the order.

But Judge Oliver adjourned the hearing until January 25th, with the consent of council lawyers, after the woman admitted she had been in contempt of court.

He expressed his concern that the 92-year-old judge hearing the original case had retired and that another judge was now presiding over the matter.

The Supreme Court had ruled earlier that parliament must be involved in the process of triggering Article 50, and initiating the UK's exit from the EU.

94842,1,"The first VR headsets were released earlier this year, and have already been selling in their thousands. The PS VR even outsold every other console on the market, during its first week of release in Japan.

Tech expert Mark Zuckerberg, who created the social media site Facebook and owns a VR company, thinks that Virtual Reality is: ""going to change the way we live and work and communicate in the future."" So, we asked four tech fans to put some of the best VR headsets through their paces, and find out what they think...

The Playstation VR is the most recent VR headset to hit the market, being released on the 13th October 2016. Although it is the cheapest of the four VR headsets we reviewed, you still have to have a Playstation4 console and a Playstation camera to play it, which can more than double the overall price!

94842,2,"Oculus Rift:
First of all Oculus Rift is a gaming console. You put on a helmet on your head and it blocks you out from the outside world, you can only see what is on the screen inside the helmet.
It does not cost much as it is around $300-500. The first thing you need for this console to work is a computer. This is quite a strong console and there are no games for it as there are no consoles or headsets.
It is quite good as it's a virtual reality gaming console. I would recommend it as it's a lot cheaper than a PlayStation [VR].```"
94842,3,"Although I enjoy playing games on the Playstation 4, I didnât expect to enjoy the VR gaming experience as much as I did.
After the initial slight headache (although not from using the headset, Iâd just had a very long day at work) I decided to try some of the games out.
The games are really fun and easy to use.
You simply need to press the home button on the right or the left of the headset to start a game mode.
Also, unlike the other headsets, because it uses infrared sensors and has the ability to create a three-dimensional spatial mapping of the environment around the player, there was no lag and it was incredibly easy to play.
It is a great headset because it has a lot of great games, and it isnât too expensive.
I really enjoyed my VR experience.```"

I don't think I'd buy any of them at the moment, to be honest. The cost is just too much, and I'm also quite scared of the idea of a headset like that. I'd maybe like to watch one - not play any games, because I feel dizzy and sick after long periods of time on my games console. But I don't think I'd play on it. It seems like a really good thing - it must have a lot of potential. But the amount of money you'd have to pay for it just to see it isn't worth it at the moment.

One must own that the idea of throwing bombs on Oxford Street is not a bad one, but, to my mind, for the present, it is more important to do as little harm to the public as possible.’  So began William Morris' love-hate relationship with the public.

Quirke's audio quality is awful. It's unbearable and makes listening to every line of dialogue a massive chore. After tuning in to the second episode, it sounds no better than the first. The show is already getting a reputation as being one of the BBC's greatest disasters, and I agree with the critics.

The incident left her struggling to find her voice, to which she said in a phone interview while she was still in the hospital, “I don’t have many words this morning.

He was caught after failing to deliver a car part to a police officer who ordered it from him online.   Sentencing him, Judge John Jenkins QC said he was a ""[I]nvi[E]terate fraudster who simply will not stop"".  Shortman must also pay £2,065 compensation to his 10 victims and £100 costs.  The court heard he had 17 previous convictions for 77 offences, many related to the online market place.  The judge said eight of his most recent offences - committed on eBay and a car parts website between May and December 2013 - were done while on bail and on licence.  He added: ""Terms of imprisonment have not deterred you, you have continued to act with deceit and manipulation.""

He added: 'The treatment of his victim was deplorable and totally unacceptable.' The judge described Hanif as a dangerous offender who had gone completely off the rails since coming to the UK from Bangladesh. 'These are acts a judge never likes to see,' he said.

The man was arrested after executing a warrant in a nearby property in Solihull. The RSPCA confirmed that a number of small-breed dogs had been removed.

Dogs are not domesticated wolves, but instead are descended from wild dogs (from wolves and jackals) and are still classified scientifically as Canis lupus. The term ""purebred"" has no clear definition, and is not supported by scientific evidence, and is therefore not based on any scientific principle.

Most babies die because of severe congenital anomalies, but many births do not involve complications. Deaths occurring after delivery are known as perinatal deaths, and 22% of these occur on the weekend.
Risks vary throughout pregnancy and the perinatal period and may reflect underlying diseases of mothers and babies, fetal abnormalities, pregnancy diseases and complications of labour or delivery; however, deaths also occur when problems of labour and/or delivery are not recognised and treated.
The aim was to review the pattern of perinatal mortality in the day and week when babies are born by exploring the weekly pattern of perinatal mortality in the UK and identifying factors linked to perinatal mortality.

The finding could have important implications for controversial decisions such as Diego Maradona s infamous 'Hand of God' goal - and for the upcoming 2022 W.

I. Introduction

According to the study of Brewer, 2012,  the referees have a serious impact in the decision making power of football match results. The study states that, the climatic conditions have a great influence on both the physical and mental state of the referees that make them incapable of doing so. According to this study, the referees physical and mental condition vary according to the change of the environmental conditions (Brewer, 2012). The performance of the decision making of referees, who are working in very hot conditions, is quite unlikely (Brewer, 2012). But, there is hardly any concern about the decision making power for those working in cold conditions because the weather is always cold in these circumstances, like in the Champions and Europa Leagues."

72653,2,"Study was to test referee and linesmans mental and physical performance under different conditions.

Referees and linesmen were tested after different training camps. Physical fitness, cognitive function and biochemical responses to temperature extremes.

Cold conditions impaired physical performance and cognitive function. But did not affect the decision making. Hot and cold conditions both lowered the testosterone level but increased cortisol levels. Cortisol levels did not differ in warm conditions from normal ones.

Cortisol might impair decision making but further investigation is necessary. More cortisol could be seen as fatigue on higher cognitive function.

In these conditions goal line technology would not be affected by decision quality but they might be affected by decision accuracy due to fatigue.``` .

41293,0,"Snow can have various colours.  ```  The long version is:   There's a little bit of snow out there, and while the majority of snow is white in colour, certain snowflakes can appear blue. Blue snow is caused by blue reflection and absorption, while red snow is caused by red reflection and absorption. Here are some cool photos of blue snow.  Snow color is mainly dependent on scattering of light. Snow takes on blue colors as the result of light scattering processes. While blue reflects best, red scatters most efficiently.  Snow, also known as white crystals, is an intricate solid material that forms in clouds or around aerosols ."
41293,1,"- Snow is a mixture of water suspended in tiny air pockets. - Water molecules are composed of an atom of oxygen attached to two atoms of hydrogen. - Hydrogen is diaphanous, meaning that it lets light pass through its molecules but alters its path. - The effect is such that as light hits the snow, it is scattered and refracted so that the colour of the snow at any one moment in time depends on the path the sunlight has taken. In some instances, the snow can appear red. This happens when the sunlight has entered snow, been scattered and reflected back by snow crystals. However, it is reflected back and out of the snow without having been further scattered.

Snow is an optical illusion.

## What color is snow?

Snow is basically a mixture of suspended water in many tiny air pockets.

Water molecules are composed of an atom of oxygen attached to two atoms of hydrogen.

Hydrogen is diaphanous, meaning that it lets light pass through its molecules but alters its path.

The effect is such that as light hits the snow, it is scattered and refracted so that the color of the snow at any one"
41293,2,"Several people have been killed in an avalanche in New Hampshire, the US on Wednesday. Officials who were at the scene said that the victims, most of them young women, had been skiing in the Mount Washington region ahead of an incoming storm. Mount Washington was already closed on Wednesday morning but ."
41293,3,"Snow is not white. It reflects most of all visible light that hits it, but all light is a mix of the wavelengths that give us the colors. At one time or another, the color of snow can range from red to blue. This is because light will reflect off of snow with different wavelengths. Red shows up because red bounces off of the snow while blue shows up because it is absorbed by the snow. This happens because the ice in the snow acts as an optically denser medium the deeper down it is. That is, ice is . .

  If one wants to view the snow as the white colour we think of when we think of snow, one needs to find the snow that has been at the top of the snowfall, which would not be blue. One needs to look at the snow as if it is the white colour we think of when we think of snow. The colour of the snow is what we see in the snow when the colour of the snow is in the snow. We cannot assume that the color of the snow is the same as the color of the light that is reflected from the blue of the sky. The sun itself is not red, and it is not the sun that gives us the white"
41293,4,"White snow was always my favorite color. I prefer a landscape that is so white it reminds me of a blank sheet of paper where I can write my future. Snow means Christmas and the Christmas means snow. My hometown in Japan has a lot of snowfalls from January throughout March. The longest snowfall in our village took seven weeks! That was the winter when I could see the snowy mountain for the first time, which is my favorite scenery and my best memory! ``` To answer why is snow is not white or blue sometimes: As we know that air is made of molecules, which bounce white light and reflect it and we see it as white. At a depth, snow begins to darken from scattering the white light from the surface . . So in the sunlight, all the light waves hit snow particles and scatter back out of it. Snow is white because all incoming light of all wavelengths is reflected back out towards the eye that receives the reflected light, and this gives snow its white appearance .

We can also compare it with the rainbow, where light passes through drops of water and separates into the colors of the spectrum. When white light falls on snow, it illuminates it, while a part of that"

- The basic concept of a resume is to tell the viewer what you have been doing in your last job. If you have never worked before, you need to start from the beginning. Put in the basic information that you want to include so the resume looks more appealing to the reader.
- If you have the proper education and previous experience, it is a good idea to get a job interview before your resume. This is an excellent opportunity for you to see whether you are being interviewed for a position that fits your skills or if you are not being considered for this particular position. If you are considering a position outside of the realm of your previous job experience, this is a good way for you to see if you would like to pursue the position, and if you think you are qualified.
- Do not include anything on your resume that is unrelated to your field, unless it is a hobby. People like to see a wide range of interests and skills, but they don't like to see everything.
- Be careful not to put too much personal information on your resume. There are laws against discrimination based on race,"

Another thing mentioned in the article is that if you use noise canceling earphones, or similar ones, you shouldn't wear them in public.

The author also mentions that if you are using your iPod in a public place and you see people staring at you because they are trying to figure out what you are listening to you should take out the earphones so they don't get mad and frustrated if you don't let them hear your music. People can get really angry if they don't understand what is going on around them.

26122,3,"I shot this picture on a cold, clear, sunny day in the Cairngorms. It's December so there was a good sprinkling of snow on the ground (as you can see!). The sun is high in the sky, meaning more than likely that the angle of the light is low which tends to make the hares' eyes 'pop' in photographs. This helps to highlight the subject of the picture and make it more interesting. I shot it on an Olympus OM-D EM1.

  The exposure was 700 ISO. 14mm. F/8. 1/400 Seconds (Hand held).

  The hare looked very cute with snow on its eyes & face. Even though it was in a good spot for an interesting photograph I am aware that photographing an animal in a zoo is not very 'wild' so always aim to avoid it if possible. However, this hare did look interesting so thought it an appropriate picture for the Wildlife Photographer of the Year awards.

Michael Piggin, from Loughborough, was accused of two counts of terrorism which included plans to attack his former school, a mosque and a cinema. The 18-year-old had previously pleaded guilty to possessing explosives. The prosecution confirmed there would be no retrial after the jury failed to reach a verdict after 11 days. During the trial at the Old Bailey prosecuting lawyer Max Hill QC said Piggin had plotted a ""Columbine-style massacre"" in the Leicestershire town. He showed weapons found in his bedroom and videos of the teenager making Neo-Nazi salutes and shouting 'EDL' outside a mosque.Following a raid at his home in Beaumont Road, Shelthorpe, police found several air rifles, component parts of pipe bombs, a crossbow and a swastika flag hung above his bed. Piggin, who was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome after his arrest in February last year, said"

In this retrial, Michael Piggin has been acquitted due to no more than being bullied in school. Apparently, the teen wanted revenge on those who bullied him. The teen had no terrorist intentions and there was no sign of his being a terrorist sympathizer.
  While it is understandable for a court to listen to all that happens in an individual's life, it is also understandable for the jury to consider if the teen is being influenced by propaganda and if he is a terrorist sympathizer.
  We all need to think about what is being reported and make sure that we do not end up taking the advice of terrorists ourselves. The teen has admitted to being influenced by terrorist propaganda, including the white supremacist ""Fourteen Word"" slogan.

67757,2,"Rarely can a garage have attracted so much interest.
For a while it might be the most expensive in Britain.

A ramshackle garage next to a south London industrial estate has become the most expensive ever to sell in Britain after going under the hammer for £550,000 in a 'frenzied' bidding war.

The brick-built former coach house, used for years to park the Mayor of Southwark's car, sold at auction for almost triple the guide price and £150,000 more than the average house in Camberwell.

The price paid for the 'empty shell' of a building by an anonymous buyer beat the previous record, held by a garage near Harrods in Knightsbridge, west London, by £25,000.

  The question is this: how can we, a nation with 300 million guns in the hands of civilians, address the problem of gun violence? First, consider our conceptual framework.
  Here's the thing: the debate over gun violence is being framed the wrong way. We tend to see it as a debate on gun control. If we can just limit access to guns, the argument goes, gun violence will be controlled. For example, we can make the purchase of a gun more onerous by mandating background checks. We can limit access by establishing waiting periods. We can keep guns out of the hands of people who are already dangerous. But this framing is wrong. We can't control gun violence by controlling weapons.

The election will take place over a 1-month period in March. If none of the candidates can win the majority of the vote, the top 2 candidates will meet in a run-off vote in April (1).
The election is expected to be particularly competitive, with up to 8 candidates considered potential front-runners (2).

This statement indicates that Shaw is so much . a wimp and a cry-baby that any game is very hard after Arsenal's loss. Even the FAQ at FAQ.com explains that ""When you are new to FAQ, it can be very hard to find answers at first"", but as Arsenal's loss was Shaw's only loss, I can understand how he'd found it so hard when he could not find answers, and hence that he was asking for the answers.

What is wrong with Shaw that he had to have this public revelation of this ""hard"" game! He could have been more diplomatic in saying that this loss has a deep impact on his mind and that he would try to improve in future games . ```

The system needs to be made simpler, more effective, fairer, more affordable, and should reward contribution. '

Presenting pensioners with a choice to receive their winter fuel payment could lead to hundreds of millions of pounds worth of savings, and is just one way to root out perceived unfairness. It says, 'limiting child benefit to the first four children would save up to £2 billion a year in the next Parliament. The authors suggest introducing a system of universal, non-means tested childcare for all working families with children under five years of age. These reforms would have the clear objective of getting more parents, especially those on low-incomes, back into employment…' It also calls for the Government to end the current rules limiting access to housing benefit to one or two bedrooms for households under the age of 35 in social"

The Scottish Parliament has given its backing to Gillian Martin’s Backbench Bill to make it a legal requirement for all Scottish minibuses and coaches, used exclusively for pupils, to have seat belts fitted.
The rural economy and connectivity committee welcomed the Bill and suggested the Bill be extended to cover buses used for school trips.
Just over half of Scotland’s councils have the requirement as part of their school transport contracts.

The committee highlighted that the Bill did not require that seatbelts were worn.
Labour MSP Neil Bibby said 74% of pupils at a school he visited said they were unlikely to wear, or would not wear, seat belts.

SNP MSP Stewart Stevenson said that requiring the fitting of seatbelts in school buses was something the Scottish Parliament could legislate for.
The law that would enforce wearing those seatbelts lay elsewhere.

Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles said he was “astonished” that this was not already a law and that all 32 local authorities had not specified this in their contracts.

They also discussed extending the scope of the legislation beyond home-to-school journeys and raising concerns over the lack of funding available to local authorities to ensure that seat belts are on school buses, and for more detailed evidence to be included in the Bill.

The Committee agreed that it was not possible to accept more amendments to the Bill. It agreed to ask the Scottish School Bus Association to write to the Committee with a view to supporting the Bill. The Committee agreed to seek technical advice on the issues of enforcement and funding.

## Twitter adds while-you-were-away feature to top timeline | ExtremeTech

Twitter is now going beyond the trending topics and introducing a new feature, called ""while-you-were-away,"" to the top of user's timelines.
The new feature doesn't require you to opt in, and seems to be rolling out globally, although users report having seen it as early as late last week.
We checked our account and saw that Twitter was surfacing a mixture of local and national news, and that our timeline was a mix of popular, retweeted, and trending topics.
The news update feature isn't brand new, though. It was tested last fall, with users getting a personalized mix of the 15 top stories that they might have missed between each checking session, but it was called ""timeline review"" then and was an opt-in feature.
It was tested, but ultimately never launched.

  # Alison Sharland v  Charles Sharland: Appeal to Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has given a wife permission to challenge the conclusion of her case at the Court of Appeal that she was not misled in an attempt to secure more money from her ex-husband in 2013.  Mrs Alison Sharland, who accepted £10.35m from AppSense founder Charles Sharland two years ago after their marriage of 17 years broke down will now go to Britain’s highest court.  Ms Sharland’s barrister Patrick Chamberlayne QC told the Court of Appeal: ""She was cheated into an agreement. If someone dupes you into a deal, why should you be held to a deal?  The £10.35m was a fraction of what her millionaire ex husband said the company was worth. His firm AppSense was later valued wildly higher, and his stake was said to be worth £150m in 2013.

He had told her the figure was set with reference to the amount he had received when his previous business was sold.

But Mr Sharland had not revealed at the time that his company was potentially about to embark on a major share issue, meaning the offer he had given her represented just 50 per cent of his possible worth.

Mr Sharland told the High Court earlier this year that he was worth nearly £150million.

Mr Sharland, 50, who was given permission to appeal by Lady Justice Arden, said his wife was aware of his continuing interest in AppSense and of the possibility of a further issue of shares in the future.

34006,1,"The Cochno Stone dates from the Neolithic and its rock art has the most complex, dense carvings of its kind found anywhere in Britain. It predates the mysterious Stonehenge complex by 1,5000 years, making it older than the pyramids of Egypt. The stone lies on a mound called Cochno Hill and is surrounded by Neolithic earthworks (some in the form of henge).
The Cochno hillfort is a large, flat topped, fortified enclosure, on a raised plateau in Duntocher Moor. It is one of Scotland’s largest hillforts, measuring almost 150m from side to side.
The first part of the archaeological work involves removing the approximately 2,000 tonnes of peat that had been covering the monument. This will take place from Wednesday-Sunday.

BANGKOK - January 6, 2009
Wealthy Germans are leaving their country en masse and have invested billions of euros in offshore tax havens in order to save themselves from new legislation that could cost them a lot, according to a report from German newspaper Bild.

One-fifth of all millionaires in Germany have put their assets into tax havens, a total estimated to be around 100 billion euros (£81 billion), the report said. Another ten to 15 percent are considering following suit to avoid what they expect to be the harshest tax reform in Germany's post-war history.

At the same time, the state coffers are in dire straits. The first estimates for the 2009 year-end deficit are likely to be considerably higher than the already disastrous 2.7% expected.

31446,4,"In this largely rural state, commonly known as ""MeckPomm"", strident messages about immigration might seem a little hollow. The state has taken in around 26,000 migrants since the current wave began in 2015. It is a small proportion of the estimated one million who arrived last year. Under a federal allocation system, Mecklenburg is expected to take in just 2.03% of all refugees. But this region of the former East Germany is also poor and thinly populated. Anti-immigrant rhetoric resonates. It is key to the AfD's success, a theme relentlessly highlighted in campaign literature and meetings with voters. At an AfD campaign stop in Grosse Klein, a poor suburb of Rostock with a higher than average concentration of immigrants, the subject of foreigners, particularly Muslims, dominated.

59529,1,"In 1991 Leibovitz had one of her most controversial photographs, of a very pregnant Demi Moore in Vanity Fair. The iconic shot was used in a 1991 Vanity Fair cover, the magazine's most successful. But the nudity and graphic imagery caused quite a furor. Vanity Fair was accused of overdoing it and glorifying pornography. Leibovitz was criticized for her artistic integrity and Moore was chided, unfairly, for being insensitive to women and girls. Criticism also came from medical groups like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other women's organizations. ``` We should have a heading for each section of the article.

59529,2,"Annie Leibovitz, who has photographed everyone from the Rolling Stones to Queen Elizabeth II, is being sued by Art Capital Group if she does not pay a $24 million loan by Tuesday. Her famous portrait of Demi Moore pregnant is one of the most famous pictures used by her throughout her long career. In 2013, she took a $24 million loan with the company in exchange for rights to her art, intellectual property and real estate, agreeing to sell those assets to repay the loan. Art Capital Group says she ""refuse to cooperate in the sale of those assets"" and ""refuse to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars she owed as part of the same agreement."" The contract states she would make profits to repay the loan by selling her fine art, intellectual property and real estate assets, with Art Capital acting as agent. They have until October 1 to respond to the lawsuit, who has not commented as yet. In 1991, Leibovitz photographed a nude pregnant Yoko Ono in bed with John Lennon for Rolling Stone Magazine, not her first controversy with nude pictures and one of her most famous pictures.   ```"

She authorized Art Capital to act as agent in the sale of those assets through which Art Capital could recoup its decrease in interest rate. She would have realized a significant gain from that sale."" One of Leibovitz's best known photos is of John Lennon with his wife, Yoko Ono, shortly before the Beatles star was assassinated in 1980. She is no stranger to controversy. In 1991, Leibovitz photographed a nude and extremely pregnant Demi Moore, which landed Leibovitz as well as the magazine Rolling Stone, which published the shoot, in court.

## What happened during the criminal investigation at the European Level?

We should be clear on what is the most important question to be answered in this blog post. The answer is simple, and it is just a matter of applying the criminal law, or in other words, to follow the basic steps of a criminal investigation, which is to be:

## What happened in the Czech Republic?

We should remember that it is not about the Czech Republic being responsible for the crime or not.
The point is:

## What was the difference between Poland and the Czech Republic regarding criminal responsibility of the suspects?

This is the main question, which requires further research.
But there is an answer to this.
The main difference between the two countries in terms of criminal law is that the Czech Republic has no legal framework for handling extradition cases.
This means, that the Czech Republic did not have any procedures to deal with this type of case, and thus it will be up to the European Parliament to decide whether or not to ratify European Arrest Warrant.
European Arrest Warrant is the key tool for making sure that criminals cannot hide in Europe anymore.

It was Hearts who were first reduced to 10 men when Igor Rossi was sent off just before half-time. He saw red for a two-footed tackle, while another heavy foul saw Hamilton's Jesus Garcia Tena dismissed in the second-half. Hamilton will have valued the point, though, with Hearts hitting the woodwork three times. The game began as a test of Hamilton's character, since the players could still have been emotionally bruised by their 8-1 loss to Celtic in midweek.  There was a natural retreat into being briskly and forcefully competitive. Martin Canning sent his side out in a 3-4-3 shape, to ensure there was cover in defence against Hearts' front two, but formation was secondary to attitude. Pressure was applied swiftly and vigorously to any Hearts player on the ball and the opening half seldom raised itself above a general level of scrappy endeavour.

## How to start private browsing

With Incognito Mode, your activity won't be saved to your browser's history, so anyone who uses your computer later won't see the websites you've been browsing. Incognito also blocks your Chrome browser from saving cookies when you close your incognito window.

## Incognito Mode doesn't hide you from everything

Keep in mind that your online activity is still visible to websites you visit, your employer, or your school, and a total stranger sitting next to you on the train can see your activity on their screen as well. Also, some websites save certain information, like your IP address, so a forensic expert might be able to determine what sites you've visited.

Police will use specialist interviewers to speak to school children in South Auckland who witnessed one of their peers being stabbed by another student.

Police said the 11-year-old boy remains in a stable condition with a head injury in a children's ward at Auckland's Starship Hospital.

Details of how he was hurt have yet to be released by police, but it is understood he was stabbed with a pair of scissors by a boy of a similar age during a fight at his school on Tuesday.

Police and Child, Youth and Family staff will speak with the child today, and officers have begun speaking with other schoolchildren who witnessed the fight.

The interviewers will be used because police say it is important to keep the children properly informed as there is ""potential"" for serious interviewing work to support investigations.

They say it is important the interviewers ensure they provide the children with a comfortable environment conducive to sharing information.

It is collected on the last weekend of April to allow people on different patterns of pay, e.g. teachers in different months of the year, to be included. The pay gap is calculated by taking the median male earnings of the earnings in the survey (50% above; 50% below) and subtracting the median female earnings. The ONS says that a smaller gap of difference between the numbers of men and women with high earnings doesn't necessarily mean less of a gap in pay, other factors can be a factor. This might include men and women having different jobs, or working different hours. Pay data for part-time and full-time workers shows that part-time workers have a lower median hourly earnings than full-time workers. The pay gap is much lower for part-time workers than full-time workers"

### Usain Bolt Is A Genius Troll Who Doesnt Have To Be Respected

Article: By . Emily Crane . Usain Bolt is not a complex individual. The six-time Olympic champion and nine-time World Champion is a very talented athlete, one of the best in history, and that's why we love him. We're not looking for any more from Bolt. We don't need to see his life off the track, or know what he thinks about anything. We love and admire him for excelling at what he does – the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay. But as we've seen on occasions, Bolt is willing to engage with the media and give them an interview when they do the same, so we can get some insight. As he was one of the biggest stars on show in Glasgow, Bolt had to be brought in front of the microphones to give his analysis of the competition, and some journalists took that opportunity to ask the most ridiculous"

Mosquirix vaccine safe and effective against deadly childhood disease
Medicine and health: malaria

The European Medicines Agency gave a positive scientific opinion after assessing its safety and effectiveness.
It represents a 'green light' for the Mosquirix jab, developed by GlaxoSmithKline.
The World Health Organization will consider later this year whether to recommend it for children, among whom trials have yielded mixed results.
Malaria kills around 584,000 people a year worldwide, most of them children under five in sub-Saharan Africa.
Mosquirix, otherwise known as the RTS,S vaccine, is the first against a parasitic infection in humans.
Dr Ripley Ballou, head of research at GSK vaccines, said: ""This is a hugely significant moment. I've been working on this vaccine for 30 years and this is a dream come true.""
The company has not revealed the price of the vaccine, but has pledged not to make a profit from it.
It has been designed specifically to combat malaria infection in children in Africa and will not be licensed for travellers.

They said the new rapid test can offer results within just one hour. The device - the size of a USB stick - can detect bacteria directly from urine samples four times more quickly than traditional methods. The findings were unveiled at a medical conference in San Diego. There was a need to move beyond the current ""carpet-bombing"" approach to treating urinary tract infections (UTIs), Professor David Livermore, from the University of East Anglia's Norwich Medical School, said. He said the way to do so ""lies in accelerating laboratory investigation, so that treatment can be refined earlier, benefitting the patient, who gets an effective antibiotic, and society, whose diminishing stock of antibiotics is better managed.""

A common problem with urinary tract infections (UTIs) is that doctors often have to ""carpet bomb"" patients with antibiotics because they don't have all the necessary test results beforehand.
The Norwich Research Park team developed the test to improve the diagnosis of UTIs.
They say the device is four times faster than traditional methods, as well as considerably cheaper and simpler.
It could be used in the community, as well as in the lab.
Prof David Livermore, from the University of East Anglia, says:
""It is very encouraging to see this new approach to test urine for UTIs in less than an hour.
""In the short term, it would be valuable in reducing the number of patients who receive unnecessary antibiotics, thereby reducing the risk of resistance and encouraging a new generation to enter medical professions.

It is now believed Elomar died in an air strike, but convicted terrorist Sharrouf may have survived. The two men came to public attention last year after they posted pictures of severed heads in Syria on social media. Some of those photos showed Sharrouf’s seven-year-old son holding up the severed head of a Syrian soldier. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said last week the government was close to verifying Elomar’s death. However, on Sunday she said security and intelligence agencies were working to verify reports that Sharrouf had survived the coalition air strike “which is believed to have killed Mohamed Elomar”, reported Nine News. The two Australian men had travelled to Syria and then Iraq in 2013 to fight with IS. Local media on Monday reported Elomar was recently killed by a drone strike but his friend was not killed.

# Bio

Born on July 10, 1921, in Brookline, Massachusetts, Shriver was the fifth of nine children to Joseph P. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. She emerged from the long shadow of siblings John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy as the founder of the Special Olympics, which started as a summer day camp in her backyard in 1962. Today, 3.1 million people with mental disabilities participate in 228 programs in 170 nations, according to the Special Olympics.

``She was the light of our lives, a mother, wife, grandmother, sister and aunt who taught us by example and with passion what it means to live a faith-driven life of love and service to others,'' the Shriver family said Tuesday in a statement. ``For each of us, she often seemed to stop time itself.''

- Kristina is the first woman to be re-elected as president in the Americas and the second in history. She is the widow of her predecessor, Nestor Kirchner, who led to victory in the last election but died of a heart attack last October 27. She was re-elected with 54% of the votes. In his victory speech after winning a second four-year term over her closest rival with a wide margin, the President warned of austerity measures on the horizon.

GDP is usually estimated on an annual and quarterly basis. Yearly growth rates that exceed 3% are often viewed as being healthy and supportive of job creation and income advances; some economists, such as Thomas J. Sargent, however, argue that the rate is lower than it would be absent the economic distortions brought on by government intervention. Quarterly growth data are highly variable; many macroeconomic indicators, such as the purchasing manager indices, are considered by many investors and economists to be leading economic indicators. A large variety of goods and services are included in the measurements, most notably: Consumer expenditures on services (e.g., transportation) and goods (e.g., clothing). Business expenditures on residential and non-residential construction. The price of imports minus the price of exports (a factor for globalization).

Separately, there is a vacuum which sucks up all the toast crumbs and accumulated dust. Arguably, the new £249.99 device is the biggest innovation since Sir James Dyson first launched his bagless vacuum cleaners 20 years ago. Importantly, it taps in to the growing desire among householders for cordless machines, which are not tied up in a cat's cradle of cables. The Dyson Hard also serves as an alternative to plug-in steam mops, which have become enormously popular for cleaning hard floors in the past two years. Again, the new device has the advantage that it is more convenient. There are no power cables, no water tank to fill or delay while it heats up.

The statistics will show that either Falcao and Van Persie have been on the scoresheet in all three games they have started together . Indeed, Van Persie's first of the season at Leicester was presented to him on a plate by Falcao's far post cross . Radamel Falcao leaves the field to an ovation fit for a hero, Radamel Falcao has his first goal for Manchester United and it proved to be decisive in clinching victory over Everton at Old Trafford . It also obscured the fact that a player who could end up costing United in excess of £50million had squandered a number of opportunities to get off"
92570,4,"Radamel Falcao's first Manchester United goal in Monday's 1-0 win over Everton may not have come out of the blue, but in truth it was a big surprise. The 28-year-old striker, who is on a season-long loan deal from Monaco, arrived at Old Trafford having ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament in January and his performances for his new club so far have been underwhelming. He missed much of pre-season with a knock and, having started the season on the bench, came on as a substitute in the previous two Premier League matches before being asked to start against the Toffees. While the £43 million signing will feel that his first goal for United was a long time coming, it was not a particularly eye-catching one as it came thanks to a fortuitous deflection straight off the foot of John St"

The majority of the election results have been posted for some time on the council's website, but as yet there is no mention of councillor Willie Young - SNP, Bridge of Don - losing his seat. There is a mention in the newspaper that this was due to ""coverage of the so-called 'Wallgate' scandal"" but we suspect there may have been a rather tetchy reaction among members of the Independent Group should the outcome of the forthcoming local elections in May 2017 have any effect on that group's representation on the council.

For some people, pets form intimate parts of families and social units in the same way that other family members do. As the pet matures, the bond between it and its owner becomes stronger in a similar way to the relationship between parent and child. So much so, that, for some people, the loss of their pets can be devastating. Yet this grief, and the sadness that accompanies loss, may not be given the same credence as the grief a person feels in losing other human beings in their lives.

The 24-year-old singer is to face trial later this year for allegedly conspiring to supply a journalist – known as “Fake Sheikh” Mazher Mahmood – with cocaine.

The N-Dubz star is accused of telling a Sun on Sunday reporter that she could help him procure drugs during an “undercover” meeting at a recording studio in London on 25 May.

She was said to have put the fake sheikh in touch with a man called Mike Coombs, and it is claimed that they met at the Dorchester Hotel in London, where Coombs is claimed to have given her £860 from a bag containing 13.9g of cocaine."

  H.P., and J.R. Levinson in their article of the same name that appeared in _Behavioral and Brain Sciences_ in 1982. But as a warm-up, I want to provide a brief sketch of the fuzzy-set model itself, focusing on its basic formal features. I will then argue that Levinson's claims concerning the psychological status of fuzzy sets are not nearly as clear as they are portrayed. More seriously, I will question whether the fuzzy-set model really offers an adequate explanation of the nature of vagueness. The fuzzy-set model is a formalized version of the Sorites paradox [Levinson 1980]. A _fuzzy system_[Levinson 1992] consists of three elements: the members of a set, the membership grade of each member, and the function that assigns membership grades to members. Here is a formalization of the Sorites using the fuzzy-set model. Start the system with the statement that a snowball is fuzzy. This means that"

Alan Mullery was once the best young player in the country. But when he started working for ITV as a pundit for their 1970 World Cup show, Brian Barwick got something of a surprise.

Six years earlier Alan Mullery was the undoubted 'Wizzkid' of European soccer.

As one of the top talents of all time at Chelsea FC and as captain of the England youth side, the future looked very bright for Alan. Indeed as a youngster his natural maturity and grace had attracted glowing praise from Pele’s former coach, Victor Paganini, who labelled Mullery as the most outstanding, well-distributed player in the world.

In November 1964 at the age of 20, Mullery became the youngest captain of an England side when the Under-23 team faced Czechoslovakia at"

26259,3,"A New York State institution is looking to end a tradition that most colleges consider as a rite of passage. Following a rise in hazing at Binghamton University, administrators have banned recruiting a new class of pledges - students that would be hazed to test their strength before being accepted into their desired fraternity or sorority. The action came after a year in which students were forced to eat vomit omelets and run over beds of rocks as part of the initiation. The situation prompted Binghamton to take the radical action. “When Binghamton University suspends initiation, you have an institution that is in deep trouble,” said Dr Jeff Victoroff, a professor at the University of Southern California and a member of a non-profit organization that is in the process of being formed to reduce hazing, and to educate students about the dangers and realities of hazing by creating an online awareness campaign. “As these young students arrive, in some ways they do not realize the dangers they are getting themselves into. They are going off on these wild stories without understanding the consequences of hazing activities, not just on themselves, but on their fellow students.” One hazing victim at Syracuse University said"

Why: The reasons for fraternity hazing can't be so simply stated.  To be part of the group, to go to parties or other events (like rush week), or it can be a way for leaders to weed out individuals from the group.  In the end all forms of hazing are dangerous.

51963,2,"A Barclays manager has been jailed for stealing thousands of pounds from an elderly millionaire’s account in the hope the customer would not notice the money was missing. Shaikh Khan, who handled hundreds of Premier accounts for a London branch’s wealthiest customers, stole £10,000 from Jack Mautner – described as ‘particularly old and vulnerable’ – who had over £1million in his Barclays account. After taking the money, the 26-year-old manager tampered with Mr Mautner’s account details to ensure he was not sent a statement and alerted to the missing cash. Deceit: Barclays manager Shaikh Khan handled hundreds of Premier accounts for wealthy customers. Khan, who worked in a Barclays branch on Oxford Street, also stole a further £10,000 from another customer, Lilia Vasilieva, who did not regularly check her account.

Details/contents:

Thierry Henry's New York Red Bulls side do not require him to return to the United States until March and, with Gervinho and Marouane Chamakh away on Africa Cup of Nations duty, Wenger knows his squad is already light in the striking department.

Wenger, though, confirmed that he has not yet spoken to Henry about a possible deal for the former Gunner to return to the club in the second half of the season.

""We did not discuss that. There is a possibility because Henry can go on loan. Why not? I am open-minded to anything good that can help the team. But nothing concrete,"" said Wenger after his side's 3-1 victory at Queens Park Rangers.

The World Cup semi final is tonight, Brazil vs Germany, and the two teams have decided to make all the fans and the world take a look at their shin pads. And it’s pretty awesome. Mats Hummels, German team player, is wearing shin pads with his favorite pattern. That is the BVB logo. And Miroslav Klose, a German striker, has chosen to have his kids photos on his shin pads.  Manuel Neuer, Germany’s goalkeeper, also has his favorite and neat colors and patterns on his shin pads. Also, the defender, Hulk, chose his parents and one of the most memorable moments in his love life over the World Cup. A cute and brave Brazil defender Dante is wearing all green shin pads – which is an obvious nod to the colors of his team. .

5312,0,``Mary Beard wondered about the meaning of the lyrics.'````
5312,1,"Mary Beard wrote about how she was struck by the phrase ""no crib for a bed"" as she perused the lyrics printed in her order of service.

Professor Beard said of the printed lyrics: 'It did make you reflect on what made a good carol, what was the right blend of sentimentality and jolliness. It also made you reflect on how weird some of the words were (what actually does ""no crib for a bed"" mean?),' she added.

```
The confusion is thought to arise from the fact that - at least in Britain - a crib and a manger are essentially the same thing; a trough from which an animal can eat fodder. But in the U.S., where the carol was first published in Philadelphia in 1885, a crib is defined as a small bed for infants and young children.

The main argument/summary in plain text, avoiding URLs and lists is :
```"
5312,2,"Away, in a manger, no crib for a bed The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head The stars in the sky looked down where He lay The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay The cattle are lowing, The poor ones moaning,
  ```"
5312,3,"Professor Mary Beard, a Cambridge university professor, attended a carol service in a Cambridge church where she noticed that the familiar words of Away In a Manger were a bit off. The lines go, ""the little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes"", and ""His mother Mary meek and mild in a manger laid lowly for her Child"". ""What do these mean?"" she wonders, ""Manger = trough from which an animal can eat fodder. 'No crib for a bed' seems particularly weird - you wouldn't expect to read it in John Clare or a Victorian hymnal. Is this just the kind of sentimentality that the poet wrote, for children?""

```
   She offers a quote of the last verse which has another bit of a clash in terms or religious symbolism: ""Haste, haste to bring me savior or we shall die. Mary wrote down all these things and treasured them and pondered them in her heart."" For many scholars, the lyrics are not just weird, they're heretical in their meaning.

```
   In the first quote,  the little lord Jesus could be viewed as a mockery"
5312,4,"In 200 words, the summary in plain text the who, what, where, when, why, avoiding URLs or lists, is the article in which language written, and its title. Keywords that are highlighted. ```

The reader's reply continued: 'So while the baby in question may have been placed, wrapped in swaddling clothes, in a manger, as the first verse tells us, it probably didn't have the manger itself as a bed. 'Rather, after the manger was cleared of its fodder (for, after all, mangers were designed for animal fodder), it became the baby's bed. 'So then, ""crib"" really should be translated ""bed"", perhaps, but with the meaning of a tiny, child-sized bed.' If, however, 'crib' denotes more specifically a child's cot, as in the U.S., it would appear that 'no crib for a bed' means that, for the first few hours or days of his life, the infant Jesus did not have a bed - just a manger.

The judge threw out the conviction after a key prosecution witness said a former FBI agent had coached him on what to say at a crucial lineup.

The Liverpool Evening Echo reports: The Grand National is Britain’s most popular race and was first held in 1839. In recent years it has been blighted by controversy as the sport struggles to maintain its integrity. A number of equine fatalities in the Grand National have caused concern. Last year 12 horses had to be put down on the course as the death toll rose to over 100 horses over the past decade. In November the British Horseracing Authority commissioned an enquiry to identify ways to reduce the number of ‘fallers’ in Grand National. Liverpool City Council today insisted the race will continue in Aintree as they signed a 27-year deal with the owners in October last year. Councillor Paul Brant, Liverpool City Council’s Cabinet member for culture and tourism, said: ‘This is a fantastic day for Liverpool. ‘The Grand National will stay in Liverpool and it’s great for"

Around 11 a.m. on Wednesday, Joe Cornell was watering plants outside the Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Center in Fresno where he lives. At the same time a Brinks armored truck headed toward him. On the way to pick up cash from the local grocery store, he said the truck abruptly stopped. He couldn't really see what happened though, and the truck took off as usual.

Curious about what had happened, Joe decided to check for himself. So he walked up to the intersection where the truck had stopped, and saw cash all over the sidewalk.

Joe, a recovering meth addict who is still fighting the urge to use again, had seen it all before. He could have taken the cash, but decided not to. Instead he called a neighbor who works for the bank, to tell him what he had found. The neighbor said they'd come to the scene to pick it up, so Joe waited.

The banker asked Joe if he needed money"

57489,1,"Arizona spent two hours killing death row inmate Joseph Wood on 23 July 2014. This is unusually long for an execution. There are renewed concerns that executions are not as quick or painless as first thought. One of the key drugs used in executions, sodium thiopental, is no longer used. States have replaced the drug with midazolam. There have been problems with the drug being used anaesthetic and these problems include gasping, snorting or choking sounds. In Wood’s case, inmates reported hearing Wood gagging, snorting and harrumpling. Arizona is not the first state to report significant problems with a lethal injection. Some say that the executions are botched when an inmate has endured prolonged suffering. It is unclear when an execution is ‘botched.’ ```"
57489,2,"Execution witnesses are being asked to describe deaths on death row as more than 30 inmates are killed within two weeks.  In Arizona, a state has to wait hours longer than usual to put one man to death.  According to the Death Penalty Information Center, more men and women will be killed today across the United States than on any of the previous 219 days of 2014. The death penalty has been around as long as the United States itself and it remains on the books in more than half of the 50 American states. The issue of capital punishment has resurfaced, with several executions scheduled for the next few days. One of those killed by lethal injection was Arizona death row inmate Joseph Wood, whose execution was witnessed by journalists, family members and others for an average of two hours.  The state's department of correction has since said Wood was not in severe pain and did not suffer, insisting the execution was carried out as normal and in line with state regulations. Arizona was one of the first to use a new procedure for its executions, which involved giving Wood an additional dose of the drug that should have killed him, leaving him in agony for more than an hour before he finally"
57489,3,"During the 2014 election in Arizona, two ballot measures offered citizens a possible choice: a more-or-less constitutional amendment for the abolition of the death penalty in the state in the first one, while the other was an initiative to ensure that the process of execution is fair, and does not give unequal treatment to poorer inmates over wealthy ones during the appeals process. The Arizona Supreme Court has decided to postpone the election of the second measure, since it would have affected the appeals of Joseph Rudolph Wood, who is on death row. The first measure failed to gain traction at the ballot, thanks to campaign opposition from groups such as Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who stated that he felt it was unlikely that the current death row inmates would be pardoned or released if the ballot passed. The Supreme Court issued an emergency order to postpone the second initiative; this move was made after the execution of Wood, who was executed after a two-hour procedure that led him to lose consciousness and then regain it. He died afterwards. The Arizona Department of Corrections denied that Wood had undergone torture, but the United Nations Committee on the Rights"

Although she was suspected of murdering many more, the Colombian was eventually convicted of three killings in 1985, including that of a two-year-old boy, for which she served nearly 20 years behind bars. In 2004, she was deported to her native country and maintained a low profile in her hometown of Medellin.

47504,3,"Griselda Blanco was a notorious Colombian drug lord who rose to power in the 1970s and 1980s.

During her prime, Blanco was responsible for organizing the trafficking of massive quantities of cocaine from Colombia into the United States, making an untold amount of money in return.

But the gangster's life ended tragically, as it did violently.

Earlier this month, Blanco was shot multiple times in Medellin, Colombia.

She died from her gunshot wounds days later, and rumors continue to abound about her death. According to local authorities, the hit was ordered by a gangster named Frankie, a fellow drug dealer that had issues with Blanco.

Although at first, these claims appeared to be credible, recent developments indicate that Frankie, whose real name is Jorge ""Pacho"" Herrera was arrested today.

Local authorities also announced at a brief news conference that the police were investigating Blanco’s connections to former Colombian President Ernesto Samper Pizano, and an official stated that the president may have been involved with the slaying."

  Article: Evaluation of the School Streets scheme also showed lower vehicle speeds on surrounding roads and a reduction in the number of cars around schools.
  A report to the city council's transport and environment committee recommended making the pilot permanent.
  The Living Streets Scotland charity wanted it rolled out nationwide.
  The 18-month scheme began in Edinburgh in September 2015.
  The nine primary schools in the scheme are: Abbeyhill, Colinton, Cramond, Duddingston, Sciennes, St John's, Clermiston, St Peter's, and Towerbank.
  Living Streets Scotland said other councils should also look at implementing the scheme.
  It is not calling for a complete ban on cars around all schools as it said each should be considered on a case-by-case basis.
  Stuart Hay, Living Streets Scotland director, said: ""We want to see this on a national basis.

The scheme involves banning vehicle traffic from 8:30-9:30am and 2:30-3:30pm at nine schools.

    The results showed that more children were walking at pick-up and drop-off times when the scheme was running. On the other hand, less children were walking just before the scheme was launched and after it ended.

44168,2,"2 May 2003 09:29 AM A British professor has warned that schoolgirls who are under intense parental pressure to excel in multiple activities are more likely to develop eating disorders and turn to alcohol and drug abuse. Carrie Paechter, a professor of education at Goldsmiths University London, says that middle-class parents push their daughters to excel at everything from sports, music, and academics, but that overexertion leads to eating and alcohol problems. Paechter wants to change the way teachers at schools treat girls who they believe may be experiencing such conditions, according to the Times Educational Supplement. Girls also need a ""hard dose of reality"" about the sexist world they face when they leave school, Paechter tells the heads of top private schools in Britain, according to the report.

Last month Ofsted said that the school in Warrington, Cheshire, is a ‘place of fear and intimidation’, where bullying takes place every lesson. An inquiry will seek to establish the basis of ‘deep-seated and entrenched’ disaffection among pupils and staff which is said to have festered for decades. The chair of governors, who was responsible for hiring staff, who left in disgrace, has said that Ofsted’s reports ‘do not paint an accurate picture’ of the school. The council has a contract with Culcheth to run it, and a council report says a review found the school has made ‘some progress’.

by . Sophie Jane Evans for MailOnline

Article: By Sophie Jane Evans for MailOnline .
It is just four days until the major golf contest between the U.S. and Europe  gets underway. So, Rickie Fowler has decided to show his support for America in the 2014 Ryder Cup - by shaving the letters 'USA' into his hair. The 25-year-old golfer, who is making his second appearance in the biennial competition, proudly showed off his new haircut during practice today. He took off his cap to reveal 'USA' shaved into the hair behind his right ear, before pointing out the patriotic design to photographers.

He told the conference: 'I thought it was great, terrific. It brings a light spirit to the team. 'I wouldn't be surprised if, heck, even Ted Bishop [the 60-year-old president of the PGA of America] puts 'USA' on the side of his head if it means we are going to win.'

27534,2,"Senate moving toward 'going nuclear' Actually confirming the nominee or passing the legislation takes only 50 votes, but because of the procedural rules, it pretty much takes 60 to invoke cloture and get anything done these days. By requiring only 51 votes, the entire character of the chamber would change. Instead of being forced to get buy-in from the minority party (Republicans right now), the majority party (Democrats right now) would be able to confirm anybody for whom they could get a simple majority. Actually 'going nuclear' is going to need 60 votes. That's because the Republicans themselves are proposing it -- and the filibuster is so ingrained into Senate tradition that there is no way they would allow Republicans to eliminate a power that was used against them, without giving them an equivalent say in the matter. The minority party has to agree (via a vote) in order for the new rules to take effect. It won't be happening any time soon. If the Republicans win back the majority in the 2014 midterms, they'll have 270 days to do whatever they want anyway -- and can use that time to force the Democrats"
27534,3,"Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada has announced that if Republicans refuse to yield any ground on judicial nominees, he will take the ""nuclear option"" and re-structure Senate voting procedures to require only 51 votes to confirm presidential nominees to any position that has already been confirmed at least once before. This would have been a simple change several years ago, but as filibusters have increased since 2009 such that only a minority of senators can prevent a vote, the Senate cannot confirm even nominees that were supported by all senators before Republicans started blocking such confirmations, because Senate rules require 60 votes to end a filibuster. Reid blamed Republicans for the procedural standoff, saying they have ""gone over the edge"" by blocking all of President Barack Obama's nominees.

In a speech on the Senate floor on Thursday, Reid called the blocking of nominees by Republicans ""outrageous"" and ""completely out of order,"" adding: ""With each day that passes, our democracy is increasingly threatened by this inaction. ...

However, testing revealed skulls were older and some bones in the crypt were as new as the 1800s or early 1900s.

He did not take that opportunity to apologize to the family members who were in the audience at the hearing. ""It makes me sad,"" he said, wiping his eyes.

Why? because he killed a man during an escape attempt in a Utah court house. He had a long history of violence and escape. When? April 2, 1985 Gardner fatally shot Burdell, who was there for another case, and shot and wounded bailiff Nick Kirk.``` What questions need to be asked? Who is the attorney that will present the case in court? Does he have a track record of doing this before? How do you prove that Gardner's past is no way related to this current offense? Would it not be wise to let the Jury decide Gardner's fate instead of the Parole Board of Utah? If the Jury decides, why would it be different?

### Security Researcher: North Korea Hacking Attack on Sony Was Just 'Saber Rattling'

Do you think it is well written? Are there ideas of improvements that can be suggested? Sent via Deppy <http://www.deppy.today/>"
69361,2,"North Korea was behind the Sony attack; 'We could apply sanctions with respect to any individual or entity who is providing them, in turn, material support,' he said. Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called for use of the full scope of the new sanctions announced after U.S. authorities said North Korea was behind the Sony attack. `The significance of this new Executive Order may come from the broad power it gives the president to target anyone who is a part of the North Korean government, or is assisting them in any way … that is if the administration chooses to use it to its full advantage,' he told the briefing. 'We need to step up and target those financial institutions in Asia and beyond that are supporting the brutal and dangerous North Korean regime.' When challenged by Royce to demonstrate that North Korea is involved in the cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment's corporate networks by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). He replied: 'I'm confident that the intelligence community and others are working on it and I am sure they will provide that intelligence in due course.' ```"
69361,3,"The United States aims to use new sanctions imposed on North Korea over the cyber attack on Sony Pictures to cut off the country's remaining links to the international financial system, a senior U.S. Treasury official said on Tuesday.

 Daniel Glaser, assistant secretary for terrorist financing at the U.S. Treasury Department, said past sanctions had already discouraged 'hundreds' of overseas banks, including China's major commercial banks, from doing business with North Korea. New sanctions announced by President Barack Obama on January 2 provided 'a tremendous amount of flexibility' and the goal was to identify remaining financial institutions that allowed North Korea access to the global system, which could face sanction themselves, Glaser told a House of Representatives briefing.

'The previous owners had inherited it and didn't really know a great deal about the vase other than that it was Chinese. 'They didn't quite understand the potential value of what they had. ```

The vase was made a century before the famous 300-year old Blue Willow pattern, but it carries a similar design with red bats, blue flowers, and gold trim.

The vase carried a pre-sale estimate of £200,000.

In 2011 two other vases sold for slightly less - around £700,000 and £900,000.

This latest sale has been criticised by one expert, who accused the auction house of being a profit-making venture.

Industry figures show that first-time buyers typically need to find a deposit of 18 percent to secure a mortgage. Using PwC data this equates to Â£64,800 in savings to get on the property ladder in 2020.

  A recent report from BNP Paribas Real Estate (www.bnprea.com), one of the country's biggest commercial property managers, suggested that rising home prices were one of the main reasons to be concerned about the future.

  PwC analysis also suggests that house prices in the capital will continue to rise sharply, but it is expecting regional variations in property values across the country, with an overall average 46% increase over the next 10 years.

The average rise of 5% a year would take house prices to Â£450,000 by 2020 - more than double the 2006 average.

# Wales' unsung heroes 'moved' by awards

Article: Dr David Nott from Trelech, Carmarthenshire, took the International award and Cairn Newton-Evans, of Ammanford, won the Citizenship award.
The annual ceremony took place in Cardiff on Thursday evening, with winners in nine categories.
It recognises the achievements of people in Wales from all walks of life.
While eight categories were nominated by the public, First Minister Carwyn Jones personally chose Sir Karl Jenkins and Dr Mererid Hopwood for his special award.
They composed the music and words for Cantata Memoria, a piece of choral work to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Aberfan disaster.
All of the winners were chosen from nominees that included Nizar Dahan from Swansea.
The 29-year-old from Sketty had been working in property development as a marketing consultant when the harrowing images of a three-year-old Syrian boy found drowned on a beach in Turkey drove him to act.
It led to him establishing the Swansea Humanitarian Aid Response Project -"

BBC Newsbeat reporter Tom Rogers reports.
Nizar Dahan has been a vocal campaigner for children's rights throughout his charity work.
He has helped hundreds of refugees living in appalling conditions across the world with his charity SHARP - which stands for Swansea Humanitarian Aid Response.
A huge part of 29-year-old Nizar's job is to talk, both to adults and children about their experiences.
His passion is clear, and he's driven to do even more.
Nizar's SHARP charity raises money and sends people they know to war torn Syria, as well as Greece and Jordan to bring help and medical aid to those who are suffering.
When a 3-year-old boy was pictured on a beach, it was that picture that changed Nizar's life.
The picture showed the motionless body of Alan Kurdi, a toddler who drowned with his brother and mother as they tried to cross the Mediterranean.
Nizar saw it while he was working as a marketing consultant.

He said the driver asked the woman to go to the office if she had a complaint, which she did, and another National Express member of staff came to the bus and asked the man to leave.

  A Lutheran minister, Rev. George L. Fox, from  Maine, told them how they could find eternal peace. Then all the  Lutheran pastors went to the boat and helped each one of the  men.

  The pastors' courage gave their men so much  faith that they gave themselves to God. The pastors said  goodbye to their own sons and to their men.

  About 300 men survived. They were not the strongest, nor  the youngest, but the 300 men that had faith. These  men got to live with their families, or were allowed to  serve other missions.  A small book, “God Was Our Submarine'' was later written about  their amazing survival.

It was a hopeless task--the fire had to be put out or the entire ship would go down. But within minutes, more torpedoes hit the Dorchester, which erupted into a fiery sea of flames. Soon, the ship began to sink beneath the waves as all aboard rushed to either evacuate, or cling to anything they could grab to try to survive as the ship slowly disappeared. As the fire spread and the ship began to sink, the captain and his officers quickly discovered that their only hope was to put the ship's lifeboats into the water on the side least affected by the blaze.

  Article: When the captain told the men to abandon ship, the four chaplains helped the men get their life jackets on, then they linked arms and stood on the deck. One of them said 'the Lord is my shepherd.' The next was a jewish rabbi and said some things from the prayer 'Shema'. A black minister said 'As we pass through death to triumph, so may we pass through life to a higher achievement.' When they passed out there were no jackets were left so they took their own jackets of, got in the water, and they tried to save the people but many got lost from them in the ocean. The next day, bodies started floating up to the surface. There were four people, all chaplains floating together. An hour later a boat passed and"

Article: Jailed pedophile Rolf Harris has abandoned his push to appeal 12 convictions for sexually assaulting four girls in the United Kingdom.

 Harris's initial application was refused by a single Court of Appeal judge in late October and the disgraced entertainer is now out of time to ask the court to revisit the issue.

 Harris was sentenced in July to five years and nine months' jail for indecently assaulting four girls in Britain between 1968 and 1986, however he's expected to serve less than three years behind bars.

25850,3,"Rolf Harris will serve just under three years in a British prison for a series of sex offences against four women and girls before he is eligible for parole. The Australian entertainer will first serve about half of his total sentence before he can earn some remission from further behaviour in jail.

He was convicted at the Old Bailey in London in July on 12 counts of indecent assault between 1968 and 1986.

The 84-year-old was cleared of five other offences against four other alleged victims, who gave evidence during his month-long trial.

His victims included a seven-year-old autograph hunter, two teenage girls and a friend of his daughter, whom he abused for more than 16 years.

Harris had not been in court to hear the sentencing due to poor health.

Judge Justin Riley sentenced Harris to at least five years, and no more than five years, and nine months in prison for the offences.

The judge told Harris: ""I am satisfied that this was a persistent pattern of abuse of young girls over a considerable period of time.""

Goodwin spent years filming the women and children on fences, trees and through windows. The court hearing was told at one point Goodwin placed his penis against the bedroom window of a 25-year-old woman and she saw him but did not know was he was doing. At another home, he used a fishing rod with a camera attached to it to film into a room where a teenager was sitting on the toilet. The child did not know she was under surveillance until police turned up at the house on a welfare check and seized the computer. Goodwin was arrested in September 2012 and pleaded guilty to 17 counts of committing a serious indictable offence and six counts of filming himself committing an indictable offence. He earlier pleaded guilty to 232 counts of making child exploitation material available on the internet. He will be eligible for parole in 2020.

#### Why Are Antidepressant Prescriptions on the Rise? | Psychology Today

Many of us have a need to be liked by others. Some people go to extreme lengths to get approval from others. They are called overly compliant people. Some people want to please their friends and don’t mind doing what they can to help the other. But many people like to appear to be likeable even to the point of being insincere. Unfortunately many of us have learned to think of people liking us as being a measure of our worth. This view is false and can lead people to say and do things that they believe will make others like them. It also leads people to be anxious if they believe they are not performing well at the task. Sometimes these people fear rejection in a romantic relationship or in a family or group context. But there is also research by psychologist and sociologists showing that people who are highly likable feel socially insecure in groups. One of the authors is Nicholas Epley, an associate professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicago’s Booth School."

A French consular agent has been arrested on rape charges in Bangalore. He faces charges of rape in India, police have said.
Investigators in the southern Indian city began an enquiry on Friday after his Indian wife alleged he sexually abused their three-year-old daughter.

Officials at the French consulate said they were cooperating with authorities and it remained in touch with the family of the child.

  In 2007, I came up with an exercise for the students to practice in class. In his paper, Sutton described this exercise. One reason I liked this exercise was because it was fun for the students. It was also challenging. This was not like the other activities we gave our students. We were always telling them to not be so sure that they knew everything there is to know about medicine. It is easier to be confident when you do this. I knew this would be a challenge for me when I set out to write the book. Some of my favorite doctors gave me ideas for the writing. We used pictures from real life situations to help the students put themselves into the picture. They had to draw from their own experience. They had to think about what happened when they saw a patient. They had to think about the outcome based on their own observations and experiences. They had to answer"

Sherwood claimed that the player should be comfortable with his surroundings a year after he joined them but he has been performing way below his expectations and thus should be dropped from time to time to give other strikers a chance.
However, this season the 29-year-old forward has made seven appearances for the north London club scoring two goals and only managed two assists.
During his time at the White Hart Lane he has made 40 appearances, all from the bench, in all competition managing to score 13 goals.
