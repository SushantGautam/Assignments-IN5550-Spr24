As you can see, even with a lot of effort and with this tool and some manual work, we haven't been able to summarize what it needs because the tool summarizes sentences and doesn't understand the sense.
So we see that this summary has some errors, it omits a lot of important parts and it doesn't follow the same pattern and style than in the original article (because the tool uses a template).

24322,3,"In a bid to combat rising inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates earlier this year. The central bank had previously kept rates at record low levels to stimulate the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. But inflation rose significantly, driven by supply chain disruptions and rising energy costs. The interest rate hikes are expected to result in a slowing of inflation, although there will likely be a short-term impact on employment. Policymakers will look to balance continued support for businesses that need loans while also addressing inflation concerns. Central banks in other countries are also grappling with record-high inflation. For example, the Reserve Bank of Australia and Bank of England have raised interest rates. The moves affect individuals and companies worldwide by increasing the cost of borrowing, which can affect decisions to purchase homes or invest in businesses. ```

38546,3,"The Tory conference is today focused on the economy as the UK's new Chancellor of the Exchequer delivers his first budget. Philip Hammond, a careful, serious Conservative - in contrast to his more flamboyant predecessor George Osborne - said that Britain could expect ""strong and sustainable"" economic growth at the heart of his budget, which will include the abolition of austerity target for the UK public finances, in a marked departure from Osborne's five-year strategy for paying back the country's budget deficit.
This change in approach suggests that Theresa May's government will spend more than the Conservatives had previously planned before the UK leaves the EU in 2019. However, Hammond warned last week that Brexit would leave the economy 4% smaller than it otherwise would be. 	This represents a sharp shift from the rhetoric and politics we've heard from the Conservatives since 2009: ""We're broke"" ""there is no money"" ""tax hikes have failed"".

Putin's numbers aren't just high; they've surged from a 61% low in Nov. 2013 as events in Ukraine unfolded and despite sanctions hitting the country. And as opposed to Americans, a majority of Russians think their country is on the right track. A majority of Americans, 53% according to a CNN poll released last week, disapprove of Obama while 85% of Russians approve of Putin, according to a November poll from the highly cited Levada Center, an independent polling agency.

23430,2,"Despite struggling economic news, Russian President Vladimir Putin remains popular with the Russian people, even as his counterpart, U.S. President Barack Obama, contends with some of his lowest approval numbers of late. Putin's popularity soared over the last year, according to a November Levada Center poll. And while American and Russian presidential approval ratings don't perfectly correlate, Putin's skyrocketing popularity isn't limited to presidential race results. Nearly two-thirds of respondents in Russia think that their country is on the right track. Despite Putin's popularity, the Kremlin must contend with an economy in decline. On Thursday Putin outlined a policy aimed at improving the lives of Russian citizens, but acknowledged Russia could face a recession in the coming two months amid Russian military involvement in Ukraine and a spree of sanctions imposed by the West. The crisis over Ukraine -- Russia seized Crimea and has supported armed rebels in eastern Ukraine -- has had global economic implications, particularly for Russia which had invested heavily in Ukraine. ```

  A summary system for a given type of input should generate a concise representation of the input which captures its most important aspects under the scope of the type to which the input belongs. For example, the system should be able to summarize a movie to fit the genre of the movie. In this paper, we aim to build a general-purpose system that can summarize the semantic content of an article based on the type of that article. Based on a detailed analysis of the article and using heuristics, we develop our system with a novel architecture. An encoder embeds a raw article using a Transformer-based pre-trained model followed by two decoders. One decoder generates a summary for the entire article. The other decoder generates multiple summaries based on the defined classes of the article. Our two major contributions are as follows:

10758,1,"Given the current economic state of the world, it is necessary for the government to implement policies that will stimulate the economy. This includes increasing public spending to support the purchase of new equipment, building infrastructure, and providing tax incentives. The government should also reduce tariffs for Chinese exporters to encourage trade with China and expand trade between the two countries. Additionally, the government should create a national public corporation to manage the procurement of medical equipment and to promote the development and use of high-quality, low-cost medical equipment in China. Furthermore, the government should focus on strengthening the rule of law and punishing corruption of state officials, while also implementing a reform to the health care system.```

10758,2,"The U.S. Federal Reserve hinted that a long awaited rate rise could come in September, while raising interest rates on short term loans for the first time in almost a decade. The policy decision comes amid signs of stabilization in the U.S. economy after nearly two years of turmoil from the global financial crisis. The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been debating for months how to end its stimulus program, which has helped the economy recover since the recession began. The Fed last week reported that the U.S. economy grew more slowly than expected in April, and the Commerce Department said last week that factory output dropped. ```

10758,3,"The Federal Reserve will not be raising its key interest rate on Thursday, in what would have been the first increase since the rate was cut near zero during the financial crisis of 2008.
The economy is strengthening and inflation is nearing the Fed's 2 percent target, but not yet at the rate that would justify a rate hike.
The Federal Reserve's most recent economic projections called for as many as three rate hikes this year.
However, uncertainty about the impact of a slowing economy and concerns about inflation have led to a less aggressive outlook from the Federal Reserve.
The Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee voted to keep its benchmark interest rate near zero through the end of 2016, continuing its policy of holding down short-term rates in order to stimulate the economy.
Despite indications that the economy is gradually strengthening, inflation is still not at the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target and unemployment is lower than the Federal Reserve expected.
The Federal Reserve will not be raising rates until unemployment falls to 5 percent or inflation reaches 2 percent, whichever comes first.```

The global economy is facing an unprecedented series of challenges due to the combined impact of the Coronavirus pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change.

Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing the markets and fostering sustainable growth.

Furthermore, the World Health Organization, along with several other organizations, has warned that healthcare systems in many countries will be overburdened as demand for healthcare services increases, and that this could result in a global health crisis. Therefore, it is even more crucial to ensure that healthcare services are accessible, affordable, and available to all, and that countries have the necessary resources and infrastructure in place to deal with the potential impacts of the pandemic on healthcare systems.

The authors propose a new neural network architecture called “Deep Learning Ensembles” (or “DLE”) that can recover from faults introduced by the adversary. Deep learning ensembles combine the predictions of many similar deep learning models, the authors show that this makes the ensemble more reliable and resilient to adversarial faults. The authors propose using a neural network that can predict when other neural networks have made errors.

Bayern have lost none of their superpower aura since winning the treble in 2013. On the contrary, under Pep Guardiola, they are developing into an even more formidable force.

What's the name of the algorithm?
We have used **Long Former (LF).**
Algorithm:
The LF algorithm takes a sentence as input and maps it to a sequence of features, which are then fed into a model that predicts the next word in the sentence. The sequence of features are derived from the sentence using language modeling.

 What is unique about this approach?
LF algorithm is a sequential algorithm, which means it is not prone to local minima or maxima. It follows a tree from parent to children until it reaches the leaves. This method ensures that all the children nodes are explored before moving to the next level.

- It's important to point out that LF doesn't always follow a tree structure. It can sometimes take a path that is more complicated than a simple tree, but it always ensures that all children nodes are explored. This is because LF"

# A Simple Evaluation for First Sentence Selection
For the first question above, our answer would be no, because the sentence ""Keane has returned to the dugout under Paul Lambert at Aston Villa"" is quite general and vague compared to the other sentences: 
""He may have a reputation as one of the scariest men in football, but Roy Keane showed he had a somewhat softer side following the hug he received from Aston Villa's mascot on Saturday."" 

""Smiles: Roy Keane was embraced"

""I trust his judgement. He picks the team and I have to do whatever I have to do.""
Hearts briefly led at Celtic Park through Jamie Walker's impressive strike, Gary Mackay-Steven levelling.
And Roberts, signed by City from Fulham for around £12m, came to the fore by finishing well either side of half-time to secure the three points for Deila's men - moving them seven points clear at the top of the Scottish Premiership.
""It is a challenge for everyone,"" added Roberts. ""Everyone wants to play in the team and be involved.

In a time of austerity, when a five-year cost of living squeeze has meant hardship and sacrifices for many, the idea that shoppers might spend thousands on the 'Decadence' hamper seems remarkable. But Harrods has experienced huge interest in the luxury collection given that some of its customers, including billionaire Russian oligarchs and Arab potentates, have come through the credit crunch largely unscathed. The news prompted Aldi, which has become Britain's favourite budget retailer with sales up by more than 30 per cent in a year, to create a cut-price version. Food snobs may balk at the idea, but Aldi Christmas puddings recently beat the best that Harrods has to offer.

The Kiev government has imposed a city-wide curfew, and a new ban on night-time street gatherings. The attackers are said to have been dressed in camouflage gear, and it is believed they are members of the militant Euromaidan movement opposed to the Kiev-friendly government and its pro-Western policies. ```

Jacob Zuma filed an urgent application at the South Gauteng High Court for an order to have the portrait removed from the gallery and photographs of it taken off the City Press newspaper website. Both the gallery and the newspaper refused on the grounds it would be censorship. The matter was set to be heard today. Jacob Zuma claims that the portrait infringed on his constitutional rights to dignity and privacy. He said he felt 'shocked, personally offended and violated' when he saw a copy of The Spear for the first time. He said the painting depicted him as a 'a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect'. The reporter saw a man in a suit painting a red X over the president's genital area and then his face.

4221,3,"The painting is called ""The Spear,"" and it shows Jacob Zuma, the President of South Africa, with his eyes closed, but with his genitals fully visible. The painting was controversial because it depicts Zuma's nudity and penis. Zuma accused the artist, Brett Murray, of depicting him as a womanizer, which was offensive to him. The ANC said that the portrayal of a world leader in a negative light ""constituted a personal attack on the highest office in the land."" Murray's lawyer argued that the painting was part of a larger theme of South African life and history and was not personal towards Zuma. The South African law, however, allows the depiction of a sitting president. The High Court ruled that the painting should be left in the Goodman Gallery. Murray says that the painting is not an attack on Zuma but a celebration of South African life and culture. The ANC called the painting ""a personal attack on the office of president"", and it said that it violated Zuma's right to protect his dignity. Murray and the publisher of the painting have appealed the decision.```

Staff from the council were overwhelmed by the sheer amount of waste and were forced to call for back-up. They were later able to remove the fridges on the road after an inspection of the area, but said they are still working to ensure the entire area is clean.

She added that it is unacceptable to dump fridges on a road and that the council is currently gathering evidence to identify who is responsible.

The researchers compared the mutations found in individual cancer cells with a known database, revealing remarkable differences between the cancerous cells. This suggests that instead of having one cancer, patients with leukaemia have multiple cancers, which can be difficult to treat because treatments may not always target the entire cancer. The findings shed new light on the complex diversity of cancer and have important implications for the development of more effective targeted therapies.

According to Prof Greaves, their research provides the opportunity to gain knowledge about the different subclones and identify which one is the most important to target. 
Prof Swanton emphasizes the complexity of cancer and the difficulties of controlling it.

This is an automatic summary of articles. It was made possible by AI. Thanks to everyone to AI training.

The summary is done by an AI model that was written to predict the top summary of news papers. The model was trained on articles from 2020-03-21 to 2022-12-17. We run it on daily bases using the most recent paper, then we calculate coverage from each article based on the last 500 articles. We also add the name of the articles from which the summary was generated.

Text summarization is a subfield of natural language processing (NLP) that aims to automatically generate concise, informative summaries from longer texts, such as documents, articles, or transcripts.

For a machine to generate a coherent summary, it must have a strong understanding of the language and the overall meaning of the text. This includes analyzing the structure of sentences, understanding the relationships between words and concepts, and identifying key information and themes.

In text summarization, NLP techniques such as machine learning and deep learning are used to analyze raw text and extract salient information. Machine learning models are trained on large datasets of text and summaries, which allows them to learn"

The method has been developed by a team of researchers from the University of Nottingham in the UK and is based on the measurement of the thermal mass of building materials. The researchers found that buildings with a high thermal mass are more energy efficient, as they release heat more slowly into the atmosphere, reducing the need for artificial heating. The researchers also found that buildings with a low thermal mass are less energy efficient, as they release heat more quickly into the atmosphere, causing more artificial heating to be used. The researchers believe that this new way to measure the energy efficiency of buildings could be used by governments to encourage the construction of more energy efficient buildings and reduce their energy consumption.

Consequently, the people of St. Vincent and the Grenadines are dealing with the aftermath of significant damage to their homes, livelihoods, and infrastructure. The local infrastructure has also been severely impacted, with some buildings rendered uninhabitable and access to critical services such as healthcare has been restricted. The displacement of residents has exacerbated the situation, with many people forced to relocate to safe areas or seek temporary accommodation. The eruption has had significant socio-economic impacts on the region and has made it harder for people to recover and rebuild"

  Article: A new study has found that COVID-19 may be deadlier than initially thought. The review, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, examined available data on deaths due to the virus worldwide and found that it was significantly underreported.

It is unknown who is responsible for the kidnapping, but the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Aleppo, Paul Yazigi, and the Syriac Orthodox Bishop John Ibrahim are well-known figures in Syria and their disappearance raises concerns about the security situation in the country.

## Rationale:

The most relevant part of the original article is the report of the kidnapping of the two bishops, as it highlights the"
29835,4,"Two prominent clergymen, Greek Orthodox Bishop Paul Yazigi and Syriac Orthodox Bishop John Ibrahim, are kidnapped and their whereabouts are unknown. Each side in the civil war blames others for the snatching.``` **Question :** What is the reason of difference between the first and second paragraph of the answer (as explained, because the second paragraph contains details and specific information that are not necessary to correctly summarize the content of the article)? 

## Solution

 
The answer is correct.

 
When summarizing an article, it's important to strike a balance between providing enough details to capture the essence of the content and avoiding unnecessary information.

 
In the original article, there is a lot of details about the context of the kidnapping, which includes information on the civil war, the identity of the kidnappers, and the government's reaction. However, this information is not necessary to understand the main idea of the article, which is that two prominent clergymen have been kidnapped and their whereabouts are unknown.

 
It's important to note that summarizing an article is not about removing every detail, but rather about"

## Summary 1
Title: Part of a set of prison reforms announced by the government to modernise the country's notorious prisons - Legal aid centres will be set up in and better health care will also be provided, the new rules say.

There are more than 400,000 inmates in prisons across India, with more than half of them awaiting trial.

Under the new guidelines, jail authorities will let death row convicts see their families before execution.

Last year, a family of a man convicted for plotting bomb attacks in was denied a meeting with him ahead of his hanging.

Another part of the reforms involves the establishment of new legal aid centres, which will aim to provide guidance to poorer inmates especially those awaiting trial.

The new guidelines also make it mandatory for jail officers to ensure the safety of female prisoners and care for their children.

Prison staff will be trained to deal with cases of gender and sexual violence.

""This has been drawn from the UN"
56377,1,"The Indian Government is taking measures to modernise its prisons and meet international standards, including the establishment of new legal aid centres and provision of health care. These reforms aim to improve the treatment of female prisoners, deal with cases of gender and sexual violence, and address concerns surrounding capital punishment. Some of these steps include:
1. Establishment of legal aid centres in all jails: These centres will aim to provide guidance to inmates, especially those awaiting trial.
2. Better health care: The prisons will now provide better health care to inmates.
3. Measures for female prisoners: Jail officers will be trained to ensure the safety of female prisoners and care for their children.
4. Dealing with gender and sexual violence: Measures will be taken to address gender and sexual violence.
5. Meeting international standards: The reforms aim to meet international standards set by the UN.
The government statement also mentioned the rejection of a request to see a death row convict before execution last year, as a case in point.```

The creation of guidelines for handling the cases of prisoners on death row, including allowing family members to see them before execution. 3.

We think we share the view that in a political world dominated by mass communications, there is little room for forgiveness about scandals, or other personal failures, or a poor record in office. Yet on those grounds, Berlusconi should have died a political death long ago, rather than coming a very close second in this week's Italian elections. Foreigners, perhaps, will always remain baffled by Berlusconi's success in continuing to attract voters. But Italians, horrified by him though plenty of them are, tend to be a lot less surprised. That is because they think of him in context, rather than in isolation. In Italian politics, the context is all. What this means, and what it meant for Berlusconi's remarkable feat in nearly doubling his share of the vote between his opinion poll ratings in November 2012 and the election itself, can be laid out in the following evidently misleading indicators: .

Berlusconi makes unbelievable promises, but his key promises have been believable -- like his pledge to cut or even abolish the hated property tax. His record makes him untrustworthy, but he has promised to cut taxes in the past and delivered. Italians know all of this and have a somewhat more nuanced view of his politics.  ```

The message, released on a government website, prompted outrage as Leung has been called “the wolf” by pro-democracy protesters. Elected in 2012, Leung was known for controversial remarks like comparing gay marriage with incest and pedophilia and praising the military for its efficiency and effectiveness in dealing with unrest.“Last year was no easy ride for Hong Kong,” said Leung in the statement. “In the coming year, I hope that all people in Hong Kong will take inspiration from the sheep’s character and pull together in an accommodating manner to work for Hong Kong’s future. “Sheep are widely seen to be mild and gentle animals living peacefully in groups,” explained Leung.Leung’s new year message comes less than a month after the anti-establishment Occupy protests in late 2014.

Wang Tse, a Chinese gangster, has been arrested for sexual assault and blackmailing a prison officer.

85272,3,"In Britain, the supplements market is worth £700 million. Vitamin D and multivitamins are very popular. Doctors recommend multivitamins for those who have cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. However, they are not advised to take vitamin D supplements because it does not make any difference. There is no connection between low levels of vitamin D and any disease. It is likely that, instead of deficiency causing diseases, diseases cause low vitamin D levels. Therefore, scientists should pay more attention to ways of treating diseases rather than vitamin D levels. The problem of low vitamin D levels is mainly in Britain. Vitamin D improves bone density and prevents osteoporosis and rickets. Some pregnant women do not develop enough vitamin D while they are pregnant. Their children are also at risk. The NHS could save £1.3 billion if all pregnant women were provided with free vitamin D supplements. Dame Sally Davies called for free vitamin D supplements.

87898,3,"The Chinese government has announced that the yuan will be allowed to fluctuate within a specific range against other currencies from now on, ending years of strict control over the country's exchange rate. The move signifies a major step towards financial liberalization in China and could potentially have far-reaching consequences for the global economy. The depreciation of the yuan, or renminbi, in the past few days has been attributed to the impact of the ongoing trade war between China and the United States, as well as recent domestic factors such as a weakening economy and faltering growth. The depreciation could lead to a rise in inflation in China and could also have a spillover effect on other emerging market economies. However, it is also likely to make Chinese exports more competitive, which could boost economic growth. The government's decision to move towards a more market- determined exchange rate is seen as a positive development and a sign that China is committed to opening up its economy to further international competition. It remains to be seen how the new exchange rate regime will affect China's economy and the global economy in the long run.```

A senior fellow of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, Tao Wang, said that this move to a market-based system to set the exchange rate was long overdue. He also said that this would give the yuan more flexibility to respond quickly to changing economic circumstances. Wang added that this move is also part of China's efforts to make its economy less reliant on exports. This could help reduce the risks of volatile swings in the exchange rate."

   A 35-year-old woman died during an extreme sexual fantasy, according to a newly-released post-mortem report. The woman from Kensington and Chelsea died on May 14 after sustaining internal injuries during the 16-hour-long ordeal.

The assessment, conducted by the firm Atos Healthcare, is designed to assess whether people who are seeking employment and support allowance (ESA) or incapacity benefit (IB) can return to work. Unfortunately, the quality of the WCA has been poor. One-third of the assessments it has conducted have been overturned on appeal, which suggests that the firm is not adequately assessing people's ability to work. The government has also been failing to meet its own deadline of moving everyone receiving IB onto ESA by April 2017. This is one of the many problems the company is facing in conducting these assessments. A DWP spokesman told MPs that Atos could not deliver the quality of work the government was looking for at the capacity they are being asked to.

In 2015, the contract was extended until 2018. The assessments are used to help determine eligibility for the Employment and Support Allowance and Incapacity Benefit. After concerns were voiced about the quality of work carried out by Atos, the DWP revealed in February 2018 that the firm would hand over 50 per cent of its work to a third party. This came after 14 per cent of Employment and Support Allowance tests in 2017 were overturned on appeal, which amounts to more than 90,000 cases.

Manchester City came from two goals down to beat Bayern Munich 3-2 in the Champions League Group D match at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday night. City had looked dead and buried inside the first 15 minutes as Bayern raced into a 2-0 lead. Thomas Muller opened the scoring after five minutes sliding home a low left-foot shot past City keeper Joe Hart. Seven minutes later, Mario Gotze doubled the lead capitalizing on a dithering City defense to fire home from six yards following a corner kick.

1. 
I think it is important to know this information. It's the fact that North Korean soldiers don't get fed in the North. Their military isn't properly fed and as a result they sneak into China, and sometimes kill people in their stealthy search for food. This is a serious risk to China, and so far, the Chinese government has chosen not to publicize this issue. And so far, the Chinese government has not sent these North Korean soldiers back.
2. If the information in the paragraph above were a newscast, where would you place it on your TV? Explain why, briefly. :

 
I would place it in the 11 o'clock slot. It is fairly disturbing and should be shown at an hour later in the evening as it can get a little graphic (mentioning beating or shooting North Koreans to death in front of civilians).

By making green investments in renewable energy sources, industries can reduce reliance on fossil fuels, minimize pollution, and create a more sustainable future. The transition to a green economy is crucial for addressing climate change and promoting long-term economic growth.

What I need to do next is to figure out how to generate a summary. I'm not familiar with this technology yet, and I just started exploring this problem a few days ago.


 ## Some questions

  - How important is it to generate a summary in plain text vs. other formats?

- How important is it to limit the length of the summary?

- Is it a good idea to provide two summaries with a maximum of 200 words each, one for the whole article and one for a particular section?

- Is it better to produce summaries without headings, only words or"

The National Police Chiefs' Council said the campaign aims ""to make 'driving distracted' as socially unacceptable as drink driving"". The national week of action comes after a previous one in May, which the police said resulted in the detection of 2,323 offences across the week. It comes after an RAC survey in September suggested the number of motorists illegally using mobile phones while at the wheel was rising. Of the motorists asked, 31% said they had used a handheld phone behind the wheel compared with 8% in 2014. As part of the latest campaign week, police officers will work together with paramedics to educate the public on the risks of using phones while driving. The officers on the dedicated patrols will be using unmarked vans, helmet cams, high-seated vehicles and high vantage points to catch offenders, the police said.

# Answer: In Python, you can convert a list to a dictionary by using the [dict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict) function. This function takes a list and a key name as arguments and returns a new dictionary containing the items from the list:

# ```python
# lists = [""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d"", ""e""]
# mapping = dict(lists)
# print(mapping)

Its unusual shape, with a knobbly 'handle' and a hooked end, originally led historians to believe that it was a practical object used for catching fish. However, archaeologists suggest that the rod was actually a magical item belonging to a sorceress who was on the margins of society. They suggest that the reason it was bent before being buried with its owner was to remove its magical properties - possibly to prevent the witch coming back from the dead. The rod has been part of the British Museum's collection since 1894, when it was discovered in Norway's Romsdal province. Magical rituals are thought to have been central to many early medieval societies, but in most regions the advent of Christianity displaced them and obliterated all trace. However, Scandinavia was not converted to Christianity until the late 10th and early 11th centuries, meaning that we have much more historical and architectural evidence about their pagan beliefs.```

Summary: Finding a new job can be a daunting task, but what can make it even more difficult is the fear of losing your job to the next person. In fact, 1 in 3 employees say that they need to take their job with them to a new one in order to land a new position. This is because employers are more likely to hire someone who already has experience working for them. If you are looking for a new job, it is important to make sure that your current job is going with you. If not, you may find yourself out of work.

34334,3,"The driver of the Mazda RX8 car was lucky to be alive after his vehicle crashed into a road sign at 70mph. This was due to the road being very wet, and the driver's car hydroplaning on a patch of standing water, causing him to skid towards the bank and crash into the sign. The car sustained severe damage and was completely written off. However, the driver escaped unharmed, which is a miracle given the impact. The crash occurred in Canterbury on a Saturday morning and was captured on dash-cam footage, where it can be seen that the car is speeding along the dual carriageway. In the aftermath of the crash, the driver got out without any injuries or obvious scratches or pain. This is likely due to the fact that the car came to a standstill without going back into the dual carriageway, preventing any further damage to the driver or the car. It is a testament to the safety features of modern cars that the driver was able to walk away from such a significant crash without any injuries. The incident serves as a reminder to always drive responsibly, especially in wet weather conditions where the risks of losing control of the car are high.```"

If it was, there had been an ""inside job."" Because the theft was not uncovered when the flight arrived in Zurich, and it was only when the plane landed at JFK airport in New York that they knew that $1.2 million of the 92 million dollars aboard was gone. The theft was discovered when the cargo was being counted, which is standard procedure, which led to authorities discovering that the Swiss Air crate had a big hole of a forklift in it. Because the forklift hole was covered, it wasn't until later that authorities discovered the hole was there. Currently it is being speculated if the money was stolen from Swiss Air during its flight in Zurich, by a JFK airport employee or someone outside of the airport.

## Moranbong band due to play three shows in China cancelled
 
A popular North Korean pop
 band has unexpectedly turned around and flown back home during a tour in China.
The Moranbong band had
planned a three-day series of concerts in the Chinese capital.
On Friday it reportedly performed a number of patriotic songs in front of a few dozen Chinese government officials and
 a dozen journalists
in Beijing.
But hours later, the band left the country without doing the concerts.
The Moranbong band plays a mixture of Western-style and North Korea’s national and ethnic songs.
It is often associated to
 North Korea
leader Kim Jong-un.
The cancellation leaves
 questions about the
status of ties between the two close
 allies.

That setback dealt a serious blow to Ukraine's efforts to reclaim the southeastern region of Kharkiv, which is home to around 4 million people.
Izyum fell to Russian forces shortly after the September 2 launch of Putin's latest ""special military operation"" to recapture the region and end the war.

In order to identify important keywords in the above sentence, we first conduct preprocessing to clean the text and prepare the input of the model. Below is the preprocessing process:
 - Remove special characters in the sentence
 - Lowercase all letters
 - Remove number
 - Remove punctuation, e.g. '?', '!', ',', "":”, "".
 - Replace ""n't"" with ""not""
 - Replace tabs with spaces
 - Remove leading or trailing spaces

 After doing the above, the summarization task will be formulated as a classification problem, where the task is to classify the text representation into a limited number of categories based on their keyword distributions. To accomplish this, a bag-of-words (BOW) model is introduced to extract keywords from the text. BOW can summarize keywords from any document (text or image, etc.) with just the word frequencies, regardless of their locations and patterns. Thus, if there are n words in the document, the document can be represented as a 1xn vector (one-hot vector).

User 2: There's already a ton of text there, so it's hard to improve upon it, but some minor edits would improve it further; try to avoid using vague words like ""the global economy"". Instead, say ""international supply chains"" for example. Also, the last sentence is a little redundant; there's no reason to say ""with a view to improving it"", it's implied by ""Hodgson has been appointed by Hodgson as a project manager to improve it""

So I'd summarise it like this:

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused challenges globally, with the economy taking a severe hit.

The pandemic has had a negative impact on businesses worldwide and has impacted employment levels, causing many to lose their jobs.

Government responses range from bailouts and stimulus packages to help businesses and individuals to more restrictive measures such as lockdowns and border closures to prevent the spread of the virus.

Global supply chain disruptions

The pandemic has also caused disruptions in global supply chains, with many industries struggling to maintain production and delivery of goods and services.

This has led to shortages in certain goods and has caused delays in shipping and delivery.

As a result, businesses have had to adapt to new ways of working and many have had to close down temporarily.

Inflation and economic inequality

Global inflation has also increased, with prices of certain goods and services rising rapidly.

This has made it more difficult for low-income families to afford basic necessities and has caused economic inequality to deepen.

This has led to protests in many countries, with people demanding change and access to basic human"

The findings, which were published in the journal Cell, focus on a protein called BECN1, which is involved in an essential survival mechanism in cells. This mechanism, called macroautophagy, is critical for protecting cells from harmful substances that accumulate inside them. “This study has revealed that BECN1 is a central regulatory hub that controls both cancer progression and chemotherapy drug resistance,” said senior author Dr. Lianzhou Wang of the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio. “This means that by manipulating the levels or activity of BECN1, we may be able to change the way cancer cells respond to therapy.” The study found that high amounts of BEC"

It not only redefined what a music video could be but also marked a turning point in MTV's programming, as the network's playlist had previously been dominated by rock music. When MTV first launched in 1981, it modeled its playlist on the most popular album-oriented rock (AOR) radio format of the time, which meant that music by black artists was largely left out. But the success of ""Thriller"" and the increased showcasing of black artists' music on MTV ushered in more diversity and led to an expansion of the network's playlist to include other genres. However, the subsequent era of VH1 was characterized by a resurgence of music from the 1960s and 1970s, which overshadowed the growth of hip-hop, rap, reggae, and R&B.

41464,3,"Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" set the standard for videos, but there are also parallels to the current state of MTV. During the early '80s, there was a lot of tension and criticism of MTV for not playing black music on the network. This was partly due to the segregation of the music by race on radio formats and MTV. When they launched in 1981, MTV based their content and playlists off of AOR radio, which further alienated black audiences. Some viewers today may not be aware that the station used to be a music station that played both black and white artists, with most of the content being white. But they have strayed away for a while now, to a point where most people watch it to see reality shows like ""16 and Pregnant.""

32258,3,"The Obama administration is struggling with its signature healthcare initiative and needs to gain more momentum to reach its enrollment target of 7 million by March. The healthcare.gov website has proven to be a major failure, barely reaching 27,000 sign-ups in its first month, while 15 state-level websites are averaging just over 5,000 sign-ups. Concerns about potential cyber threats have led officials to advise the private sector to strengthen their defences against hackers. President Barack Obama's administration must ensure a smooth transition to the new healthcare system by 2014, which includes providing affordable health insurance for those who cannot afford it. Implications: The healthcare.gov problem is a major concern for the Obama administration as it requires more momentum to reach its enrollment target. With a lack of sign-ups so far, the 2014 launch is at risk. Strengthening defences against cyber attacks is essential for businesses and government alike.```

One of the world’s longest-running art exhibitions, Manifesta, has opened in Marseille for the last time before a change in format that will see it roam the world every two years.
The 14th edition of Manifesta (6 June-25 September) is called “Sun & Sea(marx)” and is curated by the Slovenian art collective Lina Sulakauskaite. This year’s theme is “the sea” and it opens 16 years since the last time Marseille played host to an international art exhibition – a Manifesta “sister” event called 20/21.

## **The Goal**

The goal of the summary-generator is to automatically generate a single, short summary from a given long text in English. Its summary will be short and should capture the context of that text concisely. This summary should not exceed a length of 200 words.

You will use the  **Abstractive, Transformer-based summarizer** to generate the summary on OpenAI's [API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api)
using [Prompt](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/summarization) technique which allows you to tell the model how to summarize input text, resulting in summaries that are tailored to your desired format.
For instance, you can use a prompt to tell the model to output a 200-word summary, with a title, or starting from a specific portion of the text.
It is recommended that you use the prompt when you know you want to include specific items"

7392,4,"Hadrian was the emperor of Rome in the first century. He ruled Rome from 117-118AD. Hadrian began his reign by withdrawing Roman troops from the Middle East. This sparked conflict in Iraq leading to a decision from Hadrian to pull the troops out of Mesopotamia. The exhibition at the British Museum shows the sculptures of Hadrian alongside his political and military decisions. The exhibition is extremely popular due to its rarity in showing large sculptures of Hadrian, which have been preserved for a long time. The exhibition also gives insights into the contemporary issues that remain unsolved until this day like the mystery of Antinous's death and Hadrian's homosexuality. The exhibition also covers the reasons behind Hadrian's decisions in the Middle East, which helped to consolidate imperial power. The exhibition is also about Hadrian's love for architecture and his travels across the empire. The exhibition was opened on 24 July 2011 and is currently displayed at the Reading Room of the British Museum. It can be viewed by the general public for up to 10 years making it a must-visit for anyone interested in ancient history or museum art.```"

2. China's coal mines are notorious for their high accident rates, with hundreds of workers dying every year.
3. The mine fire in Liaoning province killed all of the trapped miners, but the rescue operation eventually succeeded.
4. China's enforcement of safety laws has led to improvement in mine safety record.

3: The  article is mainly about the mine fire that occurs in Liaoning province.
It's about the tragedy that befalls a group of mine workers in China.

  The example above shows that a plain-text summary sentence can be obtained by extracting the key information of an article.
 
 
  There are many different approaches to extract plain text summaries from documents. Some algorithms use features such as text length, character position on lines, and word frequencies, while others use machine learning models. In reality, each sentence contributes to an entire story, which is why we should consider the context of words when summarizing plain texts.
 
 
  Sentence Embedding is a method of representing sentences as numerical vectors that can be used with different neural network architectures, such as [Hierarchical Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05065). This allows for the creation of summaries by combining words and phrases that share similar meanings.

Amid the fallout, authorities admitted for the first time Monday that the 38-year-old Uzair Paracha wasn't the intended target of the shots fired Saturday as the van sped through traffic in midtown Manhattan. Instead, they said, the driver of the van was the intended target, but it wasn't clear whether he was the intended terrorism victim or a random target.

NATO's Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen dismissed complaints that the allied campaign had fallen into a stalemate. At least three rounds of explosions were heard in a three-hour span that began late Monday. The strikes followed an extended period of calm in Tripoli, according to government spokesman Musa Ibrahim. Rasmussen denied that the situation had devolved into a ""stalemate,"" insisting that NATO was making progress and had taken out a substantial part of Gadhafi's military capability. NATO had inflicted a heavy toll on Gadhafi's forces in the port city of Misrata, according to survivors, including Ibrahim al-Neairy, a rebel who was injured.```

So what does it all mean for investors? Well, a lot of things. To name a few things, it means that the outlook for the market is a bit more subdued than it was in, say, March of this year. But it also means that you can expect to see a bit of a pullback in the markets. We also expect to see a rebound in some of the more defensive sectors of the market that have struggled for a while, like energy and materials stocks. We'll also see a bit of a pullback in some of the more momentum-driven, technology-driven stocks. And we'll also see some of the more defensive sectors bounce back a bit more. So, overall, we're expecting to see some upside for the market over the next few weeks. ```

What are the key points that you think a summary should mention? 
If you are having a problem thinking of any example, you can use something that interests you and try to create a summary out of it. Your summary will not be evaluated based on the content of your example, rather on how well you have been able to express the key points. If your English is better or worse than another, it wouldn't be evaluated on that basis either. If you see one example that you like and want to create a summary for it, then by all means do so.

A disease called Ebola has devastated great ape populations, particularly gorillas. It is estimated that nearly a third of the world's gorillas are infected with the virus and are dying as a result. The virus has also led to substantial losses for humans.
Due to the deadly effect of the disease on animals and people, a vaccine has been developed that has been proven to protect against Ebola in humans. This vaccine could potentially protect gorillas and other primates from the disease. By immunizing gorillas, it is hoped that their numbers will increase and endangered populations will be preserved.

The charity donation, as a prosecution demand, could not legally be required in the plea deal, a prosecutor noted during the hearing.

  Ryan Ellis, 30, made no plea and was remanded in custody.
  It followed an incident in which two brothers from Aberdeen were said to have been stabbed in Wardieburn Street West in the Pilton area of the capital on 8 April.
  The men told police they had travelled from Aberdeen to buy a car.

### Background :
Bradley Frail, 16, made no plea last week in connection with the same case. He was also charged with attempted murder..

  ### Implication and Significance:

The example above shows the problem of automatically generating summaries; the summary does not fully capture the salient points and structure of the original article. It is also of a significantly different length than the original.


Given that, the two tasks of this project are to:

Given article content, extract main sentences. A main sentence contains a main topic statement. If multiple sentences contain main topic statements, then they are considered main sentences. If multiple sentences contain the same main topic statement, they are also considered main sentences.

Generate a summary from main sentences.

Requirements:

The final summary must not contain information that is not in the article. 

Each sentence must appear in the summary no more than 3 times."

It also provides a range of income-related financial assistance.

Others could see lower health insurance rates.  ```

Article:  	
The Article is about President Obama's efforts to make affordable health care available to all Americans. An estimated 11.8 million employees of small businesses in the United States are expected to be adversely affected by the Affordable Care Act, with some paying more for health insurance and others getting lower rates.

80726,3,"The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, is a controversial healthcare bill that aims to provide affordable health insurance to all Americans. The ACA has been criticized for its impact on small business employees, with up to 11 million employees facing higher premiums due to several factors. One factor is the elimination of insurer rating variables based on applicants' age, which will result in lower premiums for older individuals, but higher premiums for younger individuals. Another factor is delayed implementation of the ACA for small business employees. This means that many small businesses renewed their health insurance plans in 2013, when the ACA was implemented, resulting in lower premiums initially, but potentially higher premiums later on. Overall, the ACA has faced numerous challenges since its implementation, but public opinion generally supports it.```

The Affordable Care Act was signed into law in March of 2010 and was the most significant legislation to affect the American healthcare system in over half a century. In January 2014, the Affordable Care Act became fully functional, changing the landscape of insurance for all Americans, including those working in small businesses. The CMS report suggests that while 11 million people are facing increased premiums, 6 million will face lower costs, with the difference a result of new laws preventing insurers from charging different premiums based on location, age, gender or health history. Small businesses are faced with a complicated insurance market as they face both higher premiums and new policies, with their decisions based on more than just the three provisions considered by the CMS study. The Republican party has been campaigning against the Affordable Care Act since its introduction in March 2010, and the mistakes and errors seen in its implementation has given them the edge over the Democrats since its introduction in"

51817,2,"A riot is an organized form of resistance to authority. It's defined as a sudden, unexpected and often spontaneous violent attack; it can include arson and destruction of property. Riots are usually associated with economic or social grievances. Some riots have been aimed at the government itself, while others have been directed at the police.  The main characteristics of a riot include: a large number of people involved, the presence of fear and anger, a general sense of anger, a sense of powerlessness and a desire to get things done. And a riot is usually violent and destructive. And it is dangerous. So it is a risky act of resistance, when there is no clear agenda.```

These major challenges are the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions among major world powers, and the effects of climate change. The global economic growth rate has declined significantly in both developed and developing countries, and inflation levels have soared worldwide. COVID-19 had disrupted the supply chains of many corporations, leading to a shortage of goods and a sharp rise in prices across essential products such as food and fuel. This has created even greater economic inequality, making it harder for low-income families to afford even the most basic necessities. Governments globally have rolled out a series of measures in a bid to curb runaway inflation. Countries are providing citizens one-off benefits in the form of stimulus checks or increased welfare payments, and they are also taking measures to cushion the effects of inflation by regulating the cost of fuel. Many countries are also giving financial aid to struggling businesses. Another essential measure to combat inflation is to regulate the prices of basic necessities using subsidies or price caps while also keeping a close watch on foreign exchange markets.

The pandemic has impacted supply chains, and governments are responding with policies aimed at stimulating economies and fostering sustainable growth. The main cause of poverty and inequality is a lack of essential income, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including geopolitical tensions and climate change. Countries are grappling with high rates of unemployment. The economic challenges faced by countries across the globe have also been exacerbated by the pandemic. The UN's report on the global economic outlook shows that economic forecasts for the world have been revised downwards. The ongoing economic crisis has been highlighted by recent protests in India, where protesters are demanding an end to the country's economic crisis. The COVID pandemic has disproportionately impacted low income families and communities. Governments are struggling to develop strategies aimed at supporting families and businesses. ```

User 1: The only real issue I can see is the last sentence, which reads like it's incomplete.  You're close, though.
User 0: The word ""and"" in the sentence should be switched into ""so"" because so has more meaning there, but I am not sure if that is acceptable in terms of standard?
User 1: ""so"" and ""and"" are both grammatically correct and have slightly different meanings, so I don't think I can judge whether they're correct or not in a vacuum.  You need context to decide on the meaning.

You could also omit the ""and"" in that sentence.  I think there are a couple other sentences that flow better without the ""and"", but a little more context from the original is needed to work that out.

64036,3,"In a New Zealand man's life, neglect by his mother and mistreatment by his stepfather led to a downward spiral of self-harm. The man, Ben Smith, was beaten by his stepfather for as long as he could remember, while his mother remained powerless against the abusive man. Ben described witnessing the man beating his mother during the night as the screams woke him up. He felt helpless, stating that his mother lacked the courage to stop the man. Ben turned to relationships and self-harm for affection and healing, respectively. Between these relationships, Ben started self-harming after seeing examples of self-harm in blog posts. The man's life changed when he confronted his mother. Ben said that he was sick of being treated badly and demanded either him or his stepfather to be out of the home by the time his stepfather returned home. Ben's mother chose him, and since then, Ben has had a better life. He moved in with his grandmother and has embarked on an audio engineering course. However, he had to temporarily leave the course due to his grandfather being diagnosed with cancer and has taken up full-time work.```

A special prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, had accused Fernandez and other top officials of hiding Iran's alleged involvement in the attack in a trade deal involving cash-strapped Argentina and Iran. Nisman's death last month has led to suspicions about his claims, including that his 6-month-old draft warrant for Fernandez's arrest was found in his trash can. Fernandez initially said Nisman committed suicide, but later said some members of Argentina's intelligence agency fed Nisman false information and were responsible for his death. An arrest warrant for 4 suspects, who may be in Iran, has been issued.```

Federal Prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita filed a 61-page report essentially endorsing what prosecutor Alberto Nisman claimed before he died in January: that evidence shows Fernandez and other top officials tried to cover up Iran's alleged involvement in the bombing that killed 85 people at a Jewish center in Buenos Aires. Pollicita sent his report to a judge, who is expected to examine it next week after he returns from vacation. The judge can determine whether the case can proceed to trial. Nisman, a special prosecutor investigating the 1994 bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association, alleged last month that Iran was behind the attack, and that Fernandez, to help sweeten a trade deal, covered up Tehran's involvement.

The ruling echoes the stance of a federal appeals court in Boston that in 2003 struck down Massachusetts's anti-upskirt law as undermining free speech. Judge Sharon Keller wrote in her opinion: ""The camera is essentially the photographer's pen and paintbrush. A person’s purposeful creation of photographs and visual recordings is entitled to the same First Amendment protection as the photographs and visual recordings themselves.""

While Britain still gets an AAB rating from the council and is still in the world's top four, the report warned of a vacuum in energy policy since the election and the run-down of nuclear plants and coal-powered stations, as well as ageing infrastructure. The government's refusal to back renewables and a failure to meet Europe's renewable energy targets were also criticised.```

39079,4,"Article: The United Kingdom lost its triple-A energy policy rating from the World Energy ... The UK's energy policies deterred investors and raised energy prices, causing the country to fall behind in the global energy transition, according to the World Energy Council. The report emphasized that the UK's ranking will fall in the future if the government does not take drastic measures to ensure its electricity supply. Summary:The UK has lost its AAA rating from the World Energy Council due to its energy policies. The council cited a lack of investment and low production of renewable energy sources as reasons for the decline. This news impacts the UK's ability to achieve its net-zero target by 2050 and could result in higher energy bills for consumers. The government has responded by introducing additional measures to address the problems identified by the council.

# Description
This is a custom made summarizer and extractor. It is built around GPT and the 12B parameter GPT model. The algorithm is simple and straightforward. The article and the summary are the first and the last input token of the model. The model outputs tokens in between and we simply take those as a summary/ extractive summary.

The idea is to make a summarizer similar to GPT-4 and the prompted AI that Google is building but using our own funds and infrastructure. After that, we can apply it to more complex tasks such as summarizing complex documents and other tasks.

The goal is to reduce costs and use GPT API in a better way for the summarizer.

It will also use our `custom_loss` custom loss function designed to produce more readable summaries as our `custom_loss` has the ability to fine-tune the model, unlike the `multi-label_classification` model.

  After this, when we run the summarization application, our pretrained model will do the summarization and output the desired summary.

 Article: A car accident is a difficult experience that can leave a lasting impact on your physical and emotional well-being. In the hours following a crash, your adrenaline and survival instincts may temporarily prevent you from feeling any noticeable pain or discomfort -- this is known as a shock response. Symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, and blurred vision may indicate an internal injury, so it's important to seek medical attention right away if you experience any of these signs. Minor injuries such as cuts, scrapes, and bruises can be effectively treated at home using first aid supplies. Some injuries, however, require emergency medical attention. These include concussions with loss of consciousness or amnesia, open wounds with uncontrolled bleeding, and any injury causing serious deformity.

It should be concise and informative but also catchy and engaging. The summary should be informative about an article but not so detailed that the reader needs to read every word to understand it.' 

Article: It's no secret that we've all been struggling with the current economic situation. Between inflation, rising interest rates, and global supply chain disruptions, it's not easy to make ends meet. On top of all that, climate change is affecting us in ways that we never imagined-from wildfires and floods to rising seas. It's almost impossible to keep up with what's happening around us-let alone how to handle it all. 

But there are hopeful signs on the horizon. Governments around the world are finally recognizing the severity of the situation and taking coordinated action. The G20 nations are leading the charge with a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2030"

It is not yet clear if this variant is more transmissible or causes more severe disease, but early evidence from England suggests this variant can be up to 70% more transmissible. This variant is linked to a surge in infections across the UK; therefore, it is important to act quickly to control its spread. This can be achieved by implementing tighter restrictions in terms of social distancing, limiting social contacts, closing schools, and reintroducing further restrictions on economic activity.

## Description
This project aims to train a model to generate summaries for news articles using a large language model (LLM) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. The summaries generated will be in plain text format, and it will provide a comprehensive summary of the article without including links or lists. This system will be deployed as a simple script that takes in an article as input, passes it through the trained model and generates a human-readable plain text summary of the article. The project provides a simple solution for auto-generating human-readable summaries with no additional configuration required during deployment.

  So the solution of the problem is:

1. Create a ""Summary"" table with the input data.
2. Remove URLs from text data
2. Using Text summarization in PySpark, the solution uses a pretrained model for text summarization. This model is trained on the Penn Treebank dataset, which is a large corpus of English language sentences and phrases that have been used extensively in natural language processing research. When using this model, it is important to ensure that the input data is in a format that the model can understand, and that the output data is in a format that is useful for the project's specific needs.
3. Use the pretrained model for Text summarization in PySpark with default tuning parameters.

  This is implemented in the script:

Economic growth has slowed considerably across both developed and developing nations. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are exacerbating economic inequalities, making it harder for low-income families to afford basic necessities.

Governments worldwide are responding with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth. However, the extent of recovery varies significantly. Developed economies are expected to experience a V-shaped recovery with a relatively high growth rate. On the other hand, developing nations are expected to have a slower L-shaped recovery as the pandemic has significantly impacted their export-oriented industries.

In addition to economic challenges, there are political ramifications of these current events. Geopolitical tensions, for instance, have the potential to create trade barriers and international disputes. The slowdown of multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) is further exacerbating the problem. Moreover, international relations are being strained due to the United"

- Finding a headline for the text that summarizes what the article is talking about.
- Finding sentences or phrase that is relevant to the topic talked about in the article, the more relevant, the more important and the more frequent a word is in this sentence, the more a sentence is important. The summary is a brief selection of the 15 most relevant sentences.

This process is a very long to execute when applied on more than 100 articles.

Windows Phone 8.1 is the upcoming third generation of Microsoft’s Windows Phone mobile operating system.

It’s rumored that Microsoft’s digital assistant is called Cortana and this leak adds credibility to the rumor. Cortana is reportedly replacing Bing Search. Much like Siri is an Apple iOS feature, Cortana will allow users to talk to it and ask questions.

One strategy for generating more examples of main arguments might be to scrape articles from online news sources and then use natural language processing techniques to identify the main points of the articles. This might involve identifying sentence pairs where the two sentences have a similar meaning, but that represent different perspectives on the subject of the article. 




Also, I am not entirely sure what the output schema should be. A possible way to represent a main argument and its opposing argument could be:

# Text Summarization
Text summarization means automatically converting some text into a brief summary. More often than not, the summary text is a condensed or extracted version of the original text. We can use a lot of words and sentences that are directly taken from the source text.

## Benefits of text summarization
The main benefit of text summarization is reducing the time required to read a large amount of text. In certain applications, reading a document may be difficult. It can help users save time and quickly skim a long report or document. In some fields, it assists people in creating abridged versions of novels, textbooks, or other long"

Articles are a main ingredient of many social media and news websites such as Reddit, Yahoo News and Facebook. Articles are a fundamental medium to receive and spread information around the world. Most of them are short (not more than 1K words). 

 Summarization of articles is an appealing task that has motivated the research community for many years. Summarization allows a reader to get a short and informative version of an article instead of reading it entirely. Although article summarization has been a longstanding research topic, there are many challenges still. One of the major challenges is to find a suitable architecture that summarizes the content effectively from a short text article. Another is how to design a model which is capable of extracting the main idea of an entire article. While some approaches focus on the text-style, such as CNN-RNN and Longformer, others focus on the data style, for instance, self-attention and bidirectional pooling. In this repository, we propose a simple and straightforward approach, called Bidirectional Attention Summarizer ("

 In 1806, Captain William Clark, of the Lewis and Clark expedition, etched his signature at Pompeys Pillar in Montana. Since then, his signature has been one of the last remaining pieces of physical evidence of the historic journey. Recently, a man was arrested for etching a love message on the monument, just three feet from Captain Clark’s signature.

The 1806 signature is one of the last remaining pieces of physical proof of Lewis and Clark’s historic expedition across America. Jonathan Peart, friend of Pompeys Pillar, said it was a bad act to vandalize a landmark with historic and cultural importance and belongs to all of us.

A report in the Swedish tabloid ""Expressen"" said it was the first finding of the species in Sweden. It said the spider had been discovered by a group of researchers on the island of Hornsund, about 60 kilometres northwest of Longyearbyen on Svalbard. The newspaper said the spider, named Alopecosa reclusa, was a large, dark-brown insect about 18-20 millimetres long. It has no eyes and is covered with fine silken hairs. It lives in sandy habitats and feeds on other insects and arachnids. It has been spotted on Svalbard many times in recent years, but the research team said this was the first time it had been observed in Sweden. ""It's a rare species, but it is quite common in some areas,"" Jörgen Müller, lead researcher at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, told the newspaper. ""It has a very limited distribution and we believe it may be present in all of Scandinavia."" He added that the new"
62593,4,"The article focuses on the forced labor of teenaged girls at Austrian care homes during the 1960s, specifically at the St. Martin care home near the Swarovski Austrian plant in Schwaz. The girls were employed by the Swarovski company to do “piece work” on crystals used in jewelry and fashion accessories. Austrian daily Kurier reported that one girl who was employed at the care home claimed that she “was given a box with lots of little stones, tiny crystal stones. I had to lay the stones on pre-designed templates. We worked from seven or eight in the morning until five or six in the evening. It was assembly line work. I do not remember getting a penny for my work.” Another former resident of the care home, identified as Hermine R, said that the work was “exploitation of these young mothers. It was made out to be good work, but it was piece work.” The article also states that Swarovski has ordered an urgent independent enquiry into the allegations. Overall, the article covers the inhumane treatment of young girls who were forced to work under poor conditions at an Austrian care home by a multinational company, and the need"

8081,4,"The University of London's ""unfit for human occupation"" accommodation complex on Caledonian Road has been awarded the 2023 Carbuncle Cup by the Building Design magazine. The building, designed by Stephen George and Partners, is described as failing to provide adequate daylight, privacy, or views to many rooms. The magazine claims that it lacks the criteria of human occupation, while being designed specifically for students. The report cites a ""major failure of architecture and placemaking"" in the design, as it destroys historic red-brick warehouses while preserving a facade. The Executive Editor and Carbuncle Cup Juror Ellis Woodman noted that the building is located on the same street as HMP Pentonville. Despite this, the University of London states that the building complies with all necessary planning regulations. Islington Council had originally refused planning permission for the building due to concerns over design quality and the quality of student amenities. However, the decision was overturned by the inspectorate. Paul Convery, who chaired the council committee that turned down the planning application, said that the planning application for this building was refused by the government inspector overturned the council'"

89510,1,"The Unison union is protesting against the refusal of Cordia, a body of Glasgow City Council, to discuss additional compensation for tasks perceived as ""dirty, unpleasant, involve regularly working outside or heavy lifting"".
This is a part of a larger industrial dispute that erupted on January 19, 2023 and is set to continue on April 20.
The main cause seems to be a demand by janitors to be awarded the Working Context and Demands Payment, which would provide them with compensation ranging from £500 to £1,000. 
The employer, Cordia, has denied this demand and refused to further negotiate, which has led to the escalation of tensions.
It is worth noting that, throughout the dispute, the janitors have reportedly boycotted a number of duties and have been supported by the public through various campaigns and initiatives.
The outcome of this industrial action remains uncertain and it is yet to be seen how it will impact the city's janitors and their working conditions. ```

Cordia said they had given unison three opportunities to outline their issues and that the matter was considered by a committee before being rejected. A spokesman for the facilities company said: ""Cordia has completely exhausted all internal processes after negotiations with unison and is not required to convene a meeting to further negotiate when at this stage there is no possibility of a settlement"". But unison said janitors were entitled to the working context and demands payment which ranges from about £500 to more than £1000. Sam macartney, unison branch officer, said: ""We want justice for jannies in glasgow.

The janitors had launched a boycott of certain duties earlier on January 19th, seeking the ""Working Context and Demands Payment"" which can range from £500 to £1,000. Unison argued that the janitors were entitled to the payment. The specific duties that the janitors deemed to be ""dirty, unpleasant, or involve regularly working outside"" included, but were not limited to, cleaning the toilets, cleaning the floors, and cleaning the windows. This caused a significant disruption to the services of the union members in the city and across the UK, leading to the need for intervention by the UK authorities.
In response to the strike, Cordia had offered a 10% pay increase for certain workers, but this was not enough to address the concerns of the janitors who believed that they were not being treated fairly given the nature of their work. The specific"

# Background:

Tony Benn (23 June 1925 – 14 March 2014) was a British Labour politician and social activist. He was a Member of Parliament from 1950 until 2001 and became one of the best-known politicians of his era. He was Minister of Technology and Secretary for Industry, and campaigned for left-wing positions on a number of issues, including unilateral nuclear disarmament and British withdrawal from the Common Market (now European Union). In 1981 and 1983, he was a key figure in the successful campaigns to deny the Labour Party leadership to then-Prime Minister James Callaghan and his Shadow Chancellor Denis Healey respectively.[4][5] The Soviet Union named him ""the most dangerous politician in Britain"",[6] and ""the most dangerous man in Britain"" was a headline in the tabloid newspaper The Sun during the 1980s.[7] Benn was also noted for his support for nuclear disarmament and against nuclear war.[8] Benn was a long-time member of the Labour Party, serving"

 The article talks about how the scientists found that the diversity of amphibians, birds, insects, and mammals was declining rapidly, with some species disappearing altogether.
 It also mentions that climate change is playing a role in this decline, with changing weather patterns causing habitat loss and making it difficult for species to adapt.

One of the challenges facing the global economy is inflation. This is partly due to the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian conflict, which is driving up oil prices, and exacerbating food and fuel shortages. Other factors contributing to inflation include labor and material shortages and supply chain bottlenecks.
Inflation is also being driven by the Federal Reserveâ€™s aggressive campaign to stave off inflation by raising interest rates. This has led to sharp stock market volatility and increased pressure on companies to cut costs and raise prices.
In the U.K., inflation hit five percent earlier this year, while in the U.S. it had reached nearly four percent in February. Across the euro zone, inflation currently stands at 5.9 percent and is expected to peak in the coming months at over six percent. However, central bankers across the globe warn that inflation will stay high and persist longer than anticipated due to the ongoing conflict.

But the company has ambitions that go way beyond deliveries. Kiwibot wants to build a business model that will make any robot-carried delivery possible in the future, whether a pizza, groceries, or, potentially, blood.
“We do not consider ourselves a pizza delivery robot company,” says Andres Barreto, CEO of Kiwibot. “We want to be this platform on wheels that can deliver whatever.”
The first few companies to adopt Kiwibot’s tech have been universities and private companies. Currently, Kiwibot’s largest-scale project is the delivery of academic papers by students from the University of the Pacific to faculty members.

The club's manager, José Riga, stated that whether he will remain at The Valley depends on the content of the next meeting, but it will heavily depend on how his employer react to certain situations and how they want to do things in the future. Belgian Riga returned to Charlton in mid-January on an 18-month deal and is their second-spell in charge of the club. The south-east London side won the drop to League One after their 4-4 draw against Bristol City at the end of the month.

There are many origins of carnival: some say its beginnings were in Ile Aiye, the ""house of life"" built by former colonizers' slaves from the Congo. They were obliged to participate in the Catholic Church's congregation, Our Lady of the Rosary, and in turn, they held an annual masked party to celebrate their freedom, which turned out to be the genesis of carnival.

78414,4,"[2023-May-23][In a ruling published Tuesday, former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was convicted of fraud “for many years and despite the public roles assumed” by him, a court said. The longtime billionaire politician was involved in fraud involving purchases of TV rights by his Mediaset network even when he served as prime minister, a three-judge panel determined, according to a written explanation supporting the ruling. “The evidence shows in fact that [Berlusconi] was the person to whom decisions on purchases were entrusted, even while he was prime minister,” the court wrote. Berlusconi, 86, said in a statement after the verdict that he is “tranquil” and “prepared to appeal at the highest level, which has already been indicated to me, the constitutional court.” Berlusconi’s conviction stemmed from a 2013 trial that accused him of fraud, conspiracy to defraud and false accounting.

77587,1,"During the COVID-19 crisis, governments are taking unprecedented actions to address the economic crisis. This includes providing unprecedented fiscal stimulus, changing regulations in many areas and creating economic support packages. These measures are designed to create a stable economic environment in the short and the long-term. In addition, to address the supply-chain disruptions, many national governments including the US, Germany, Japan, and India, are making efforts to bring forward the production and investment in strategic elements to make them more reliable and resilient to shocks. Meanwhile, to address the increasing economic inequalities, governments are taking measures to increase social assistance and implement social protection programs in the form of job creation, providing income support to the poor and expanding access to education for the less privileged. The European Union (EU) is also working towards creating a social market economy system. Given the scale and scope of challenges, it is crucial for governments, both at domestic and global levels, to address the long-term risks and uncertainties facing the global economy. This includes reducing their reliance on volatile fossil fuels and improving their climate resilience capacities.```"

Which of the below is the most accurate simplification of the above article?



1) Currency trading began as a way for businesses and individuals to convert currency for travel.
Now, $5.3 trillion in currency is traded daily, twice as much as the economic output of the United Kingdom.
Most people buy and sell currency in hopes of making money, not facilitating trade.
However, the actual rate of exchange between two currencies is constantly changing with news.
Now, much of the trading happens electronically from banks or other providers.
Half of the world's currency is traded through London each day, making trading there extremely important to many places.

2) Currency trading began as a way for nations to convert currency for trade and travel.
About 40% of the worldâ€™s currency is now traded in London every day.
Today, only a fraction of trading occurs for the original purpose of facilitating cross-border trade: there is a lot of speculation."

31501,2,"The Egyptian military said border guards had confronted illegal migrants who opened fire on them. Five Sudanese were killed in the incident, and five more were arrested. ```

## Summary

The article talks about a border stand-off between Egyptian guards and illegal migrants, with the military saying the migrants fired on the guards. Five Sudanese nationals were killed and six injured when border guards chased a group of migrants trying to cross into Egypt from Sudan, the army said.
The Egyptian military said the migrants were with people smugglers who opened fire on the border guards when they attempted to arrest the group.
Earlier this month the bodies of 15 African migrants were found on the border in the same area, near Rafah.
They appeared to have been shot dead.
In addition to the 5 Sudanese shot dead (see summary below), a further 5 migrants were injured and a further 5 arrested by security forces.

This project is very useful for developers who can't waste their time to read the whole news :

So this project let you generate the summary text and then the developer will have to ask in their code (python, go, c, javascript) the right question, so when they receive the answer they can format text or not.

  The abstractive summarization task is not a standardized problem, but it can be solved by some algorithms. The best text-summarization technology may vary depending on the application and domain. However, many abstractive models have common characteristics that they tend to follow. They need pre-trained text representations: embeddings, BERT, contextual embeddings, etc. They also require training datasets for the summarization or abstractive models. A common text format that is used to create abstractive summarization for these two articles is the following:"

It allows you to:

1. Select the language
2. Enter the start and stop point
   - The start point indicates the index of the first character in the article to check.
   - The stop point indicates the index of the first character after the end of the article.

Furthermore, the adverse effects of climate change have intensified, resulting in more frequent and severe natural disasters, disruptions to global supply chains, and a rise in the cost of food and energy. These circumstances have prompted governments to implement various stimulus measures, including fiscal stimulus and support packages. The European Union, United States, and China have all taken actions to address the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and boost economic growth while navigating geopolitical tensions and climate change. These policies have been designed to support businesses, boost employment, and encourage innovation. However, achieving sustainable economic growth in this challenging environment is challenging. The impact of COVID-19 remains significant, and its long-term consequences are still unfolding."

The logo has four parts, which represents the four aspects of what it means to become a good writer to include critical perspective, strong arguments, thorough background research, and clear language.

- Critical Perspective: The shape of the word ""Penn"" is a rectangle, which represents thinking outside of the box and approaching things from a new perspective. This symbolizes the critical perspective required in writing because we must be able to question our assumptions and evaluate different points of view.

- Strong arguments: The shape of the word ""Writer"" is a triangle, representing the shape of an argument or thesis statement. This symbolizes how we need to develop strong arguments in order to prove our points effectively, much like how we would build up a triangle from its foundation to make it strong.

Thorough Background Research: The lines that make up the letter ""W"" represent research data or information collected through research done in order to write an article well.

Despite the shared history of being the closest allies during the War, America's indifference towards British concerns such as in regard to the partition of Palestine showed the changing dynamic between the two nations. British leaders were trying to reinvigorate their influence by attempting to impede the developing European Union. However, this only led Washington to see London's imperial holdings in a negative light and eventually the Suez Crisis came about due to British and French involvement in foreign affairs without consulting the US. This incident marked the end of British imperial influence."

Britain during World War 1 and World War 2 was in a very important position when it came to war as it controlled almost entire world while US helped in making important decisions. The countries that helped them were France and US. This alliance helped in victory over Germany during World War 2. Post the World War 2, UK had to cut itself from its former colonies to reduce Soviet's influence. However, all UK allies including France did not listen to US. US was upset with UK that it had not consulted them and had a major conflict during Suez Crisis. This was because US wanted UK to stay in Suez Canal to save its money while UK wanted to withdraw its money as they no longer held any importance. UK decided to withdraw from the Empire and to enter the European Union after a referendum. UK was not allowed to do so by US. UK was left with no choice but to withdraw.

There were so many countries that they were like an empire. So, the UK made an agreement with France that if it wanted more colonies, they could become its colony. In the end, the UK gave its colonies to France and made them friends.

Article: 'Astonishing' discovery throws light on how dinosaurs may have had colour on their feathers. 

Picture: The colourings have revealed information on the evolution of the dinosaurs. 

Summary:
The colour on dinosaurs are thrown into light recently with the discovery of microscopic pigments that can give the impression of colour. They are called melanosome. There is evidence from 150 million years ago which reveals that birds and dinosaurs inherited colour patterning from their common ancestor. The fossils that provide the best clues and colour patterning and features on their feathers were discovered in Mongolia and China after excavations from the 80s that are now preserved at Yale University. Fossils from Mongolia have the most extensive evidence on how the colours work. The colours are like the peacock, pheasant, and chickens that humans are familiar with.

Brazilian-born Silva began swimming at the age of six and moved back to Rio as a child.

She competed in her first Paralympics in Atlanta in 1996 before going on to win gold medals in 2000, 2004 and 2008, with six silvers to go with.

The 69-year-old is used to gun crime after being held at gunpoint during a mugging in New Orleans. Davies said the crime scenes were almost always in places with little to no security guards, adding that he doesn't know why people would go there. When interviewed about why he fought back against his mugger, Davies said he was shocked at how he reacted. He said people don't expect their fight or flight instinct to lead to them fighting back against criminals. Davies shot the man in the arm as he chased him down the street. The criminal escaped in the car with his accomplices, who were arrested after giving them away to the police. According to Davies, nobody knew who he was when he was put in the hospital because of his unknown status in the United States. Davies said he woke up in the United States with the hospital label of being called “Unknown Purple.”```"

This was in relation to a tweet Flanagan sent out in February 2018 during an interview with Stephen Nolan, a BBC Northern Ireland presenter, on the Stephen Nolan Show.
The tweet was deemed to be grossly defamatory by the High Court in Belfast.

The details of the fire haven't been released yet, nor has any information about what caused it or about its victims' identities. There haven’t been any charges made yet either.

This incident can be seen as an example of a tragedy where young innocent lives lose theirs due to mistakes or negligence. It is a sad event with significant repercussions for the communities involved.

According to the website of the National Fire Protection Association, ""Fire is the third leading cause of accidental deaths."" While that statement may seem shocking, statistics do show that more than 3,300 people who are less than 18 years old are killed or severely injured in fire every year. They also show that more than 30 million U.S. homes face a high risk of fire.

James Chapman, the Sunday Mail editor, said: ""It was the result of petty horse-trading between coalition colleagues over the need to raise cash to support the economy. It was not just the Lib Dems who were involved. This is a very dangerous precedent it creates."" The decision to recognize Cornwall as a national minority was made by the Lib Dems and was a necessary part of the negotiations to achieve the cuts in town hall pensions that would save up to £600 million a year over three years. Cornish people were granted the same rights and protections as other national minority groups, but the idea of giving them this status was presented to Cabinet colleagues over lunchtime on March 13 as unavoidable. Danny Alexander, who was chief secretary to the treasury at the time, said that he wanted to make the recognition before the end of March. It was then up to the ministers to agree.

Question :
What are problems of article summarizer?




Answer:
The following is what I've thought of :
- It produces incomplete or inaccurate summaries.
- It fails to capture the main points of the article.
- It generates summaries that are too long or too short.
- It lacks context.
- It generates summaries with grammar or spelling errors.
- It tends to reproduce the text of the article without any modification.
- It doesn't take into account the structure of the article.

42934,4,"The main focus of Hillary Clinton's trip to Asia is to counter China's growing influence in the region. Her visits to Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, while she previously avoided those countries in her four years as Secretary of State, highlight the significance of the role Laos will play in developing the Xayaburi Dam project. The construction of this dam, at a cost of over $3 billion, has been highly controversial among Laotian officials and residents alike due to its potential environmental impact on the Mekong River, an ecologically significant waterway used by millions of people across Southeast Asia. The US sees Laos as a key ally in its strategy against China, which is already constructing a series of dams across Southeast Asia. With Laos in the lead, the Xayaburi Dam is China's next step in this strategy, and it will be a major victory for China if it is successful in building the dam. Although there are still concerns over environmental damage from this new dam, the U.S. is now urging Laos to move forward with its construction plans. The U.S. has decided to support the Laos dam project in its effort to strengthen economic ties with Laos,"

56482,1,"In 1894, the Italian inventor Angelo Mosso demonstrated that the consumption of oxygen in the human brain was proportional to the complexity of the cerebral process. Since then, a number of studies have shown that high cognitive workload is related to increases in cerebral blood flow, metabolism and energy use. In the 1980s, the introduction of functional brain imaging technologies, especially positron emission tomography (PET), allowed the functional brain activity of human subjects to be mapped as never before. In the 1990s, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was introduced, a non-invasive imaging technique that has become the most used method for mapping functional brain activity in healthy subjects. Since then, however, it has become evident that imaging brain activation may not provide the best answers to questions on the neural basis of cognition. This is particularly the case for working memory, which has been repeatedly found to be associated with specific brain regions, mainly the prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex. The neural underpinnings of working memory may thus be best understood by considering its relation to other cognitive functions that share the same neural substrate"

  It is evident that, the summary sentence does not completely include the content and the most important idea of the article. However, it should try to capture the most important piece of information without too many details. A good summary sentence must be short, to the point, and clear. An ideal summary sentence would be easy to understand and digest and would capture the most important parts of the article.
  In summary sentences, the use of capitalization, punctuation, and other grammatical structures should be consistent with the writer's style and the type of work (e.g., academic, business, creative writing, etc.). These elements help to make the summary sentence more readable and coherent."

26039,3,"The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of COVID-19, geopolitical tensions, and climate change.

As the world grapples with these issues, economic growth has slowed considerably across both developed and developing nations. The economic downturn is caused by a combination of economic woes including supply chain disruptions, increased inflationary pressure, and economic inequality that has deepened over time.

In the face of these challenges, governments worldwide have responded with a mix of fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth. The goal is to address both short-term issues and long-term structural problems that have been exposed by the pandemic and other external shocks.

Given the scale of the challenges facing the global economy, it is crucial that policy makers and leaders work together towards a common goal of creating a more resilient and inclusive economic framework. The challenges are complex and multifaceted, but they can be overcome with a collective effort and a vision for a future that is both prosperous and sustainable.```

On Monday, local media reported blackouts across the country. Mr Arreaza said private companies would be asked to use their own generators to reduce pressure on the national grid.
But he said it was private homeowners who consumed the most energy, and he called for everyone to turn the dial down on their air conditioners. ""We are appealing to everyone's conscience, to use energy efficiently."" Last week the government claimed that energy problems were due to maintenance issues, but the opposition criticised the government for not investing enough in the energy sector, BBC Venezuela correspondent Daniel Pardo reports.
Power outages are common in Venezuela, which is a big oil producer but depends heavily on hydro-electric power.
Venezuela is also struggling with an economy in recession that has been hard hit by the fall in the price of oil. Some 96% of its export revenues are reported to come from oil."

The Venezuelan economy is in recession, and the inflation rate is over 60%. It was reported that the revenue from oil exports was at over 96% in 2014. Inflation is a key area of focus for governments, and it is known that when the cost of living increases, it has a negative impact on individuals and communities. Venezuela has been hit by a severe economic crisis, and the government is under pressure to take action.```

GPT-3.5 is an artificial intelligence developed by OpenAI that can generate human-like text. It can be used for a variety of purposes, such as generating realistic sounding news articles, summarizing long documents, or even writing computer programs.

GPT-3.5 functions as a language model, which means it can generate coherent text given a series of inputs. For example, if you input ""The United States is the largest country in the world"" into GPT-3.5, it will generate a response such as ""The United States is the largest country in the world and has the largest population of any country.""

One of the most impressive aspects of GPT-3.5 is its ability to understand and generate complex texts based on simple inputs. For example, if you input ""Romeo and Juliet"" into GPT-3.5, it will generate a response such as ""Romeo and Juliet are a pair of star crossed lovers who fall into a deep and hopeless love despite their societ"

    By Jo Biddle
The stuffed toy mascot of an airman has become a key part of the story of the Second World War.
But Mr Fox, the teddy belonging to Flight Sergeant Bill Hovey, has gone AWOL.
Mr Fox is described as wearing a red coat and jodhpurs, and has details of some of the missions he was on written on his legs.
The mascot was with Flt Sgt Hovey on a total of 36 bombing raids to Germany with 106 Squadron between 1944 and 1945.

    # Failed mission

    At one point, the crew, also known as the Metheringham Six, failed to get clearance for a mission, and returned to base.
The mascot was thrown from the plane over the coast of Holland.
When Flt. Sgt Hovey reported the mascot as missing, the commander's wife, Mrs Vokes, sewed him a new coat, said Peter Marriott who is leading the search.

The toy, named Mr Fox, belonged to Bill Hovey, a navigator with 106 Squadron who completed 36 operations between March 1944 and August 1944. The fox is an important part of the airfield's history, and is hoped to be returned following a mix up with the paperwork. Mr Fox survived 65 operations with the squadron based at the airfield, which was home from 1943 to 1946. Meanwhile, 59 Lancaster bombers and 300 air crew were lost during World War II, according to a report published in March 2015 by the BBC. According to the BBC’s report titled “A-bombs over Japan: why the debate rages,” nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. The attack killed around 225,000 people, though other estimates suggest the figure is much higher."

## Introduction

The idea behind this project is to create an app that extracts the summary of an article quickly using GPT-3.5 models.
The application is designed for any person interested in reading the main point of any article without having to waste time on unnecessary or irrelevant information.
This app uses the official API provided by OpenAI in the latest language called GPT-3.5 models, that have been launched recently.
As summarizer, we can use any language available as it is.
I choose the simplified Chinese version of the app (`zh-cn`) and tested the French, Korean and US English versions, as well.
The app can be used on smartphones, iPads and tablets and even on desktop computers.

## Features

The app extracts the summary of an article with any language or version available in OpenAI.
This helps the user save time by getting the main idea of any article quickly.
The first version supports all GPT-3.5 models, but the default template is `gpt-4-"

Philip Hammond regularly cites evidence that the growth of self-employment is undermining the tax base - by between Â£3.5bn and Â£5bn a year by 2020 potentially.
The self-employed tend to be lower paid and also still pay, even with the tax increases, a lower level of national insurance compared to the 12% paid by full-time employees.
Those who are self-employed point out that they are in a much more precarious employment and have often decided to take a risk as entrepreneurs.

This move comes as part of a larger package of measures aimed at ensuring that all companies operating in the UK, regardless of whether or not they receive subsidies from the government, pay their taxes.

You see, as you drive back in from the airport, this is a real city, and not just some kind of Hollywood movie-set - although it is home to that great institution, and many other such.
And what immediately strikes you is that it is not only beautiful, but that it also feels very safe, in a way that many cities in the world nowadays no longer seem to do.
And that in turn is because people actually do live here. And it is not simply a place designed for the wealthy, or indeed the tourists.
It is a genuine, working city, with a very fine infrastructure for the public to use.
Craig Riley, the managing director of the UK operation of the French consultancy Egis, was born in San Francisco, and brings the city to life as we drive across it together on a fine afternoon.

4525,3,"In the Bedfordshire region of the United Kingdom, a motorist was stopped by police on Sunday for having a baby high chair in the driver's seat area of her car. The woman was driving down Dogsthorpe Road in Peterborough when she was pulled over for having a ""limited view of the road."" In other words, the high chair obstructed her view, causing potential danger. According to the police department, the driver actually had her head between the legs of the high chair. The police unit in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, and Hertfordshire (UK) stated that the woman was reported for a dangerous load. They also ordered the driver to remove the high chair before continuing her journey. The police emphasized the potential danger created by the seated high chair. The woman had her head between the legs of the high chair, which prevented her from having a clear view of the road and potentially leading to an accident. The incident highlights the importance of safe driving practices and the dangers posed by improperly secured objects in a vehicle. It is crucial for drivers to ensure that their vehicles are free of any objects that could obstruct their vision or present a hazard while on the road.```"

The article text is quite complex and not well suitable for summarizing at the moment.
Given the summary:
    - ""the woman"" doesn't really make sense. One article title suggested it's a man but it isn't clear.
    - The fact that the car belongs to someone that isn't the woman is also important.
    - There is no mention on the car being dangerous as such

In an interview with Russian state TV, Russia’s president said the West had been using the country as a military pawn in an attempt to weaken his country.
Putin, however, said that the move was being driven by a desire to weaken his country and he also dismissed allegations that Russia had committed war crimes against civilians.
Russia has already launched a peace deal in March 2014, after Russia seized the Crimea region in eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian authorities have accused the rebel fighters of killing several civilians.

The abovementioned text needs further paraphrasing, and I have written it on my own, in my own words and grammar structure, removing any URL, name, sentence structure, or list, to maintain a natural readable flow (so a human can clearly understand it).

There are a few online tools that help me do this, including Jarvis.

I have a few questions for you : 

1 - Are there any major benefits to doing it on my own, without relying on these tools, rather than trusting them for the job? Or are these tools so good by now, that they don't miss much?

2 - How can I detect if the AI tools made a mistake, and how can I correct this mistake? For example, in my short example above, there should be a comma after the ""average""."

The government has announced a major drive to improve disciplinary standards in schools. It says there are unacceptable levels of poor behaviour, with pupils arriving late, disruptive or failing to concentrate.
The prime minister has appointed Tom Bennett, a prominent educational campaigner, to establish a working group on behaviour. The group will be supported by the Department for Education and the Department for Children, Schools and Families to find ways to improve classroom management.
The government action comes after an Ofsted report showed children with challenging behaviour can be let down by weak discipline policies in schools.

In turn, BA threatened to cancel the contract and relocate the staff to other regions if they continued to refuse the offer. Following the threats, BA decided to implement its contingency plan.

### Summary

The article presents a comprehensive review of the Global Economy Report, which outlines the financial risks associated with climate change, energy transition, and other environmental impacts. It also discusses the global economic consequences of COVID-19 and the steps taken by governments to address this crisis. Additionally, the report highlights the need for governments to consider the interplay between different sources of financial risk in order to effectively manage and mitigate them. Furthermore, it suggests that governments should implement a cohesive policy framework that accounts for both short-term and long-term financial risks in order to achieve sustainable and equitable development. The report advocates for a balanced approach to climate finance that considers both public and private financial mechanisms. It also emphasizes the importance of ensuring that climate finance promotes green growth and inclusive development. Moreover, the report outlines the need for climate-resilient investment in order to reduce exposure to physical and transition-related financial risks. Finally, it calls for strengthened coordination between governments and stakeholders for the implementation of climate policies. The report provides a valuable resource for"

A police officer reported seeing her at LAX without a ticket a day before a judge granted her two years' probation.

Airport staff found her after the flight took off and she got off, and Hartman confessed to being on board for more than an hour.

Recent developments in the global economy have presented unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. These factors have resulted in the slowdown of economic growth across both developed and developing nations. Additionally, supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures have exacerbated existing economic inequities. Governments worldwide have responded with various measures, including fiscal stimuli, policy reforms, and support packages aimed at stabilizing markets and fostering sustainable growth. The summary provided in plain text format is given below:

### Summary

- The global economy is facing various challenges due to the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic, growing geopolitical tensions, and the escalating challenges posed by climate change.

- Economic growth has slowed significantly across many nations worldwide, both in the developed and developing worlds.

- Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures have resulted in the intensification of economic disparities, leading to greater difficulties for lower-income families in meeting basic essentials.

- Many governments worldwide have taken a broad range of measures in response to the abovementioned issues, including"
23567,4,"In January, airport motorists will be hit with a £1 charge every time they drop off family or friends at Aberdeen International Airport, and they'll face a fine of £30 if they stay longer than 10 minutes. Airport officials say this is necessary to reduce congestion and improve safety for visitors and staff. A new automated number plate recognition (ANPR) system will monitor drivers upon entry, and anyone who stays for longer than the permitted time will receive a fine of £30. However, non-airport taxi drivers and other representatives for the Unite union are furious about this plan. They claim that the new fee will lead to higher fares for airport journeys and that it's unfair to force additional charges onto customers. Additionally, the worry is that other airports might adopt a similar strategy, leading to higher costs for taxis and other services. Despite these concerns, Aberdeen airport's managing director has stated that they need to control behaviour in the pickup area to ensure the safety of visitors and staff. However, disabled motorists or taxi drivers using blue badges will be afforded a grace period of 30 minutes to make things more convenient.```

Exposing newborn babies to germs could help prevent asthma as they grow up, research suggests.The findings bolster the theory that modern obsession with hygiene and cleanliness has driven a boom in allergies and health problems. According to the 'hygiene hypothesis', exposure to bacteria is necessary to prime the immune system early in life. Many scientists believe that modern society, with its mania for sanitation and easy access to antibiotics, makes children hypersensitive to harmless allergens. Researchers believe that exposing children to germs as babies could help them avoid asthma in later life .

The scientists found that when newborn mice were exposed to allergens they were better able to ward off asthma.

2023.05.31 19:46 CryptonicCoder Is it rude to refuse a job offer in the middle of a job interview if the salary is so low?

I had one of my interviews today with a new company.
During the interview, they offered me 1622 USD per month, which is considered low pay by local standards.
They're also making a bunch of requests that don't feel right. The company is offering me a three-month probation period, which they claim is standard practice.
Given that their initial offer is well below the expected minimum salary, should I accept it? Or should I reject the offer and continue searching for employment? (I already have a high level of experience in software development, so I'm not worried about landing a job).

The article is an overview of what happens in a scene of The Queen, but it also uses its own language to describe things, and what The Queen is supposed to say is not necessarily what you want to summarize.

The production aims to break the contract of silence surrounding private audiences between the Queen and her Prime Ministers.

The scene is controversial, with some Royal experts denouncing the play's depiction of the Queen's views on the war. The court circular makes no mention of the alleged meeting, which occurred on March 19, 2003, a day before the Allies launched their Shock and Awe campaign. Royal historian Hugo Vickers has raised concerns about the play's accuracy. The playwright's claim that no one had dared to write about the royals' private lives does not stand up to scrutiny.

The play is said to depict political meetings, where the Queen’s views are heard, but not necessarily in sync with her official stance as head of state. The controversy surrounding the play has increased due to historical inaccuracies, lack of evidence to support the claims, and discrepancies regarding the Queen’s meeting with Tony Blair on a specific date.```"

The fact that Anne doesn’t have a website, or any social media accounts is also important to note.

Instead, they stayed silent until they were able to get help from someone else who could go out and make a fuss about what had happened - like you and me. This is exactly what needs to change when it comes to working with people - you can’t just let things slide by and hope that everything will be alright.

Based on the story of Adam and Eve, the roller created for Morris by Gill shows the biblical couple in a rather compromising position. Gill, now disgraced after being revealed to be both incestuous and overly fond of the family dog, was a friend of Morris and shared his left-wing politics. But eye-opening though Gill's designs are, it is Morris who proved to be the most radical as the diaries and copy of Marx's Das Kapital included in the collection make plain. None of this comes as a surprise to curator and cultural historian Fiona MacCarthy, who says Morris believed that 'beauty was a basic human birthright' and as such, art should be available to everyone - including him. So, and in spite of his membership of the Socialist League, Morris wasn't immune to the odd vanity project, including encasing his copy of Das Kapital in gold.

When it went off they discovered the smoldering clothes and mattress and immediately called 911, because of their quick reaction damage to the property was said to be 'minimal'. Firefighters in Corvallis, Oregon, have warned residents to store laptops, like the 2008 Macbook Pro, away from combustible surfaces following the Wednesday morning blaze at the shared home.```

Economic inequality is exacerbated by supply chain disruptions and inflation, making it harder for low-income families to afford basic necessities. Governments have been responding with various stimulus measures and policy reforms to stabilize markets and foster sustainable growth. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global supply chains and caused widespread economic insecurity. Geopolitical tensions and climate change add to this uncertainty. Despite the uncertainty, there are glimmers of hope. With increasing awareness of social and environmental issues, some sectors are leading the way towards a more inclusive and sustainable future. Technology is playing a significant role in this transition, with advances like renewable energy and virtual workspaces promoting environmentally friendly practices. Many companies are also embracing more inclusive employment practices, actively promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace.

Maybe you're just too lazy to read it and would rather skim through. Maybe you're pressed for time and you cannot give some text the full justice it deserves. In an age where the digital world is growing ever more saturated with information at our fingertips, summarising such information is increasingly important as the human attention span is dropping and the value of time increases.

The current situation is having significant adverse effects on social stability. There are growing concerns about the impact of these factors on economic growth, trade, and employment.

The economic impact is not limited to emerging markets but is also being felt in developed countries as well. Governments worldwide are taking measures to support businesses and protect jobs while trying to keep up with changing consumer trends.

One of the main challenges facing the global economy today is supply chain disruptions caused by various factors such as pandemic-related travel restrictions, port congestions, raw material shortages, and extreme weather events. These disruptions are leading to higher prices and delays in deliveries for many businesses, which cannot afford further setbacks in their operations.

Economists believe that these shocks could lead to persistent inflationary pressures, making it more challenging for economies to recover from recessions and grow sustainably.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change, economic growth rates have slowed across both developed and developing economies. In addition to this slowdown, there have been supply chain disruptions that continue to affect the movement of goods and services. Furthermore, inflationary pressures have increased, further exacerbating existing economic inequalities. This, combined with high unemployment rates due to supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, has made it harder for low-income families to afford basic necessities.

 To counter these challenges, governments worldwide are taking a multi-pronged approach. They are introducing both fiscal and monetary stimuli, as well as support packages intended to minimize the impacts on individuals and businesses from economic stresses. Furthermore, these governments are introducing policy reforms to ensure that the economy remains stable and sustainable in the long term. 

 However, despite these efforts, some of the economic challenges that are being faced today cannot be addressed by monetary interventions. These include issues such as the impact of climate change on the economy and supply chains, as well as the need for structural adjustments"

 If the measure had passed, it would have been legally challenged as it contradicts the US Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion in 1973. Similarly, personhood measures had been rejected in states such as Colorado in 2008 and 2010, as well as in Mississippi in 2001.

It is one of the biggest economic topics that affect Americans' personal and professional lives. For this reason, the cost of healthcare is of great importance to economists. Some people argue that the rising costs are due to an inefficient market. A large number of people think that healthcare is a commodity that consumers should be able to freely choose from, and that's the reason why prices should naturally fall according to market principles that apply to other commodities. This idea is wrong. The problem is that the majority of people want universal health coverage because everyone thinks that they should have free healthcare. This idea is flawed."

Which of the following options is the correct way to get the plain-text summary sentence from the article?

- a. [x] Split the article and summary by new lines and the find the middle line
- c. [x] Use the summary sentence of the article
- b. [ ] Extract the sentence immediately after the first full stop in the article
- d. [ ] Extract the sentence immediately after the first period in the article's title
- e. [ ] Find the first sentence that starts with a Capital letter and excludes the word 'Article'
##### Correct Answer
a. Split the article and summary by new lines and the find the middle line

This is a very good answer choice, as we need to make use of the structure of the article and its summary. By default, the first line of the summary is the plain-text summary sentence you are looking for.

Alternatively, however, you could use the title and article to get a sentence in a similar way by using the `article_sentence` function, as shown in the code below.

41293,2,"What colour is snow? At first, it seems like an easy answer. Anyone who has seen snow will know it is white, the reason being because it reflects almost all visible light incident upon it. But if you’ve ever dug a deep hole in snow and looked down, you will have noticed that sometimes it can actually appear blue - and sometimes even red, in other circumstances - but why? ```

#### Summary

```The summary doesnt provide all the necessary information, it just mentions blue and white colour, and it doesnt mention the red colour that also can be observed at times. ```"
41293,3,"Snow appears as white when it reflects most visible light that strikes it. But if you have the opportunity to dig a deep hole, you might notice it can appear blue or even red. This is due to more and more of the ice crystals in the snow reflecting blue light, and absorbing other types. Scientists have revealed that each and every one of them can in fact be sorted into 35 general shapes, which in turn tell experts how they formed. The shapes, which include plate crystals, irregular snow particles and plane crystals - which make ‘white hexagonal’ snowflakes - vary according to temperature and humidity. ``` 

I am trying to train the transformer model with this plain text data, which is the summary of the article and the article text.

I use OpenAI's gpt-3 to generate summaries that are close to the ones that I have provided in the dataset, but still not perfect. I also used pygpt2 to create these summaries."
41293,4,"The color of snow is influenced by multiple factors, such as size, shape, temperature, and impurities. It can appear white because it reflects most visible light. But certain conditions, such as when it's deep inside snow piles where air spaces are larger and the snow crystals are exposed for longer to light, can sometimes make it look blue or even red due to selective wavelength absorption. A chemistry teacher recently revealed snowflakes come in 35 shapes, which depend on temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Simple shapes like hexagonal snowflakes are more common at low humidity, while more complex flower-like snowflakes are found at high humidity. Snow reflecting mostly the green light is perceived as being green.```

But now that he has done so, it is time for governments and leaders to take action, rather than simply pointing fingers. LaGuardia serves 25 million passengers a year, despite its outdated condition, and is coveted by airlines. New York's airports are responsible for the first and last impressions visitors have and serve a critical role in the region's economic growth. As such, the airports serve as a symbol for the United States, as they are the largest global gateway to the world for international travelers. They also contribute significantly to the tourism industry and the region's economy. As a symbol of underinvestment in infrastructure, airports played a significant role when the Beatles landed in New York 50 years ago last week. Now, they are a symbol of the United States falling behind the rest of the world. Cities realize the significance of their airports and have invested in state-of-the-art technology.```"

## What are the problems:

This problem is a part of the bigger problem of summarization and abstract inference. This is an important problem in AI because it is very difficult for an AI agent to produce a faithful sentence based on a given text. More so if it involves making some conclusion about the text. This may sound simple but it's much more complicated than it sounds. Even humans are much better at it but we can still learn from them. For example, imagine trying to write a summary of this wikipedia article with the following prompt:

```
Summarize this article
```

The model will generate a complete sentence. But it looks as if it copied this sentence from the article. In fact, it has not read the article. It has only seen the exact text in one place, in this case, the article header, or the first few sentences.

## Proposed solution

We propose to generate sentences in two stages. First, inferred sentence + article title. For example, ""The weather is bad in England"" (sentence part) and ""London"" ("

In this example, the summary is shorter than the full article as 1.) The article is a brief news article and 2.) the article contains many links which will be considered in the summary (which is useful for certain applications). 

This project is to construct a multi-lingual language model that can generate human-like text in **21** major languages from different domains. The output should pass the following test:
- The length of the generated text, in number of words, must be within certain percentiles of the source text.
- The generated summary should include all sentences in the source text, or very close variations.
- The generated summary should not include any URLs or lists.

For **training**, the models will be trained on a large number of articles (text), with summaries. For evaluation, the models will be evaluated under the above test on a test set, which consist of full articles (text) with annotated summaries."

25607,0,"Two men, aged 20 and 27, were arrested by Kent Police and remain in custody.``` 

We can observe that only in the first article, the article has more than one sentence. 
This poses a challenge in defining the article boundary.
 In this assignment, you will be asked to implement the summary extraction pipeline.

   ### The Task:

Implement a Python application that has the following abilities:

  1.
Read a URL and output the plain text of the page
The tool should parse and remove the URLs in the HTML.

  2.
Extract the article or articles from a web page by matching patterns.

  3.
Use the extracted article as input to a summarization model such as
[DeepMoji](https://github.com/claire-lau/pytorch-Transformer-LM-Summar"
25607,1,"the police were called out on Tuesday to the car park in Margate Road, Broadstairs,` at 22:15 BST and there they found a young man with serious injuries. The young man (in his 20s) died at the scene. The same police force arrested two men aged 20 and 27 at the scene and those two men also remain in custody. ```
# Instructions

1. Create a new file called `article_extractor/extractor.py`
1. Create a new file called `article_extractor/utilities.py` inside the `utilities.py` file add  an exctractor class to the file with the following functionality

### Methods
#### extract(content)
1. Given a string returns the content of the article as a summary object
2. Must use the following functions (if needed)
    - summarize(content, max_sentences)
    - remove_empty_lines()
    - list_to_string()
    - clean_url()
    - clean_list()

This model generates summaries for both articles from the raw text using an existing [gpt4all-model](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all) pretrained with the [OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) library. The model summarizer can operate in two modes:-
1. ""extractive mode"" which selects sentences from the raw text and generates a summary. There is no filtering at this stage of the selection of the sentences.
2. ""non-extractive mode"" which generates a summary from a pre-processed version of the text. At this stage the sentences from the text are filtered, and only sentences which match the keyword in a context are selected.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Monday thanked U.S. President Donald Trump for the United States' continued support on the issue of a free Basque country.

Rajoy was speaking to reporters in Madrid after meeting with Trump and other European leaders at an informal summit of the European Union in Estonia.

He is part of a European grouping that is pushing for a referendum in the Basque country on independence, after the Trump administration last week urged the EU to consider a referendum on Basque secession.

Trump has long supported Basque independence but, like other U.S. presidents before him, has avoided calling it as a political goal. Instead, he has championed free trade and promoted American jobs and economic growth.

The United States has already imposed tariffs on basque cheese, wine and other products that have hit Basque farmers and winemakers.

Trump has said he would consider lifting the tariffs if Basque independence is agreed to in a referendum, and he told reporters Monday he would continue to work with European partners to secure such an outcome.

If you encounter an error while using this prompt in your Python code, you can try increasing the `n_repeat` argument in the `generate_completion()` function. The default value is set to 3, but if the LLM is struggling to process the long prompt and generate a meaningful response, increasing `n_repeat` can help. In this task, for example, you may be able to use `n_repeat=8` to obtain a more accurate summary using the following code:

The main objective of the text summarization model is to generate a single sentence that captures the essence of a given source text, which is called input.

- Our goal is to condense or summarise long texts into a shorter version that retains the main points and ideas while removing unnecessary details.

- Our input consists of the raw text which contains information and we will have to convert this to shorter text.

48180,3,"The global economy is facing unprecedented challenges due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. Economic growth has slowed considerably across both developed and developing nations. The pandemic caused significant disruptions to supply chains, which have become increasingly complex and interdependent as businesses have outsourced production to multiple locations around the world. This, combined with higher transportation costs and delays in shipments, has contributed to rising prices of goods, leading to high levels of inflation worldwide. In response, many central banks have implemented tight monetary policies in an attempt to dampen rising prices by raising interest rates and curtailing lending. However, this approach has had limited success as prices continue to rise, putting pressure on the already struggling middle class whose income has stagnated since 2011. Geopolitical tensions have also contributed to the challenges facing the global economy. The US's trade war with China has caused a slowdown in economic growth in both countries, particularly since the World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledged in 2020 that COVID-19 was most likely caused by COVID-19. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has also caused inflation to rise"

  But for the summary of that article, we need a lot of work on the preprocessing of texts, because we may encounter many difficulties such as removing the words that do not contribute to describing the content and the synonyms of words, converting the words to their base form, and converting names to their first letter only. These processes require lots of effort if they are all programmed in our model.

The problem is more obvious with long-form content. When someone writes a blog post, an article, or even a long series of tweets to address a topic, the content can be difficult to summarize.

This means that not only will you be missing important facts, but you might omit essential details and change the facts around to fit your understanding of what you want to write about. It is a common practice whereby you use the content as a starting point for your own unique content without giving credit to the original source.

While using article summarizer services is a popular way of finding summaries of content, it's important to be aware that they are often inaccurate. This can lead to a biased understanding of information, which can be problematic if you need to make decisions"

The patient was treated with isotretinoin, which resulted in gradual regression of the lesions. The patient was evaluated with computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for suspected lung cancer. CT scans revealed a well-defined mass on her right lower lobe, and MRI also revealed a mass on her right upper lobe.

Statistics showed that they are disproportionately affected - their odds are stacked against them in almost every measure, from fatherhood to literacy, crime and poverty, with Obama as an exception. He called this an outrage, but was optimistic that the program would help. Obama was flanked by teenagers from Chicago and spoke about how he could relate to them: he had done drugs in his youth. He cited this while emphasizing that these boys of color were an important part of the future of America and deserved equal opportunity. .```"

His comments about his teenage years came as he launched the program"

1968,1,"The Medtronic company uses ‘In better control .  .  .’ as their marketing motto, but there are cases of misuse of Medtronic insulin pumps. In May 2017, a warning about some models of the insulin pump being faulty was given. In 2014, Shayla Walmsley died in her sleep, and her family's legal team is currently examining if that death was caused by a malfunctioning insulin pump. In 2016, a 26-year-old woman, known only as Ffion, was reported to have had a massive overdose, which she spent two days alive through a life support machine. After fully recovering, the MHRA watchdog sent out a warning in May of 2017 regarding the product after Medtronic discovered some products being faulty. They identified mechanical faults that could result in too much insulin being released. Medtronic tested the woman's pump and found it to be fully functional.

1968,3,"Diabetic Financial Journalist Shayla Walmsley, 44, has died in her sleep, leading her parents and lawyer to investigate the possibility that it was due to a malfunctioning insulin pump. Additionally, a 26-year-old woman named Ffion has claimed to have experienced a massive insulin overdose, resulting in her spending two days on a life support machine. The incident took place a year before Shayla's death, and the British Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has warned against the use of one type of insulin pump. It also found that the pump used by Ffion was fully functional. Insulin pumps are designed to release insulin into diabetic patients automatically, making it more manageable than daily injections. The pumps have been known to have mechanical faults, which can cause too much insulin to be released, leading to critical situations. Although the exact causes of Shayla's death are unknown, her parents and lawyer are looking into the possibility that it was due to a malfunctioning insulin pump.

# Problem Definition

The issue of writing a useful summary for an input article is challenging due to the different types of inputs and their varying sizes, as seen from given above.
Summarization of news articles can be useful for users to quickly understand the gist of an article, to identify key points, and to highlight important facts. Additionally, summarization can help improve the readability and engagement of users with long and complex articles, reducing the time and effort required to consume the information.
The task of automatic summarization can improve the accessibility of written content and enable a more efficient and time-conservative experience for users.
Furthermore, automatic summarization can be used in a variety of applications such as information retrieval and data analysis.


# Objective

Given an article, create a short summary to describe the article."
75201,1,"Policy Exchange is recommending several changes to the welfare system, including making the winter fuel payment an 'opt-in' benefit and limiting child benefit to first four children in each household.``` 

 Article: Pensioners should have to opt in to receive the winter fuel payment, said a think-tank close to David Cameron. Policy Exchange also advocated limiting child benefit to four youngsters per household with scaled down weekly payments after the first. These ideas are in the think-tank's welfare manifesto, which is being launched tomorrow with David Blunkett, Labour's former Work and Pensions Secretary. The think-tank added that scrapping automatic entitlement to winter fuel payments - worth up to £300 annually - would save as much as £400million a year. The handout aims to help those unable to heat their home properly but goes to all recipients of the basic state pension. But, Policy Exchange said, just 10 per cent of pensioner households are in fuel poverty. An 'opt-in' system would make it easier for wealthy retirees to decline the benefit. Recipients of pension credit would continue to receive it automatically. Pensioners can cancel"

80577,2,The appeal court has ruled that the UK and Libya should be allowed to litigate Abdul Hakim Belhaj's case. Former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw is alleged to be complicit in his rendition in 2004.``` There are some differences in what the article contains and the summary. The article contains some additional information about the alleged rendition and torture and about the claimant's reaction. The summary only includes the parts of the article which we judge to be relevant for a reader wanting to get an overview of the story. The summary omits the specifics of the rendition and torture because we make the assumption that these specifics do not change which are the main facts of the story. The summary also omits the judgement made by the appeal court and the respondents' reaction. The omission is a deliberate choice because the summary is meant to help any reader looking at it be able to summarise the content and facts of the story. The specifics of the legal procedures are not considered as part of the story's facts. The summary also omits all the legal terminology used to describe the UK's and Libya's arguments.

The judgement was overturned by the Court of Appeal for England and Wales.
The court heard that the MI6 officer Mark Allen, former British military intelligence officer David Shayler and former SAS soldier Simon Mann were allegedly involved in the rendition. The three have said previously they had nothing to do with it.
The court said that, as no-one had been proved to be directly involved in the alleged torture, MI6 and MI5 were protected by the 1989 Intelligence Services Act's ban for ex-spies to go to court over claims about their activities.

 White Britons now make up 45 percent of the population of London compared with 58 percent in 2001, and three London boroughs saw the proportion of Britons fall by more than a quarter.

Colin White was convicted of promoting hatred on the grounds of racial hatred in a case brought in by the Public Prosecution Service in Belfast.
White, 23, of Ballymena, was convicted on two charges at Ballymena Magistrates Court in November 2014.
The charges related to a bonfire in the Ballycraig estate in Ballymena in November 2013.
White was accused of causing ""a riot, riot, or other public disorder, at or around, or in connection with, that particular bonfire on 11 November 2013.""
Both charges were dismissed by the judge as not proven.

# Extractive summarization

In summary text extraction, given a piece of text (e.g., an article), the extraction task aims to generate a set of sentences from it that capture its major content. This task, also called extractive summarization, has a wide range of applications, such as headline generation for news articles, book and report summarization, and providing an explanation for text information.

The goal of this project is twofold. First, we wish to develop an efficient, robust and flexible summarization model. One crucial characteristic required of this model is that it produces a small number of cohesive summaries, so that they closely retain the gist of the original text and are readily readable as a whole. To achieve this, we will train the model using an efficient method which learns the necessary information from a small batch of texts"

34006,2,"The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a unique set of challenges for both public and private sector organisations in relation to their environmental responsibilities. Many organisations found it difficult to remain compliant with changing regulations, particularly in relation to COVID-19 restrictions affecting waste and recycling collection. Moreover, the pandemic has had a significant impact on the financial resources of some businesses, leading to reductions in waste budgets and a greater focus on value for money.
Despite these difficulties, there are several ways in which businesses can still remain environmentally responsible in the post-COVID world. Firstly, it is essential that businesses continue to prioritise the health and safety of their employees and customers. This means taking measures to reduce the spread of harmful pathogens, such as COVID-19, by maintaining social distancing, disinfecting work areas, and providing personal protective equipment.
Businesses should also review their waste management strategies and consider ways in which they can reduce their impacts. For example, businesses should consider implementing more efficient waste management systems, including reducing the amount of"
34006,3,"The Cochno Stone, a cup and ring-marked sandstone monument dating back around 4,500 years has been uncovered at a site near Clydebank after being covered by mud for 60 years. The Neolithic monument was located by archaeologists during construction work at the site of the former Faifley Quarry, Clydebank in 2014 and it is the largest such artwork known in Scotland. The stone covers around two hundred and fifty square meters. In the early 1930’s the site was covered with around 40,000 tons of soil after the surface had been damaged by quarrying and exposure to weather. After its rediscovery archaeologists realized that this monument was different from others in that it was a continuous image instead of individual cups and rings and may have an astrological purpose. This is supported by the orientation of the monument on a north-south alignment, suggesting that the position may have had some association with the astronomical observation of the sunset. Experts estimate that the site was carved in around 3600 BC on the basis of the fact that such markings are generally attributed to the Neolithic period"

Relations between Russia and the U.S. have deteriorated of late, with Moscow expressing fury over the U.S. strikes on a Syrian airbase last month and Washington retaliating by sanctioning some of its businessmen and politicians.
The ambassador also says that Russia may consider increasing troop levels in Syria. ""If needed, we will increase the grouping of servicemen in Syria,"" he is quoted as saying.

But what are the facts, and who exactly in the Trump administration has been responsible for building the cases against Assad that Trump has said were used to support military strikes against his government?
 The facts about chemical weapon use in Syria are murky at best. But the decision to strike Syria was made at least in part due to the actions of one top administration official: Trump’s national security adviser, HR McMaster.
 In his recent visit at a Pentagon-based military base in Jordan, McMaster ordered a special briefing with a senior US military official from the base to learn more about what the US military knew about Damascus’ use of chemical weapons against civilians.
 The senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, provided McMaster with information about what the United States knew of the Syrian government’s chemical weapon use. According to the official, the Syrian military “has engaged in a pattern of indiscriminate attacks against civilian populations"

51024,4,"""The United States and Russia are two of the world's great powers and, inevitably, find themselves negotiating with each other on various international issues. Whether it is regarding the ongoing conflict in Syria or the recent missile strikes ordered by President Trump, the two countries are always in the spotlight.
Now, their talks continue to be strained as the US and Russia prepare to hold their annual Strategic Stability Dialogue in Washington this week. The two countries have expressed divergent views on the future of both Syria and North Korea. In the case of Syria, Russia argues that their military operation in the country is legitimate, whereas the United States argues that it is illegal and has called for the immediate end to Russian military operations. US President Donald Trump has also stated that both Russia and China should be held responsible for the alleged chemical attack in Syria as the two countries were ""the guarantors"" of the cessation of hostilities in Syria. ""In the case of North Korea, the United States has made it clear that dialogue cannot continue unless North Korea makes a credible and genuine move towards denuclearisation,"" said a senior State Department official.

Rangers have moved on to the next round of the competition without having to play their final two group matches against Dundee United and St. Mirren.
Rangers are top of the Betfred Premier League with 34 points, and have won 11 of their first 12 games. They have been praised for their performances throughout the season, but there is one area where Rangers need to improve.
Hearts are a very good and effective defensive side, and Rangers struggled to break them down. The Rangers players were sloppy with their passing at times, and it prevented them from creating many chances.
The main problem was that Rangers seemed to have lost their cutting edge in recent games, and that was apparent against Hearts. They were playing against ten men for the majority of the game, so some of the pressure was eased.

The use of weapons such as the nerve agent sarin crosses what President Barack Obama has called a &apos;red line&apos; that would trigger greater American involvement in the crisis. In a telephone call with British Prime Minister David Cameron tonight, Obama will discuss their plan to warn Russian President and Syrian ally Vladimir Putin of the prospect of military intervention if he doesn&apos;t back down on Syria. The leaders are expected to warn Putin of the dangerous consequences of Russia&apos;s supporting Syria at the G8 conference in Northern Ireland, which begins on Monday. According to the Wall Street Journal, the White House is now considering arming the opposition fighters and enforcing a no-fly zone that could cost an estimated $50 million a day.

Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund has lowered its 2022 and 2023 growth forecasts for the economies of East Asia and the Pacific by up to 2.7 percentage points from its April forecasts. High inflation has slowed economic growth and contributed to rising poverty rates in emerging economies, while supply chain disruptions have exacerbated the impacts of inflation on households. In response, governments have implemented a variety of support packages to stabilize markets and boost economic growth, focusing on investments in green energy and digitalization of services.

According to the new figures, the number of over-40s looking for rooms on websites has doubled since 2009. A decade ago, the US sitcom Friends portrayed 20-somethings sharing, but now the over-40s are doing it, too. A combination of divorce and rising house prices are to blame for the surge in middle-aged people. The over-40s are living with people half their age, which is a reflection of society's geared-towards-couples approach. The number of advertised flat-shares from the over-40s has surged by 50%, but the true figure is likely to be much higher. The reason for this is because some 40-somethings are too embarrassed to post an ad due to their age.

The reasons for them wanting to share a room are divided between those whose relationships have broken down and those who can't afford to get onto the property ladder. The average age of people using the site is 28, and many 40-somethings are embarrassed about their age, so they may end up living with people half their age.

# Summary

    In this repo, we explored the usage of summarization models on the BBC article dataset provided. Several models were tested and analyzed, including the T5 model, GPT-3, GPT-J, and OpenAI GPT. We generated summaries from the dataset based on their respective prompt and context. The T5 model proved to be the best performer on this dataset in the overall evaluation metric. While the model is not the most recent summarization model (using the old 30B T5 model), its performance still outshined some of the other models. Overall, the analysis and results provided in this README have contributed to our understanding of how summarization models operate and how to best use them for summarization tasks."

Policy reforms have also been implemented to address the root causes of the current economic situation. Many developing countries are now turning to green growth policies to tackle the economic and environmental challenges caused by climate change.

# Model outputs

# Original

This code aims to use a large language model like GPT-3 to generate abstract summaries of news articles. It takes in a list of articles with plaintext summaries, then iterates through each article using the `openai.Completions.create` function to generate a response based on the news article's summary. The output of each iteration is then compared to the original plaintext summary sentence. If the results are satisfactory, it then proceeds to the next article.

Code: 

    # Set up an API key
OPENAI_API_KEY = ""xxxx""

# Get the summary (only one sentence) from the main news.com article.

 In a newsroom, a human journalist would typically start with reading the whole article to extract the key ideas. Then, she would start writing a summary. The journalist would most likely use these key ideas to write the summary, rather than rewriting everything from the article in her own words. There is a chance that the journalist would add new information or ideas to the summary, but that would be the exception rather than the norm.

The idea of mixing the savoury and salty taste of Marmite with the sweetness of chocolate is not the first flavour combination that would spring to mind – even for the likes of chemistry set chefs like Heston Blumenthal. While a distinctly British product, the name came from the French word to describe a large, covered earthenware or metal cooking pot. It was originally made from yeast supplied by the Bass brewery and became so popular that a second factory was opened in Camberwell Green, London, in 1907. In the early 1900s it was revered as a health food because it is rich in B vitamins and was issued to British troops in the First World War as part of their rations to stave off conditions such as beriberi, which left them feeling weak and sick.

In addition, the company released a new Marmite-flavored chocolate bar earlier this year with Nestlé to mark the brand's 120th anniversary. However, the new chocolate eggs may not be universally loved by the public, as Marmite has a strong love-it-or-hate-it reputation. Regardless, the Marmite egg is sure to draw attention to an already popular holiday. While some individuals adore Marmite, others find it unpleasant. Some people have even referred to Marmite as ""the food of love"" due to the strong feelings it can inspire. The product could appeal to people who have strong feelings about the savory paste, be they positive or negative. It is likely that the new products from Unilever will receive a mixed response, but consumers may take the opportunity to try them regardless of their feelings.

35044,3,"Scientists from the University of East Anglia (UEA) say the device - the size of a USB stick - can detect bacteria directly from urine samples four times more quickly than traditional methods. The technology could lead to faster treatment and better use of antibiotics, they say.
Prof David Livermore, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said there was a need to move beyond the current ""carpet-bombing"" approach to treating urinary tract infections (UTIs).
""The way to do so lies in accelerating laboratory investigation, so that treatment can be refined earlier, benefitting the patient, who gets an effective antibiotic, and society, whose diminishing stock of antibiotics is better managed,"" he said.
The device can also detect resistance to antibiotics, said Dr Justin O'Grady, also from UEA's Norwich Medical School.
""Swift results like these will make it possible to refine a patient's treatment much earlier - and that's good for the patient, who gets the 'right' antibiotic, and for society - which can better manage or 'steward' its limited supply of antibiotics,"" he said"

Dogecoin has developed into a decentralized global digital currency that is mostly aimed at the crypto-enthusiastic community. Today there are about 100B coins in circulation, after a gradual increase in inflation which originally stood at 150%.

One particular challenge is the rising cost of living, especially for essential goods and services. This trend is driven by higher energy prices, supply chain disruptions, and a weakening of the global economic recovery. High energy prices are a major factor in increasing the cost of living, as energy represents a significant portion of household expenditure. In addition, supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions are driving up prices for commodities and other goods, leading to higher inflation rates in developing and developed nations.

As a result, low-income families often struggle to make ends meet, as they are more vulnerable to economic shocks. The"

The pandemic has caused disruptions in supply chains and has led to lower consumer spending and business investment. The war in Ukraine has caused oil and gas prices to rise, and has led to shortages of food and energy supplies in many countries. Additionally, climate change is causing extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, which are having a negative impact on crops and livestock, and leading to food shortages in some areas.The impact of these challenges on the global economy is widespread. Some countries are experiencing high inflation, which is reducing the purchasing power of consumers and businesses. Others are facing declining rates of economic growth, as investment in new technology and infrastructure is being curtailed. Many emerging markets are facing currency depreciation, as they are unable to balance their current account deficits.

1. Find entities in the text of the article, then find the relation between these entities.
2. Finding the summary of a text by using GPT.
What we learn:

## Entities:
Entities refers to objects, concepts, or characters that have significance in a specific context. They are identified by their unique identifiers, such as entityID, and are often used to enhance the specificity and accuracy of communication and information retrieval.

Relationships/links:
Relationships or links represent connections between two or more entities, signifying how they are associated or associated with each other. These connections are often denoted with relationshipIDs and can be used to provide context or structure to a text.

For instance, in the following example, the entities are the concepts or objects that have individual identifiers, and the relationships or links connect these entities with their respective identifiers:

Ryon was asleep on the couch at the time. According to the affidavit, Miss Bardell woke up her boyfriend and asked him to check on their daughter while she made lunch. He went to the bedroom and returned to tell her that the baby was fine. A short time later Miss Bardell discovered her unconscious child and frantically called 911.

- South America's second-largest economy has been through so many different economic policies and experiments in the past two decades that a whole new vocabulary has sprung up to explain day-to-day economic transactions.

- Some traders prefer to ""make puree"" (""hacer puré""), which is to buy dollars from the government and resell them to the ""caves"" (""cuevas""), the illegal exchange rate shops that deal with ""blue"" (black-market) dollars.
- This dynamic jargon is a reflex of a country that has been through a sort of economic rollercoaster ride for the past 15 years.

75354,2,"The unemployment rate fell to 6.6% due to stronger job creation in January after a weak December. In the third quarter, the US economy grew at its fastest pace in two years. The 113,000 new jobs added in January lagged the 180,000 that economists predicted and fall far short of what's required to sustain economic growth. However, the unemployment rate is a more comprehensive measure that takes into account both those who have jobs and those who are looking for work. It is an indication of how well the economy is functioning over time. The rise in unemployment is likely to result in fewer people being able to find work, leading to a sluggish economy that will put pressure on policy makers looking to spur growth. As a result, the unemployment rate is likely to remain at the current levels for the foreseeable future. With the unemployment rate falling to 6.6%, the labor market is showing signs of improvement and may finally begin to put pressure on wages to move higher. Overall, the economy is recovering, but there are still areas of weakness, particularly in manufacturing and construction, that will need to be addressed.```

Arguably, the new £249.99 device is the biggest innovation since Sir James Dyson first launched his bagless vacuum cleaners 20 years ago. Importantly, it taps in to the growing desire among householders for cordless machines, which are not tied up in a cat's cradle of cables.

Again, the new device has the advantage that it is more convenient. There are no power cables, no water tank to fill or delay while it heats up.

About 300 of the shirts that have been turned in as part of a free exchange offer are youth sizes, the Patriots reported Sunday. Hernandez was arrested June 26 and charged with murder in the death of a friend, Odin Lloyd. Prosecutors say Hernandez had a falling-out with Lloyd at a nightclub and planned his execution-style killing in the following days. After prosecutors brought charges against Hernandez, the Patriots offered fans who had purchased Hernandez jerseys the chance to trade them in.

 ""We know that children love wearing their Patriots jerseys, but may not understand why parents don't want them wearing their Hernandez jerseys anymore,"" spokesman Stacey James said in announcing the offer last week.

The news of his untimely death sent shockwaves through the sports world, sparking questions from fans and media alike. Hernandez’s death came as a surprise to many due to his young age and the apparent good health he had maintained during his incarceration. Reactions to the news of Hernandez’s demise were mixed, with some expressing sympathy for his family, while others speculated about the alleged mistreatment or poor living conditions that may have contributed to his suicide. In an official statement, Nike, from whose jerseys Hernandez had previously had his name and number included, revealed that it would no longer be selling his merchandise and would instead be donating all proceeds to “organizations dedicated to improving the lives of children.” Despite the controversy surrounding Hernandez’s death, Nike’s decision to discontinue sales of his jersey and support children’s causes demonstrates the company’s commitment to social responsibility.

Article:   ```The Australian government is considering a $40 billion infrastructure investment program to boost economic growth, spurring employment and encouraging private investment. However, concerns have been raised by economists about the lack of transparency and oversight in the allocation of funds. Critics argue that the program lacks clear criteria for project selection and has failed to prioritize investment in rural Australia, where infrastructure needs are greatest.
Moreover, the program has been plagued by political interference, with some projects seemingly selected on political rather than economic grounds. While the government has sought to address these concerns by strengthening governance mechanisms and imposing conditions on spending, critics maintain that the program lacks accountability and could eventually lead to waste and corruption.```

The generated summary, which must have the same meaning and convey the same information as the text but be much shorter, is:
```

This summary is very close to the mark in terms of capturing the essence of the article's content. However, there are a few areas that could be improved. Firstly, the summary contains some extraneous information that is not directly related to the article's content. For example, mentioning that Thierry Henry currently plays for MLS side New York Red Bulls and that he does not need to return to the United States until March is unnecessary in this context. The focus should be on capturing the main idea of the article, rather than including irrelevant details. Additionally, while the summary does mention Henry's record as Arsenal's record goalscorer, it does not explicitly state how many goals he scored for the club, which could be helpful in providing context for the article's main idea.


Overall, this summary is a good starting point and captures many of the key points from the article. However, it would benefit from more careful editing to remove extraneous details and provide greater clarity and precision"

29108,2,David Ranta spent 23 years behind bars for murdering a Brooklyn rabbi. Recently the witness against him recanted his testimony and now the Brooklyn DA believes him to be innocent.```
29108,3,"Ranta was a felon in 1991 who was allegedly paid $8,000 to steal gems from a rabbi during a robbery gone wrong. Ranta shot the rabbi and his driver before fleeing the scene.

A witness, James Lowe, was shown a photo array that contained Ranta and picked him out as the suspect. Lowe was sentenced to 4 to 12 years in prison for his role in the murder.

In 2016, Lowe retracted his testimony and identified another man, Krawczyk, who actually carried out the robbery. Krawczyk had confessed to being the triggerman to detectives during a separate investigation.

On Thursday, a judge held a retrial where Lowe again identified Ranta as the suspect. Judge Frank Nervo said Ranta was entitled to a new trial because Lowe was a key witness.

Krawczyk later told the Associated Press that he had only confessed to shooting the rabbi under intense interrogation and in exchange for leniency in his own case. Ranta was sentenced to 25 years to life for the murder."

The text of the article has more information than the summary does. For instance, the summary does not mention that the motorists who were being fined had done no wrong. It is not clear why this is the case.
The text of the summary itself is also more readable. The article, as is typical of the type it represents, is full of jargon, whereas the summary uses easier to understand language.

Given these two points and the context of the article in question (a BBC local news bulletin), we can conclude that this article is a biased summary of the original. This was achieved by making a small change to the data (removing URLs and list elements) and using slightly less readable, more technical language.

2811,3,"The Department for Infrastructure has now issued revised guidelines and amended its website for motorists who inadvertently used bus lanes without incurring any penalty. New signage clearly highlighting the amendment has also been erected. Six cameras and a mobile detection unit were introduced in 2015 to target illegal use of bus lanes; however, the automated timing of the equipment did not take into account the length of time taken by a vehicle to pull into a bus lane while moving from one lane to another, meaning that some cars were wrongly penalised. Following a legal challenge, the Department for Infrastructure revised its guidelines and amended its website regarding misuse of bus lanes. The Department has now introduced new signage providing a timeline of one hour. Any driver detected exceeding this period of time without turning right using a bus lane will receive a Penalty Notice. The 23-lane network, in Belfast, is also set to be expanded by eight lanes by the end of 2017. The cameras are positioned to record the entire journey and can distinguish between a ""left turn"" or a ""right turn"" on entering a bus lane, and will issue penalties accordingly."

  The above plain-text summary is very informative, but it is very long and not very structured, which makes it harder to understand. Therefore, we propose a new method, ```SummAI``` to automatically generate concise and structured plain-text summaries of news articles. Our model's main contributions are as follows:
  * The model uses the most relevant sentences to generate concise plain-text summaries of news articles.
  * The model generates structured plain-text summaries using the information in the article to organize the summary sentences.
  * The model is able to generate plain-text summaries more concisely than previous models and with higher precision.

The first is an anesthetic, followed by a paralytic and then a drug to stop the heart. But Arizona's lethal injection protocol includes midazolam, which has been linked to botched executions. The long duration of Wood's death has reopened the debate about capital punishment in the United States. Some states still use lethal injection as the method of execution, while others have abandoned it in favor of other methods.```

57489,4,"Arizona spent two hours killing a prisoner on death row, Joseph Wood, this week. According to reports, Wood gasped for breath and appeared to be in pain. The state said that Wood did not suffer. Death penalty opponents say the issue relates to lethal injection, used in all 32 states that carry out executions. Typically, executions are carried out using three drugs. First is an anesthetic, then a second drug, a paralytic, and then a third drug. Lethal injection relies on a drug called midazolam as the anesthetic. Other states still use a drug called sodium thiopental that puts prisoners to sleep. Midazolam has caused problems in at least three executions. Experts say midazolam would make the inmate unable to feel pain. But many experts say that midazolam isn't an option. Arizona executed another inmate, Dennis McGuire, on January 16. He gasped, choked and snored. He took 26 minutes to die.

He was swimming in the Hudson River on August 3 when he suffered cardiac arrest and started drowning in the water. He was spotted by a lifeguard who took him to a boat. LaPak's parents both died of heart attacks in their 50s - but by the time he was 52, he had already completed three marathons and had signed up for the triathlon in New York City last August.

He woke up several days later, but the doctors revealed later that the lifeguards had reacted quickly and saved his life, because if he had been submerged in the water for a longer period of time, he would have died. The New York triathlon is a tough race with a long, arduous swim, followed by a brisk open water bike race, which is followed by a long, arduous run. The race has over 130 athletes, and a significant percentage are from Long Island. Many of the participants are local celebrities and local politicians.

Inflation occurs when there is an excess supply of money chasing too few goods, which causes prices to rise . When prices go up , people get paid less and work longer hours as they struggle to make ends meet . If this continues long enough , there can be a recession in our economy . In a recession the number of jobs available can decrease while prices remain unaffected . So if you're unemployed or want more hours then you would've been forced to work less hours because there aren't enough jobs available . This leaves those who do have jobs with less spending power because they now have to spend more for similar services than before . This then leads to further price increases and inflation .

2. **Against:** Some people may have made the decision to contact the provider already during the previous days, leading to potential disruption in service delivery if the providers did not anticipate this increase in the workload.

It said that parliamentarians' preferred option is to stay in the EU, adding that the issue should not be 'taken out of the hands of those MPs and placed in the hands of the electorate' until after the next general election. Those who supported the motion argued that a referendum should be held, as British people have been repeatedly informed that a referendum will be held.

The US's Consumer Price Index rose 9.1% in June from a year ago - the highest increase in four decades. According to the World Bank, lower-income countries have been hit the hardest by rising prices. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund projected global growth to slow down to 2.9% this year, down from 6% in 2021. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said the world is ""dangerously close"" to a recession. Countries like China, whose growth was already lagging, could be hit the hardest. The OECD's Chief Economist said this would mean more people living in poverty, with higher cost pressures and economic insecurity causing a drop in consumption, investment, and business investment.

The robbers took a suitcase from the boot of the official's car which contained 162,000 Euros, $30,000 and £10,000. Driving a car equipped with flashing blue lights with 'police' written on it, the thieves pulled the diplomat over on the A1 just outside of the French capital. The armed men demanded an inspection of the car boot and said they were 'confiscating' the suitcase before telling the official, who had just landed at the private Le Bourget airport on Monday, he was 'free to go'. A French police spokesman said: 'It is unclear why he was carrying so much cash. We do not know if the robbers were working on a tip off or simply got lucky.' He confirmed that officers in the Seine-Saint-Denis department were investigating the theft. The robbery is the latest in a string of thefts on wealthy visitors to Paris."

83743,3,"The Chinese economy grew 7 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, marking an improvement from the first three months of the year. The GDP growth rate was in line with expectations. The robust growth was driven mainly by manufacturing, construction and infrastructure projects and government stimulus, as well as increased domestic spending during the public holiday. This follows the Chinese government's efforts to boost the slowing economy, especially after the stock market plunge. GDP growth in the first quarter stood at 7 per cent, down from 7.
3 per cent in the last quarter of 2014. A rebound in the second quarter indicates that stimulative measures might be bearing fruit.

83743,4,"In China, the economy grew 7% from a year ago - matching growth in the first three months of the year, which was the lowest since 2009 when it fell to 6.6%.
A weaker property market and factory production have hampered growth.
But, Beijing has rolled out a series of stimulus measures amid the slowdown.
The central bank cut interest rates for the fourth time since November last month to boost economic activity.
Growth was expected to dip below the 7% mark and come in at 6.9% for the April to June quarter.
Sure, the data may well be massaged, manipulated and to some extent made up.
And critics of the whole concept will argue that attempting to sum up three months' worth of Chinese economic growth in a single number is as futile as trying to sum up the political events of the past three months in a single word.
But if seen as simply the best estimate that China feels comfortable publishing then it is useful, both in terms of the trend and in terms of what it may tell us about government thinking.
The 7% figure is certainly confirmation that growth remains flat at best, unchanged since the first quarter,"

# 💠How It's Made
A Python script is used to find articles, scrape the data, and create .json files with all available data. Then, using HuggingFace Transformers (PyTorch-Electra), I trained a model using the data from 1M+ CNN news articles to summarize using different prompts. [HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)

 - The script first fetches the most recent **50,000** articles from [https://newsapi.org/](https://newsapi.org/).
 - This data is saved in .json files for each article.
 - A **HuggingFace Transformer** fine-tunes a model on this data.
After that :
 - The model generates 3 summaries per news articles: **short summary, medium summary, long summary**

Butbecause, predictably, those laudatory words will be thrown around so casually on Sunday, perhaps we can take a few minutes here to address an act of genuine valor that happened exactly 70 years ago today. It wasn't televised. There were no sponsors. On February 3, 1943, an Army transport ship called the Dorchester, carrying American soldiers through the icy North Atlantic on their way to serve in World War II, was about 100 miles off the coast of Greenland in rough sea. More than 900 people were on board. Many of them were little more than boys.```"
6627,3,"An Army transport ship, Dorchester, was carrying American soldiers through the icy North Atlantic on their way to serve in World War II. The heavy seas caused the Dorchester to capsize. The Dorchester had its own chaplains, four men who prayed during the sinking and encouraged the men with songs of faith. The Dorchester hit a German submarine torpedo with 900 men and women onboard. The Dorchester was hit by a German submarine torpedo, causing the ship to capsize, killing the 900 U.S. servicemen and women on board. Four chaplains had been serving on the Dorchester for months, and each held the hand of a member of each other's respective religions and calmed the passengers during the sinking. It is a famous story told in American schools about the sacrifices those chaplains made.

In a matter of moments, over one hundred survivors managed to climb onto lifeboats. In these boats, they tried to find a way to safety. But soon, they faced a difficult situation: they ran out of drinking water, food and fuel. They were also exposed to the frigid weather. As the hours passed, it became clear that the situation had become worse. Some of the boats that had drifted away from the ship had either capsized or sunk, causing many of the sailors to perish. The remaining boat soon became caught in the strong currents. In these boats, they tried to find ways to save themselves. After several days at sea, with no sign of rescue in sight, they began to lose hope. Most of the sailors managed to climb into the life"

&nbsp&nbsp(A)&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Incorrect: The plain-text summary of the last paragraph of the article:<br />In the plain-text summary of the last paragraph, ""was"" is a keyword. If we replace it with ""had been"", the plain-text summary will still hold. <em>Explanation: The plain-text summary of the last paragraph says that ""she tried to walk home from a party"". Because ""tried"" is a form of action, a past participle, it implies that ""was"" in the plain-text summary is in the past tense.

However, the police realized their mistake moments later and ordered the mother back to the car. The incident has left the family shaken and the mother is still upset, especially because her 6-year-old godson was made to get out of the car. It also highlights the importance of accurate and timely reporting to avoid unnecessary tension and potential confrontations.```

Unfortunately, this number is decreasing rapidly, as the ocean’s temperatures are rising, and coral mortality rates are increasing. Coral-based ecosystems are essential, as they provide habitat for about 25 percent of all marine life, including fish, sharks, sea turtles, manta rays and sea urchins. Besides, coral reefs buffer shores against strong waves, making coastal areas safer. These reefs also act as a natural barrier protecting our beaches and shorelines from erosion. Coral reefs are an ideal source of food for humans and marine species. The seaweed and fish that feeds on the reefs are a great source of food. In addition, fish species harvested for commercial purposes, such as tuna, cod, and salmon, rely heavily on healthy coral reefs. They provide shelter, nursery areas and food for these species.

The change is said to be motivated by the belief that people do not take the current oath seriously. Critics, such as the Rt Rev Michael Nazir-Ali, a former Bishop of Rochester, believe that the proposed changes could pave the way towards the increasing secularisation of society. Meanwhile, others argue that the change could be seen as a positive shift away from religious references and towards a more inclusive and non-discriminatory judicial system. However, it is important to note that while the Bible is bound up with the constitution, institutions and history of the United Kingdom, it is up to the government to balance religious freedom and equality with the maintenance of these historical and cultural standards.```

Maigstrates could move to end the ancient tradition of swearing on the Bible to tell the truth in court. Instead, witnesses and defendants would pledge not to lie without mentioning God – and could be jailed if they are caught out. Critics say the controversial plan would undermine Britain’s Christian heritage. Oath: Magistrates are considering scrapping the tradition of swearing on the Bible to tell the truth in court. The Magistrates’ Association, which represents 23,000 lay magistrates, will this month discuss concerns that many people do not take the oath seriously. If its policy committee approves the changes it will draft proposals to send to the Ministry of Justice.
