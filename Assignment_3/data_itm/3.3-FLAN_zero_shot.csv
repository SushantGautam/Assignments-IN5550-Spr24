18903,0,The ‘Meta-Perceptual Helmets’ use optical tricks to allow people to experience what animals see with their eyes. They are inspired by pioneering experiments by psychologist George Malcolm Stratton in the early twentieth century. The helmets from Clearly Connolly are now on display at the Centre Culturel Irlandais in Paris until February.
18903,1,"The metal devices use optical tricks to enable people to experience how animals view the world. They work in a similar way to a periscope to achieve desired effect such as seeing backwards and elevation. Irish artists Clearly Connolly were inspired to make the helmets after investigating pioneering experiments by psychologist George M Stratton in the early 20th century. He wore specially adapted glasses for over a week in the early 20th century that inverted images up and down and left and right, and discovered that the human brain could adapt to these newly inverted visual conditions. The helmets are designed to make wearers question why humans see the world as we do and why our vision is so limited (the helmets are inspired by studies from the early 20th century). The helmets offer the opportunity to see the world through the eyes of a hammerhead shark, a chameleon, a giraffe or a horse, both for real and imaginative experiences."
18903,2,"Irish artists Clearly Connolly have spent years developing a series of hand-crafted aluminium helmets which explore ‘the mysteries of visual perception’ The metal devices use optical tricks to enable people to experience the hyper-stereo vision of a hammerhead shark, or the 357° view of a horse running in the Grand National. The ‘Meta-Perceptual Helmets’ enables people to see through animals’ eyes by using mirrors which project light from a person’s eyeball. Wearers are able to see backwards or at an elevated level, for example, without lifting their head and can also see in two dimensions, or two separate directions at the same time. One ‘metal spout’ helmet lets wearers experience the backward/forward vision of a chameleon while another enables them to see like a horse, which has the challenging blind spot at the centre of its vision, as if their eyes are on the sides of their head. The artist’s were inspired to make the helmets after exploring the pioneering experiments by psychologist George Malcolm Stratton in the early twentieth century. He wore specially adapted glasses that turned the world upside down and swapped left and right for over a week - an experience initially unpleasant and disorientating. But after a few days, the scientist’s brain learned to make sense of the visual information, and he found that his upside-down world felt relatively normal, indicating his brain adapted relatively easily to the changes."
18903,3,Sleek aluminium helmets show 357° view of horse at the beginning or end of run. ‘Meta-Perceptual Helmets’ show how different animals see in three dimensions. Researchers say animals' vision is adapted over hundreds of millions of years.

NASA hopes that the slowdown will be enough to return the shuttle in time for the end of the year, but the problem has persisted."

Ms Shepherd passed away after she suffered an amniotic fluid embolism - a rare complication only occurred 6.1 times in every 100,000 deliveries.

Mr Kelly said the couple had never heard of an amniotic fluid embolism and never predicted anything like this could happen. He said he was glad there were so many people out there who would be able to tell their son what type of person his mother was. 'It is the number one cause for maternal death in developed nations, but no one I know or had spoken to had any real knowledge about it,' he said. According to statistics the likelihood of suffering an amniotic fluid embolism is one in 20,000 births, and one every 100,000 deliveries. Ms Shepherd was only 46 weeks pregnant at the time of passing, with her son, born via Caesarean Section at the Perth Private Hospital.

Dr Douglas Zipes, who conducted the analysis, referred to Tasers as ""non-lethal but potentially deadly"" weapons for the devices' potential to shut down the heart, with one heart attack resulting in cardiac arrest. Dr Zipes analysed X26 Taser model records of medical investigations, deaths and Taser use data."

The study, conducted by Dr Douglas Zipes, and appearing in American Heart Association's medical journal, analysed information such as autopsy reports, medical records and police data in cases where people had lost consciousness after being shocked by the Taser X26 model. About 334 Taser-related deaths have been reported between 2001 and 2008, according to Amnesty International. Dr Zipes also notes that unlike guns, Tasers are not subject to regulation by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms because they don’t involve the use of gun powder. Circulation, the AHA's own medical journal, published the findings in what is believed to be the first peer-reviewed study linking the devices to heart trauma and death. An evaluation of the X26 in pigs, sheep and people established that shocks to the chest caused cardiac electrical capture."

Ivory Coast defeated Ghana 9-8 on penalties after a 0-0 90-minute drawn, which went into extra time. It was a classic final as Wilfried Bony failed to get into the game, as both the Ivorian and Ghana side struggled to break down their opponents. Both sides had penalties saved by their keepers, with Ghana's Razak Braimah's effort saved in a penalty shoot-out on Sunday night. Ivory Coast's Boubacar Barry saved the kick and then stepped up to score the winning spot-kick, denying Ghana an outright victory. Christian Atsu was Africa Champion's best player. The game was notable for Ghana's Christian Atsu being the best player on the pitch during the game, while the Ivorians were unable to beat Southampton's Boubacar Barry with the ball due to the former Arsenal keeper's excellent saves in the shoot-out. Ghana's Christian Atsu was lucky not to receive a red card after repeatedly stamping on Eric Bailly and Serey Die at the AFCON final. Manchester City's Wilfried Bony missed his penalty early on in the shoot-out, with his effort crashing off the crossbar."
